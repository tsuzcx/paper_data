In this paper, a low-cost and lightweight mobile robot is proposed for hotel room service. For delivering any item that customers need, the robot should be able to manipulate elevators in an unmanned hotels. So, it is separated into three parts: elevator button detection, coordinate transform and fuzzy logical control to manipulate the robotic arm. To recognize and detect a variety of elevator panels and buttons, a large number of the images are collected and labeled manually by ourselves. With state-of-the-art deep learning framework, our model has achieved 95.172 mean average precision (mAP) even in elevators that are not included in training data. After properly detecting the elevator buttons, the 3D position corresponding to each elevator button is transformed by the fusion of two sensors which are a mono-camera and a Lidar. This paper presents a coordinates transform neural network to estimate real world position, and our method achieves in an average distance error of 1.356 mm. The fuzzy logical controllers are designed for manipulating the robotic arm fast and smoothly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8520030/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18202166","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Mobile Robot Controller Design for Hotel Room Service with Deep Learning Arm-Based Elevator Manipulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Mobile Robot Controller Design for Hotel Room Service with Deep Learning Arm-Based Elevator Manipulator","confLoc":"New Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056836S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500054","isNumber":"8519965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500054","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8519965","articleId":"8520030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":8520032,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Yang Chiu","affiliation":["The Department of Information Communication, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Sheng-Yang","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37086503739"},{"name":"Jui-Chien Hsieh","affiliation":["The Department of Information Communication, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Jui-Chien","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37086506094"},{"name":"Chi-I Hsu","affiliation":["Department. of Information Management, Kainan University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Chi-I","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37086502759"},{"name":"Chaochang Chiu","affiliation":["The Department of Information Communication, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Chaochang","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37290428300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6285-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6284-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6286-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0925"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-0909"}],"articleNumber":"8520032","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Networks Approach with Infrared Array Sensor for Bed-Exit Detection","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500054/8519965/08520032.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSE.2018.8520032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8519965","doi":"10.1109/ICSSE.2018.8520032","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical monitoring","Sensor arrays","Temperature sensors","Temperature distribution","Convolutional neural networks","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alarm systems","biomedical equipment","electric sensing devices","feedforward neural nets","handicapped aids","learning (artificial intelligence)","microcomputers","patient monitoring","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wearable technology","artificial intelligence","effective bed exit alarm systems","deep learning algorithm","bed exit detection model","monitored behavior information","infrared array sensor","preliminary experiment results","bed-exit events","convolutional neural networks approach","bed-exit detection","prevention measures","bed exit alarm mechanism","serious attention","innovative ICT advancement","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural network","infrared array sensor","bed-exit","pressure sensitive mats"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520032","abstract":"Among various kinds of falling prevention measures, bed exit alarm mechanism has raised serious attention recently.

Although a machine can equip the capability of radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting, there is a trade-off between RF energy-harvesting rate and the opportunity to send data in a radio band. Therefore, we propose a spectrum hand-off for energy harvesting in cognitive radio based machine type communication networks. Using the proposed spectrum hand-off, a machine can determine (i) the appropriate time that a machine harvests RF energy from which radio band and (ii) the time to send data or sleep such that more energy is gathered from two radio bands and then more data is sent in shorter waiting time. Simulation results show that the proposed spectrum hand-off can yield lower mean packet request delay in light and middle load and increase utilization of time slots (or throughput).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18245395","htmlLink":"/document/8520109/","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Hand-Off for RF Energy Harvesting in Cognitive Radio Based Machine to Machine Communication Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Hand-Off for RF Energy Harvesting in Cognitive Radio Based Machine to Machine Communication Networks","confLoc":"New Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05195S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500054","isNumber":"8519965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500054","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8519965","articleId":"8520109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8520151,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Lin Jeng","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Lin","lastName":"Jeng","id":"37086501674"},{"name":"Sheng-Bo Huang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Bo","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086504052"},{"name":"Chin-Feng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Feng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37289520200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6285-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6284-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6286-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0925"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-0909"}],"articleNumber":"8520151","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Sensors","Anomaly detection","Mobile handsets","Google","Global Positioning System","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","inspection","learning (artificial intelligence)","quality control","road building","road safety","road traffic","roads","sensors","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transportation speeds","traveler safety","damaged roads","information technology","machine learning algorithms","inspection method","road quality inspection","smartphone sensors","anomaly detection algorithm","abnormal road sections","GPS","accelerator sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Road quality monitoring","Crowdsensing","Mobile Sensors","Smartphones"]}],"abstract":"Road quality can be representative of a country's development status, affect transportation speeds and traveler safety. However, there is no standard or set of rules to protect people from the dangers of damaged roads. This study proposes a method for evaluating road quality, which has been made possible by the recent rapid development of information technology and machine learning algorithms, and the popularity and widespread use of smartphones. The proposed inspection method is a road quality inspection APP which collects raw data from smartphone sensors, including GPS and accelerator sensors. Once the data is collected, the server side of the proposed system runs an anomaly detection algorithm to interpret the recorded oscillating amplitude of a specific section of road. The calculated results are then added to the Google Maps app, and abnormal road sections are marked in different colors.","doi":"10.1109/ICSSE.2018.8520151","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500054/8519965/08520151.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSE.2018.8520151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8519965","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inspect Road Quality by Using Anomaly Detection Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inspect Road Quality by Using Anomaly Detection Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520151/","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18202167","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8520151/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inspect Road Quality by Using Anomaly Detection Approach","confLoc":"New Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059505S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500054","isNumber":"8519965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500054","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8519965","articleId":"8520151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8520227,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang Thi Tu Uyen","affiliation":["University of Science Technology"],"firstName":"Hoang","lastName":"Thi Tu Uyen","id":"37086502498"},{"name":"Pham Duc Tuan","affiliation":["University of Science Technology"],"firstName":"Pham","lastName":"Duc Tuan","id":"37086503080"},{"name":"Le Viet Anh","affiliation":["University of Science Technology"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Viet Anh","id":"37086504773"},{"name":"Phan Xuan Minh","affiliation":["University of Science Technology"],"firstName":"Phan","lastName":"Xuan Minh","id":"37086504551"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6285-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6284-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6286-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0925"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-0909"}],"articleNumber":"8520227","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Neural networks","Vehicle dynamics","Uncertainty","Adaptive systems","Backstepping","Sea surface"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control engineering computing","control nonlinearities","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","ships","stability","tracking","uncertain systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural networks","3DOF surface ship","uncertain ship model","ship-model","radial basis function networks","sliding mode backstepping control","adaptive sliding mode backstepping controller","ASMBC","Lyapunov theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520227","abstract":"This paper proposes an adaptive sliding mode backstepping control algorithm for the tracking problem of uncertain ship model based on neural networks.

The shape reconstruction method is based on delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm, enables short range imaging in a particular environment. The images of the multiple aspects of the target are obtained by superimposing the data calculated at different positions. The experiment was performed on several targets with different shapes under a sparse cross array topology with an antenna spacing of 2.5 lambda and a commercial IR-UWB radar chip with a fractional bandwidth of 34%. According to the experimental results, the 3-D shape of multiple aspects of the target can be reconstructed and provide more information than imaging one aspect. Therefore, the results of this paper show that the more complex shape of the target can be reconstructed by using the proposed method. Furthermore, the method may be used in inspection applications to help make judgments in the future.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Shape Reconstruction Method for Multiple Aspects Using MIMO IR-UWB Radar System","publicationTitle":"2018 9th International Conference on Ultrawideband and Ultrashort Impulse Signals (UWBUSIS)","doi":"10.1109/UWBUSIS.2018.8520235","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 9th International Conference on Ultrawideband and Ultrashort Impulse Signals (UWBUSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8496384/8519963/08520235.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UWBUSIS.2018.8520235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8519963","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"3D Shape Reconstruction Method for Multiple Aspects Using MIMO IR-UWB Radar System","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520235/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18230012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Shape Reconstruction Method for Multiple Aspects Using MIMO IR-UWB Radar System","confLoc":"Odessa, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"247-251-PID5592443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045264S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8496384","isNumber":"8519963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8496384","xplore-issue":"8519963","articleId":"8520235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8520305,"authors":[{"name":"Isaac Odun-Ayo","affiliation":["Covenant University, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Odun-Ayo","id":"37086434259"},{"name":"Olasupo Ajayi","affiliation":["University of Lagos, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Olasupo","lastName":"Ajayi","id":"37086172770"},{"name":"Chinonso Okereke","affiliation":["Covenant University, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Chinonso","lastName":"Okereke","id":"37086522312"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4205-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4206-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8520305","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"abstract":"Cloud computing is an interesting paradigm that is making computing and other related activities easy for consumers. The cloud infrastructure is not new, but it is working on new technology based on various services offered. The cloud provides application software online for users to conduct common activities like word processing. Cloud computing also enables consumers to leverage on cloud infrastructure by designing and deploying their application on the cloud. A unique feature of the cloud is the provision of scalable storage for data which are usually spread across several geographical locations. A core technology used on the cloud is virtualization. This allows virtual machines to be hosted on physical servers. This provides great benefits to users on the cloud. This paper presents the state of the art from some literature available on cloud virtualisation. The study was executed by means of review of some literature available on cloud virtualisation. The study was performed by means of review of some literature using reliable methods. This paper examines present trends in the area of cloud virtualisation and provides a guide for future research. In the present work, the objective is to answer the following question: what is the current trend and development in cloud virtualisation? Papers published in journals, conferences, white papers and those published in reputable magazines were analysed. The expected result at the end of this review is the identification of trends in cloud virtualisation. This will be of benefit to prospective cloud users and even cloud providers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Next Generation Computing and Information Systems (ICNGCIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8519644/8520293/08520305.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Next Generation Computing and Information Systems (ICNGCIS)","doi":"10.1109/ICNGCIS.2017.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNGCIS.2017.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtualization in Cloud Computing: Developments and Trends","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Virtualization","Virtual machining","Operating systems","Hardware","Virtual machine monitors","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud virtualisation","cloud providers","cloud computing","cloud infrastructure","cloud users","virtualization","application software","word processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Virtualization","Applications","Virtual Machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Virtualization in Cloud Computing: Developments and Trends","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520305/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"18216134","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","conferenceDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtualization in Cloud Computing: Developments and Trends","confLoc":"Jammu, India","sourcePdf":"6361a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053698S","chronDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8519644","isNumber":"8520293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8519644","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8520293","articleId":"8520305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8520314,"authors":[{"name":"Meenakshi Bhat","affiliation":["Department of CSE, MIET, Jammu, India"],"firstName":"Meenakshi","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37086523710"},{"name":"Shafalika Vijayal","affiliation":["Department of CSE, MIET, Jammu, India"],"firstName":"Shafalika","lastName":"Vijayal","id":"37086424095"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4205-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4206-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8520314","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bitcoin","Peer-to-peer computing","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contracts","cryptography","electronic money","financial data processing","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptocurrencies","Ethereum","smart contracts","global business transactions","probabilistic analysis","public blockchain network","blockchain technology","big cryptocurrency blockchain project","Bitcoin blockchain","private sector","public sector","perceptive invention"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin","Ethereum","Smart Contracts","Consensus"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520314","abstract":"The blockchain is a perceptive invention - the discovery of a person or group of people.

The blockchain is an imperishable digital log of financial transactions that can be scheduled to record not just efficient transactions but practically everything that holds a price. It enables global business transactions with less conflict and more trust. Blockchain has invented an era into technology in which the digital information can be distributed without being imitated. Bitcoin blockchain is the most popular public blockchain network, with around 10K nodes. The other big cryptocurrency blockchain project is Ethereum. Ethereum however wasn't designed to be a form of currency but instead it is intended to enable \"smart contracts\". Many cryptocurrencies are built on the top of blockchain, with the most popular being Bitcoin. In this paper we are going to present an overview of the blockchain technology with focus on two most widely used cryptocurrencies and their comparative analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICNGCIS.2017.37","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Next Generation Computing and Information Systems (ICNGCIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Next Generation Computing and Information Systems (ICNGCIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8519644/8520293/08520314.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNGCIS.2017.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic Analysis on Crypto-Currencies Based on Blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Analysis on Crypto-Currencies Based on Blockchain","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18216130","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8520314/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","conferenceDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Analysis on Crypto-Currencies Based on Blockchain","confLoc":"Jammu, India","sourcePdf":"6361a069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05968S","chronDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8519644","isNumber":"8520293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8519644","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8520293","articleId":"8520314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8520322,"authors":[{"name":"Swati Rawat","affiliation":["Dept. of computer science Kanya Gurukul MahaVidyalaya, Second campus of Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar, India"],"firstName":"Swati","lastName":"Rawat","id":"37086521363"},{"name":"Praveena Chaturvedi","affiliation":["Dept. of computer science Kanya Gurukul MahaVidyalaya, Second campus of Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar, India"],"firstName":"Praveena","lastName":"Chaturvedi","id":"37086522938"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4205-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4206-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8520322","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Resource management","Wireless networks","Bandwidth","OFDM","Delays","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radio networks","radio spectrum management","resource allocation","telecommunication network management","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS strategies","OFDM wireless network","QoS several scheduling","significant key metrics","bandwidth efficiency","power allocation","energy efficiency","throughput optimization","wireless channel","resource allocation schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Networks","Quality of service (Qos)","Throughput","Delay","Jitter","Loss","Scheduling","Resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Data strong networks have appeared as a new call in the field of wireless networks. To facilitate data users with the uprising need of high data transfer rate is a prime concern to the network provider community. Quality of service (Qos) in terms of network is to provide network resources and services to users so that it satisfies their needs and manages the network resources efficiently altogether. In this paper, we have studied different Qos approaches which have been applied in the past for achieving QoS for various kinds of applications. The kind of network we are using for communication changes the QoS dynamics substantially as providing QoS in a wireless network is way more intriguing, for many complexities being involved in a wireless channel. This paper surveys various Qos strategies and methods that have been implemented in past. To achieve QoS several scheduling and resource allocation schemes are devised by researchers as Network resources must be distributed in such a manner that bandwidth, power allocation, energy efficiency, and throughput is optimized. These QoS approaches have been analysed and compared on account of their methodology, advantages and disadvantages. The performance evaluation is done on all the strategies over some significant key metrics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Analysis of Different QOS Strategies in OFDM Wireless Network","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Next Generation Computing and Information Systems (ICNGCIS)","doi":"10.1109/ICNGCIS.2017.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Next Generation Computing and Information Systems (ICNGCIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8519644/8520293/08520322.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNGCIS.2017.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Analysis of Different QOS Strategies in OFDM Wireless Network","conferenceDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520322/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"18245522","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Analysis of Different QOS Strategies in OFDM Wireless Network","confLoc":"Jammu, India","sourcePdf":"6361a116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06692S","chronDate":"11-12 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8519644","isNumber":"8520293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8519644","xplore-issue":"8520293","articleId":"8520322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8520338,"authors":[{"name":"I.

A SAR system, either on an aircraft or on a satellite, allows the acquisition of high-resolution images of a comprehensive area over the flight path. Being an active sensor, it does not have as many restrictions to visibility as optical sensors and can operate even at night. Moreover, considering the wavelength used, images can be collected through clouds or even through treetops. SAR data processing, like other remote sensing processing, is computationally intensive, and platforms like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) [1], [2], [3] and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) [4] are options to increase the computational performance. GPUs implementations are software oriented, thereby, they are simpler to implement, but due to their ample computational resources, their power consumption is high. A FPGA platform allows a customized architecture and its power consumption is lower. However, FPGA implementations require digital design expertise due to its hardware-oriented conception [5] which impact the development time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520554/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18243427","htmlLink":"/document/8520554/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2018","volume":"33","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cost-sensitive FPGA implementation of SAR range-doppler algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-sensitive FPGA implementation of SAR range-doppler algorithm","sourcePdf":"54-68_aesm-33-09-54.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119937S","chronDate":"September  2018","xplore-pub-id":"62","isNumber":"8520541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8520541","articleId":"8520554","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8520620,"authors":[{"name":"Anca D.

Such motion is great in isolation, but collaboration affords a human who is watching the motion and making inferences about it, trying to coordinate with the robot to achieve the task. This paper analyzes the benefit of planning motion that explicitly enables the collaborator's inferences on the success of physical collaboration, as measured by both objective and subjective metrics. Results suggest that legible motion, planned to clearly express the robot's intent, leads to more fluent collaborations than predictable motion, planned to match the collaborator's expectations. Furthermore, purely functional motion can harm coordination, which negatively affects both task efficiency, as well as the participants' perception of the collaboration.","publicationTitle":"2015 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509500/8520618/08520620.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Robot Motion on Human-Robot Collaboration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Robot Motion on Human-Robot Collaboration","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18202296","publicationDate":"March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/8520620/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520620/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 March 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Robot Motion on Human-Robot Collaboration","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"p51-dragan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06605S","chronDate":"2-5 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"8509500","isNumber":"8520618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509500","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8520618","articleId":"8520620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8520627,"authors":[{"name":"Stefanos Nikolaidis","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Stefanos","lastName":"Nikolaidis","id":"37643766400"},{"name":"Ramya Ramakrishnan","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Ramya","lastName":"Ramakrishnan","id":"37086505837"},{"name":"Keren Gu","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Keren","lastName":"Gu","id":"37086502769"},{"name":"Julie Shah","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Shah","id":"38252774900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-2882-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-2882-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2167-2121"}],"articleNumber":"8520627","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Task analysis","Collaboration","Computational modeling","Clustering algorithms","Markov processes","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","human-robot interaction","Markov processes","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human type","human subject experiment","human actions","human user models","joint-action demonstrations","human-robot collaborative tasks","collaborative task","unsupervised learning algorithm","inverse reinforcement learning algorithm","mixed-observability Markov decision process formulation","action sequences","hand-coded reward function","MOMDP formalism"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520627","abstract":"We present a framework for automatically learning human user models from joint-action demonstrations that enables a robot to compute a robust policy for a collaborative task with a human. First, the demonstrated action sequences are clustered into different human types using an unsupervised learning algorithm. A reward function is then learned for each type through the employment of an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. The learned model is then incorporated into a mixed-observability Markov decision process (MOMDP) formulation, wherein the human type is a partially observable variable. With this framework, we can infer online the human type of a new user that was not included in the training set, and can compute a policy for the robot that will be aligned to the preference of this user. In a human subject experiment (n=30), participants agreed more strongly that the robot anticipated their actions when working with a robot incorporating the proposed framework (p<;0.01), compared to manually annotating robot actions. In trials where participants faced difficulty annotating the robot actions to complete the task, the proposed framework significantly improved team efficiency (p <;0.01). The robot incorporating the framework was also found to be more responsive to human actions compared to policies computed using a hand-coded reward function by a domain expert (p<;0.01). These results indicate that learning human user models from joint-action demonstrations and encoding them in a MOMDP formalism can support effective teaming in human-robot collaborative tasks.","publicationTitle":"2015 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509500/8520618/08520627.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Model Learning from Joint-Action Demonstrations for Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Model Learning from Joint-Action Demonstrations for Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18202308","publicationDate":"March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/8520627/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520627/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 March 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Model Learning from Joint-Action Demonstrations for Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"p189-nikolaidis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055595S","chronDate":"2-5 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"8509500","isNumber":"8520618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509500","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8520618","articleId":"8520627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":8520710,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We assume that some distributions in the set are unknown, and instead, only training sequences generated by the corresponding distributions are available. For both problems, we construct the generalized likelihood tests and characterize the error exponents of the maximum error probabilities. For the existence problem, we show that the error exponent is mainly captured by the Chernoff information between the set of composite distributions and alternative distributions. For the association problem, we show that the error exponent is captured by the minimum Chernoff information between each pair of distributions as well as the Kullback-Leibler Divergences between the approximated distributions (via training sequences) and the true distributions. We also show that the ratio between the lengths of training and testing sequences plays an important role in determining the error decay rate.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2875392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2875392","startPage":"6377","endPage":"6389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8519803/08520733.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8519803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Nonparametric Existence and Association Problems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/8519803/8520733-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Nonparametric Existence and Association Problems","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2018","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2018","volume":"66","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520733/","accessionNumber":"18213536","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520733/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011332","fundingName":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"UCAS[2015]37"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"HR0011-16-C-0135"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1818904 and CCF-1801855"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017ZT07X152"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"DMS-1622433, AST-1547436, ECCS-1659025 and NSFC-61629101"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Fundamental Research Fund","grantNumber":"KQTD2015033114415450 and ZDSYS201707251409055"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Data-Driven Nonparametric Existence and Association Problems","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2875392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131328S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8519803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"8519803","articleId":"8520733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8520746,"authors":[{"name":"Jiejiao Tian","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Networking and Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8584171/8520746/tian-2879370-small.gif","p":["Jiejiao Tian received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2016.

In this paper, a modulation-constrained (MC) clustering classifier is proposed for recognizing the modulation scheme with unknown channel matrix and noise variance for MIMO systems. By recognizing the fact that the received signals within an observation interval form into clusters and exploiting the intrinsic relationships between different digital modulation schemes, the modulation classification is transformed into a number of clustering problems, one for each modulation scheme, with the final classification decision based on the maximum likelihood criterion. To improve the learning efficiency, centroid reconstruction is proposed to recover all cluster centroids through a limited number of parameters by exploiting the structural relationships in constellation diagrams. Furthermore, a method to initialize the cluster centroids is also proposed. The proposed MC classifier together with centroid reconstruction and initialization methods not only reduce the number of parameters to be estimated, but also help to initialize the clustering algorithm for the enhanced convergence performance. Simulation results show that our algorithm can perform excellently even at low SNR and with very short observation interval length.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2018.2879370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8584171/08520746.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2018.2879370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation-Constrained Clustering Approach to Blind Modulation Classification for MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Modulation-Constrained Clustering Approach to Blind Modulation Classification for MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520746/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520746/","volume":"4","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571100, 61631005 and 61628103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation-Constrained Clustering Approach to Blind Modulation Classification for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tccn-liang-2879370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12195S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8584171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8584171","articleId":"8520746","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8520747,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Masunaga","affiliation":["Center Technology Innovation\u2013Electronics, Research and Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd., Kokubunji-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Masunaga","orcid":"0000-0003-1464-8193","id":"37086554596"},{"name":"Shintaroh Sato","affiliation":["Center Technology Innovation\u2013Electronics, Research and Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd., Kokubunji-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shintaroh","lastName":"Sato","orcid":"0000-0003-1789-1578","id":"37085589397"},{"name":"Akio Shima","affiliation":["Center Technology Innovation\u2013Electronics, Research and Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd., Kokubunji-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Akio","lastName":"Shima","orcid":"0000-0001-7202-523X","id":"37265122700"},{"name":"Ryo Kuwana","affiliation":["Center Technology Innovation\u2013Electronics, Research and Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Kuwana","id":"37086559573"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"8520747","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation effects","Logic gates","Silicon","Silicon carbide","Resistance","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","elemental semiconductors","gamma-ray effects","MOSFET","operational amplifiers","silicon","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold voltage degradation","p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors","MOSFET","operational amplifiers","CMOS","complementary MOS","bipolar junction transistors","radiation resistance","nuclear power plants","operational amplifier","gamma irradiation resistance","isolation structure","isolation layer","field plate electrodes","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog circuit","complementary MOS (CMOS)","gamma ray","harsh environment","operational amplifier (op-amp)","radiation resistance","silicon carbide","total ionizing dose (TID)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520747","abstract":"The operational amplifier was fabricated by 4H-SiC complementary MOS on the same die for sensors installed in nuclear power plants, and it showed over 100\u00d7 the radiation resistance compared with Si bipolar junction transistors.

Optimal control methods accounting for inherent uncertainties are needed to facilitate economic and reliable operation of active distribution networks. This paper proposes a stochastic receding horizon control method based on modified stochastic model predictive control framework to integrate high penetration of distributed generation. Multiple controllable resources are jointly optimized over a finite prediction horizon while ensuring relevant security restrictions. The simplified Z-bus sensitivity for active distribution networks is developed for computationally efficient estimation of system nonlinearity with high accuracy, and is combined with the sequential linear programming to iteratively derive the linear state space model for compensation of cumulative modeling errors. Furthermore, the voltage limitations are reformulated as chance constraints to indicate the probabilistic reliability index of voltage qualification rate, and achieve tradeoffs between cost reduction and voltage regulation. The affine-disturbance feedback control policy is leveraged here to enforce close-loop control performance and analytically transform intractable chance constraints into second-order cone constraints. Comprehensive case studies based on 33-bus and 123-bus distribution systems are carried out to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of modeling accuracy, control performance, cost reduction, and method scalability. The proposed approach can effectively enforce voltage regulation against uncertainties with the prescribed probability level. Control costs and constraint violation can be reduced compared with deterministic model predictive control and open-loop control strategies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520753/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","volume":"34","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18470811","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8520753/","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Receding Horizon Control of Active Distribution Networks With Distributed Renewables","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB0905000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51877189 and 51761135015"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2018QNA4015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004835","fundingName":"Zhejiang University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Receding Horizon Control of Active Distribution Networks With Distributed Renewables","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wan-2879451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159359S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8643660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8643660","articleId":"8520753","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":8520755,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Zheng Hui Ernest","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8612978/8520755/ernes-2878889-small.gif","p":["Tan Zheng Hui Ernest received the B.Eng.

Through extensive outage probability and finite signal-to-noise-ratio diversity gain analysis, we showed that the performance of JD is independent of the strength and the data rate of the inter-UAV interference signal. On the contrary, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector requires the data rate of the interfering UAV to be less than the ground station before meaningful performance can be seen. At the system level, it is observed that the half-duplex UAV communication system outperforms the HBD-UCS with JD at moderate and high SNR regimes, as the latter is constrained by self-interference at the full-duplex ground station. Finally, we investigated the multiplexing gain region and showed that the joint detector offers higher diversity gain over a wide range of multiplexing gains over the interference ignorant and the SIC detector.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2878889","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8612978/08520755.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2878889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid-Duplex System With Joint Detection for Interference-Limited UAV Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid-Duplex System With Joint Detection for Interference-Limited UAV Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520755/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18409559","htmlLink":"/document/8520755/","volume":"68","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Airbus Singapore Pte Ltd. and in part by the Singapore Economic Development Board"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid-Duplex System With Joint Detection for Interference-Limited UAV Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhenghuiernest-2878889-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145945S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8612978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8612978","articleId":"8520755","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8520760,"authors":[{"name":"Can Taylan Sari","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Can Taylan","lastName":"Sari","orcid":"0000-0001-6140-3717","id":"37086827649"},{"name":"Cigdem Gunduz-Demir","affiliation":["Neuroscience Graduate Program, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cigdem","lastName":"Gunduz-Demir","orcid":"0000-0003-0724-1942","id":"38320766800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"8520760","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1711},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Cancer","Task analysis","Pathology","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","biological organs","biological tissues","biomedical optical imaging","Boltzmann machines","cancer","feature extraction","image classification","image representation","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microscopic colon tissue images","histopathological image analysis","restricted Boltzmann machines","deep belief network","image representation","image data","deep learning-based technique","image locations","domain-specific prior knowledge","unsupervised feature extractor","histopathology domain","digitized histopathological tissue images","computerized methods","digital pathology","cancer diagnosis","histopathological examination","histopathological classification","unsupervised feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","feature learning","histopathological image representation","digital pathology","automated cancer diagnosis","saliency","colon cancer","hematoxylin-eosin staining"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Colon","Deep Learning","Histocytochemistry","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Unsupervised Machine Learning"]}],"abstract":"Histopathological examination is today's gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However, this task is time consuming and prone to errors as it requires a detailed visual inspection and interpretation of a pathologist. Digital pathology aims at alleviating these problems by providing computerized methods that quantitatively analyze digitized histopathological tissue images. The performance of these methods mainly relies on the features that they use, and thus, their success strictly depends on the ability of these features by successfully quantifying the histopathology domain. With this motivation, this paper presents a new unsupervised feature extractor for effective representation and classification of histopathological tissue images. This feature extractor has three main contributions: First, it proposes to identify salient subregions in an image, based on domain-specific prior knowledge, and to quantify the image by employing only the characteristics of these subregions instead of considering the characteristics of all image locations. Second, it introduces a new deep learning-based technique that quantizes the salient subregions by extracting a set of features directly learned on image data and uses the distribution of these quantizations for image representation and classification. To this end, the proposed deep learning-based technique constructs a deep belief network of the restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), defines the activation values of the hidden unit nodes in the final RBM as the features, and learns the quantizations by clustering these features in an unsupervised way. Third, this extractor is the first example for successfully using the restricted Boltzmann machines in the domain of histopathological image analysis. Our experiments on microscopic colon tissue images reveal that the proposed feature extractor is effective to obtain more accurate classification results compared to its counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2018.2879369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8704227/08520760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2879369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8704227","startPage":"1139","endPage":"1149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Feature Extraction via Deep Learning for Histopathological Classification of Colon Tissue Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Feature Extraction via Deep Learning for Histopathological Classification of Colon Tissue Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18635999","pubMedId":"30403624","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8520760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004410","fundingName":"T\u00fcrkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Ara\u015ftirma Kurumu","grantNumber":"T\u00dcB\u0130TAK 116E075"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004412","fundingName":"T\u00fcrkiye Bilimler Akademisi","grantNumber":"T\u00dcBA GEB\u0130P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Feature Extraction via Deep Learning for Histopathological Classification of Colon Tissue Images","sourcePdf":"tmi-gunduzdemir-2879369-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088161S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8704227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8704227","articleId":"8520760","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8520764,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Liu","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8721605/8520764/liu-2879340-small.gif","p":["Jia Liu (S\u201915\u2013M\u201917) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, the Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur degree from the University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes, France, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 2016.","He was with Delta Electronics (Jiangsu), Ltd., Nanjing, China, from 2011 to 2012.

The ideal solution is to assure the best power quality at the common bus to which loads are connected, and share the negative and harmonic sequence currents between the inverters without any communication. However, it is difficult to achieve this objective with existing virtual-impedance-based methods when nonlinearities of inverters, e.g., dead time, are not negligible. In this paper, a novel cost-function-based method is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed cost functions are optimized using continuous-control-set model predictive control. As unknown nonlinearities of inverters can be observed by introducing disturbance models, even when they are not negligible, the presented method can compensate bus voltage unbalance and harmonics and share the compensated current between inverters autonomously, with neither communication nor upper level controller. Parameter tuning of the proposed method is the key to achieve the balance between bus voltage quality and current sharing, and between stability and fast response. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme is effective even under conditions of large inverter nonlinearities.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2018.2879340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2018.2879340","startPage":"7397","endPage":"7410","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8721605/08520764.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8721605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Function-Based Microgrid Decentralized Control of Unbalance and Harmonics for Simultaneous Bus Voltage Compensation and Current Sharing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Function-Based Microgrid Decentralized Control of Unbalance and Harmonics for Simultaneous Bus Voltage Compensation and Current Sharing","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2019","volume":"34","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520764/","accessionNumber":"18708244","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520764/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Function-Based Microgrid Decentralized Control of Unbalance and Harmonics for Simultaneous Bus Voltage Compensation and Current Sharing","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2879340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110135S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8721605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8721605","articleId":"8520764","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":8520768,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Medra","affiliation":["The Edward S.

The constraint of having the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) satisfy a given threshold with high probability is intractable in general, which results in problems that are fundamentally hard to solve. We develop a high-quality approximation of the SINR outage constraint that, along with a semidefinite relaxation, enables us to formulate the robust beamformer design problem for Gaussian channel estimation errors as a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. For systems with small uncertainties, further approximations yield design algorithms based on iterative evaluations of closed-form expressions that have substantially lower computational cost. Since finding the beamforming directions incurs most of that cost, analogous power loading algorithms for predefined beamforming directions are developed and their performance is shown to be close to optimal. When the system contains a large number of antennas, the proposed power loading can be obtained at a computational cost that grows only linearly in the number of antennas. The proposed power loading algorithm provides an explicit relationship between the outage probability required and the power consumed, which allows us to precisely control the power consumption, and automatically identifies users who are consuming most of the power resources. The flexibility of the proposed approach is illustrated by developing a power loading technique that minimizes an average notion of outage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2019","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18281635","htmlLink":"/document/8520768/","displayDocTitle":"Offset-Based Beamforming: A New Approach to Robust Downlink Transmission","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2015-06631"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11871168"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offset-Based Beamforming: A New Approach to Robust Downlink Transmission","sourcePdf":"tsp-medra-2879049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157089S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8541135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8541135","articleId":"8520768","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8520774,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad A.

The likelihood ratio test under Neyman-Pearson sense is used to derive the optimal DF rule (DFR). Moreover, three suboptimal fusion rules are derived to enable a broad range of complexity-performance tradeoffs. The performance of the optimal and suboptimal fusion schemes is evaluated in terms of probability of detection, false alarm, and fusion decision error where analytical expressions are derived for the suboptimal schemes, while Monte Carlo simulation is used for the optimal DFR. The obtained analytical and simulation results show that the decision error performance of the network is mainly determined by the number and accuracy of the local sensors, while the relaying process could be effective in mitigating the fading channel effects.

As the durations of the short utterances are small (e.g., less than 3 s), it is difficult to learn sufficient information to distinguish the type of languages. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end short utterances based speech language identification (SLI) approach, which is especially suitable for the short utterance based language identification. This approach is implemented with a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, which is designed for the SLI application in intelligent vehicles. The features used for LSTM learning are generated by a transfer learning method. The bottleneck features of a deep neural network, which are obtained for a mandarin acoustic-phonetic classifier, are used for the LSTM training. In order to improve the SLD accuracy with short utterances, a phase vocoder based time-scale modification method is utilized to reduce/increase the speech rate of the test utterance. By connecting the normal, speech rate reduced, and speech rate increased utterances, we can extend the length of the test utterances such that the performance of the SLI system is improved. The experimental results on the AP17-OLR database demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the performance of SLD, especially on short utterance. The proposed SLI has robust performance under the vehicular noisy environment.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2879361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2879361","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

Field recovery not only increases the degree of freedom for optical modulations, but also enables the digital compensation of fiber dispersion that avoids the sophisticated optical dispersion management. Compared with coherent detection, direct detection (DD) owns a natural advantage-the simplicity, but lacks the capability of field recovery. To increase the modulation dimension for DD, the recent development of Stokes vector receiver takes the advantage of polarization diversity and extends the modulation dimension up to three-dimension with reference to the four-dimensional coherent detection (i.e., dual-polarization intensity and phase). However, a Stokes vector receiver is not inherently capable of field recovery because the second-order signal representation in Stokes space nonlinearizes the first-order linear field information, making it infeasible to digitally compensate the chromatic dispersion. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of Stokes-space field recovery (SSFR) that completely or partially recovers the optical field by DD. We analyze the degree of freedom for a variety of Stokes-space modulations compatible with SSFR, and reveal their tradeoff between optical spectral efficiency (that determines fiber capacity) and electrical spectral efficiency (that determines transceiver cost per bit). We review the Stokes-space polarization recovery methods and generalize a novel concept as analog polarization identification to simplify the DSP of SSFR. Furthermore, we compare the OSNR sensitivity among various common direct detection schemes to provide reliable predictions of their transmission performance. With its high spectral efficiency and capability of digital dispersion compensation, SSFR is very promising for future high-capacity short-reach applications over single- or multispan fiber transmission.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2879181","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

wave communication for connecting low power, miniaturized wearable, and implantable devices in, on, and around the human body. HBC uses the human body as the communication channel between on-body devices. Previous studies characterizing the human body channel has reported widely varying channel response much of which has been attributed to the variation in measurement setup. This calls for the development of a unifying bio-physical model of HBC, supported by in-depth analysis and an understanding of the effect of excitation, termination modality on HBC measurements. This paper characterizes the human body channel up to 1 MHz frequency to evaluate it as a medium for the broadband communication. The communication occurs primarily in the electro-quasistatic (EQS) regime at these frequencies through the subcutaneous tissues. A lumped bio-physical model of HBC is developed, supported by experimental validations that provide insight into some of the key discrepancies found in previous studies. Voltage loss measurements are carried out both with an oscilloscope and a miniaturized wearable prototype to capture the effects of non-common ground. Results show that the channel loss is strongly dependent on the termination impedance at the receiver end, with up to 4 dB variation in average loss for different termination in an oscilloscope and an additional 9 dB channel loss with wearable prototype compared to an oscilloscope measurement. The measured channel response with capacitive termination reduces low-frequency loss and allows flat-band transfer function down to 13 KHz, establishing the human body as a broadband communication channel. Analysis of the measured results and the simulation model shows that instruments with 50 \u03a9 input impedance (Vector Network Analyzer, Spectrum Analyzer) provides pessimistic estimation of channel loss at low frequencies. Instead, high impedance and capacitive termination should be used at the receiver end for accurate voltage mode loss measurements of the HBC channel at low frequencies. The experimentally validated bio-physical model shows that capacitive voltage mode termination can improve the low frequency loss by up to 50 dB, which helps broadband communication significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2018.2879462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8718429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2018.2879462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8718429/08520787.pdf","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-Physical Modeling, Characterization, and Optimization of Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/8718429/8520787-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Bio-Physical Modeling, Characterization, and Optimization of Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication","volume":"66","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520787/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18672845","pubMedId":"30403618","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520787/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-17-1-0450"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS 1657455"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Bio-Physical Modeling, Characterization, and Optimization of Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication","sourcePdf":"tbme-maity-2879462-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1019S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8718429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8718429","articleId":"8520787","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8520788,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Wen","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8520788/wen-2879334-small.gif","p":["Zhigang Wen received the Ph.D. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), China, in 2009.

In this paper, we propose a multiple-input multiple-output full-duplex (FD) relay-based SWIPT-MEC system. With MEC and SWIPT, UE can use its battery energy to execute a computation task locally or offload part or all of it to access point connected with an MEC server and refill battery while receiving the computation results. The FD mode allows relay to receive and transmit the offloaded bits simultaneously. Based on these, an energy-efficient problem is formulated to minimize the system energy consumption over a time block, while the latency constraints and the energy consumption constraints are guaranteed. Since the original problem is non-convex, we use an alternating optimization technique to convert the original problem into three subproblems. Some propositions and algorithms are proposed to solve these three subproblems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed optimization scheme achieves a significant performance gain by comparisons with three benchmark schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

The present work proposes a driver drowsiness detection algorithm based on heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and validates the proposed method by comparing with electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep scoring. Methods: Changes in sleep condition affect the autonomic nervous system and then HRV, which is defined as an RR interval (RRI) fluctuation on an electrocardiogram trace. Eight HRV features are monitored for detecting changes in HRV by using multivariate statistical process control, which is a well known anomaly detection method. Result: The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated through an experiment using a driving simulator. In this experiment, RRI data were measured from 34 participants during driving, and their sleep onsets were determined based on the EEG data by a sleep specialist. The validation result of the experimental data with the EEG data showed that drowsiness was detected in 12 out of 13 pre-N1 episodes prior to the sleep onsets, and the false positive rate was 1.7 times per hour. Conclusion: The present work also demonstrates the usefulness of the framework of HRV-based anomaly detection that was originally proposed for epileptic seizure prediction. Significance: The proposed method can contribute to preventing accidents caused by drowsy driving.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2018.2879346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8718429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2018.2879346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8718429/08520803.pdf","startPage":"1769","endPage":"1778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heart Rate Variability-Based Driver Drowsiness Detection and Its Validation With EEG","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Heart Rate Variability-Based Driver Drowsiness Detection and Its Validation With EEG","volume":"66","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520803/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18672831","pubMedId":"30403616","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520803/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JST A-STEP","grantNumber":"12103409"},{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"17H00872"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Heart Rate Variability-Based Driver Drowsiness Detection and Its Validation With EEG","sourcePdf":"tbme-fujiwara-2879346-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15478S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8718429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8718429","articleId":"8520803","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8520808,"authors":[{"name":"Jihoon Choi","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Korea Aerospace University, Goyang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8520808/choi-2879397-small.gif","p":["Jihoon Choi (S\u201999\u2013M\u201904\u2013SM\u201918) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea, in 1997, 1999, and 2003, respectively.

In this paper, a multiuser IoT network is considered, where an energy-constrained relay assists the information transmission of a number of IoT devices to the access point (AP) using WPC. In particular, the relay acquires the energy needed for information forwarding from the RF energy transfer of the AP, which serves as a dedicated energy transmitter for the relay. The objective is to maximize the total network throughput by jointly optimizing the wireless energy transfer (WET) duration and the relay's energy expenditure in each time slot, subject to the energy causality constraint, for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols. We show that the optimization problems for both the AF- and DF-based systems are convex and thus can be solved using convex optimization techniques. Our analysis shows that the solution of the sum-throughput maximization problems depends on the scheduling order of the IoT devices and the optimal solution is derived for different ordering scenarios. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to corroborate our analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Multiuser Internet of Things Network With Single Wireless-Powered Relay","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2879373","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8709863/08520809.pdf","startPage":"3132","endPage":"3142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2879373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8709863","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520809/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Multiuser Internet of Things Network With Single Wireless-Powered Relay","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8520809/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18653998","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Multiuser Internet of Things Network With Single Wireless-Powered Relay","sourcePdf":"jiot-jamalipour-2879373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074152S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8520809","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8520833,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongqiang Luo","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8520833/luo-2879380-small.gif","p":["Zhongqiang Luo received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in communication engineering and pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2016.

For deeply dissecting and detecting the expected signals, the research community has to investigate the smart signal processing technology to resisting the influence of detrimental signals. For this purpose, blind source separation has been shown to be a promising method for achieving simultaneous spectrum utilization and wireless adaptive interference cancellation. The attractive features and appealing advantages of blind source separation make it an attractive theory for source extraction or recovery, which plays a crucial role in helping realize intelligent signal processing for wireless communication. It can recover the unobserved sources only from the wireless received mixed signals based on the features of the source signal exempted from channel estimation and synchronization manipulation. Wireless communication systems can benefit the high spectrum efficiency, strong anti-interference, and adaptive signal processing through the blind separation mechanism. So far, numerous researchers have made tremendous efforts to investigate this field for enhancing spectrum efficiency, anti-interference ability, and signal detection performance through employing the philosophy of blind separation. These meaningful and appealing research works motivate us to make a comprehensive survey with regard to this area. In this paper, the fundamental principle of the blind separation mechanism, involving independent component analysis, sparse component analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, and bounded component analysis will be reviewed briefly, and then, the critical technologies applied in various wireless communication systems will be overviewed, such as in direct-sequence code division multiplexing access, frequency hopping, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, multiple input multiple output, wireless sensor networks, cognitive radio networks, radio frequency identification devices, and communication security.

Traditional knowledge-based systems are unable to meet the current production management requirements of precision picking, because they are time-consuming and have low accuracy. Our research proposes an improved deep learning-based classification method that improves the accuracy and scalability of tomato ripeness with a small amount of training data. This study was on the relationship between different dataset augmentation methods and prediction results of final classification task. We implemented classification systems based on convolutional neural network (CNN), by training and validating the model on different augmented datasets and tried to choose an optimal augmentation method for datasets. The experimental results showed an average accuracy of 91.9% with a less than 0.01-s prediction time. Compared to the existing methods, our solution achieved better prediction results both in terms of accuracy and time consumption. Moreover, this is a versatile method and can be extended to other related fields.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08520836.pdf","startPage":"67940","endPage":"67950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Improved Classification System for Designing Tomato Harvesting Robot","topic":"AI-Driven Big Data Processing: Theory, Methodology, and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Improved Classification System for Designing Tomato Harvesting Robot","volume":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520836/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495718","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520836/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002338","fundingName":"Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China","grantNumber":"2017PT19"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018M630222"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning Based Improved Classification System for Designing Tomato Harvesting Robot","sourcePdf":"access-gao-2879324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120188S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["AI-Driven Big Data Processing: Theory, Methodology, and Applications"],"articleId":"8520836","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8520837,"authors":[{"name":"Li You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8520837/you-2879366-small.gif","p":["Li You (S\u201913\u2013M\u201917) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, in 2016, all in electrical engineering.","From 2014 to 2015, he conducted visiting research at the Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.

We first show the closed-form eigenvectors of the optimal unicast and multicast transmit covariance matrices, respectively, which reveals the optimality of beam domain transmission and simplifies the large-dimensional matrix-valued NOUM transmission design into a beam domain power allocation problem. Via invoking the concave-convex procedure, we, then, propose an efficient iterative beam domain power allocation algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary point.

In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithm using two-archive and recombination strategies. In the proposed algorithm, the properties of decision variables and the relationships among them are analyzed at first to guide the evolutionary search. Then, a general framework using two archives, i.e., the convergence and the diversity archives, is adopted to cooperatively solve these problems. Moreover, the diversity archive simultaneously employs a clustering strategy to guarantee diversity in the objective space and a niche-based clearing strategy to promote the same in the decision space. At the end of evolution process, solutions in the convergence and the diversity archives are recombined to obtain a large number of multiple Pareto optimal solutions. In addition, a set of benchmark test functions and a performance metric are designed for multimodal multiobjective optimization. The proposed algorithm is empirically compared with two state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms on these test functions. The comparative results demonstrate that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm is significantly superior to the competing algorithms.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/8781948/08520873.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multimodal Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Using Two-Archive and Recombination Strategies","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2018.2879406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8781948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2018.2879406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Multimodal Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Using Two-Archive and Recombination Strategies","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18867456","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8520873/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61803192, 61876075, 61773384, 61763026, 61673404, 61573361 and 61503220"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB046306-2"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1003802-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201606420005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multimodal Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Using Two-Archive and Recombination Strategies","sourcePdf":"tevc-yen-2879406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130106S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8781948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8781948","articleId":"8520873","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8520876,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/8540961/8520876/wu-2876355-small.gif","p":["Tong Wu received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2016.

In this paper, the scaling behaviors and variability issues are explored by numerical device simulations of a model silicon quantum gate based on the detuning mechanism. The device physics of quantum gates modulation, tradeoff between device speed and quantum fidelity, and impact of variability on the implementation of a quantum algorithm are examined. The results indicate the attractive potential to achieve high speed and fidelity silicon quantum gates with a low operation voltage. To scale up, reducing the device variability and mitigating the variability effect are identified to be indispensable for reliable implementing a quantum computing algorithm with the silicon quantum gates based on the detuning mechanism.

A compact impedance inverter and output matching of the DPA are achieved using a transmission line network and shunt capacitors. Also, the size ratio of power cells in the main and auxiliary amplifiers is optimized for a high efficiency at output power backoff (OPBO). The measured peak output power (Pout) and the 1-dB compression point (P1 dB) are 38.7 and 32.1 dBm, respectively, at 5.9 GHz. The power-added efficiency at 6-dB OPBO is up to 49.5%. Without digital predistortion (DPD), the DPA can deliver an average Pout of 23.5 dBm with error vector magnitude (EVM) <;-28 dB and 21.5 dBm with EVM <;-32 dB for 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 256-QAM signals, respectively. The measured X-parameters are employed to further investigate the DPA nonlinear characteristics and verify the accuracy of conventionally used power amplifier characterization/measurement methods for system-level design and testing applications. The simulated results based on the X-parameters also indicate that the average output power can be enhanced up to 25.7 dBm with DPD for 256-QAM.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2876255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2876255","startPage":"5676","endPage":"5684","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8572808/08520877.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8572808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Compact GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifier and System Level Analysis With X-Parameters for 5G Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Compact GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifier and System Level Analysis With X-Parameters for 5G Communications","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2018","volume":"66","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520877/","accessionNumber":"18325140","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520877/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 106-2221-E-007-103-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Compact GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifier and System Level Analysis With X-Parameters for 5G Communications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-hsu-2876255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07383S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8572808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8572808","articleId":"8520877","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":8520878,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-6834-6268","id":"37085407009"},{"name":"Yesheng Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yesheng","lastName":"Gao","orcid":"0000-0002-6254-886X","id":"37404895300"},{"name":"Fang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086238736"},{"name":"Xingzhao Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xingzhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086174061"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"8520878","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Laser beams","Optical beams","Real-time systems","Phased arrays","High-speed optical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","FIR filters","phase control","phased array radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phased array radar beamforming","antenna arrays","multiple beams","real-time processing","huge data amount","electronic mass data","speed limitations","optronic technique","real-time multibeam optronic beamforming system","system design","radar raw data","weighting coefficients","laser beam","data capacity","low-power optronic beamformer","controllable multibeams","OPBF system","JAPC module","finite-impulse response filtering process","real-time optronic beamformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude modulation","beamforming","digital micromirror device (DMD)","optronic processing","phase modulation","real-time processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520878","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2018.2875461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","abstract":"The development of phased array radar beamforming technologies has led to an ever-increasing demand for large antenna arrays and multiple beams. However, real-time processing becomes a difficulty for large array or multibeam beamforming due to huge data amount. To overcome the electronic mass data processing speed limitations, optronic technique is developed for beamforming in this letter. We present a novel real-time multibeam optronic beamforming (OPBF) system specially designed for large phased array. In our system design, beamforming is formulated as a finite-impulse response filtering process, of which radar raw data and weighting coefficients are encoded onto the laser beam by joint amplitude and phase control (JAPC) modules and two-dimension adding is performed by a lens. Ultrafast optical calculation and the proposed high-speed JAPC module make the system powerful for real-time processing. The proposed system has good expansibility in data capacity, which makes it applicable to massive data processing. What's more, a practical low-power optronic beamformer is demonstrated. Measured results show that the presented OPBF system is able to accurately synthesize flexible and controllable multibeams and performs well in channel equalization.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2018.2875461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8653434","startPage":"387","endPage":"391","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/8653434/08520878.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Optronic Beamformer on Receive in Phased Array Radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8520878/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Optronic Beamformer on Receive in Phased Array Radar","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18489571","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"3","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601285"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Optronic Beamformer on Receive in Phased Array Radar","sourcePdf":"lgrs-gao-2875461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055303S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8653434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8653434","articleId":"8520878","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8520888,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Guo","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ningbo University, Ningbo"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086426976"},{"name":"Ming Jin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ningbo University, Ningbo"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Jin","orcid":"0000-0002-9824-7647","id":"37898570200"},{"name":"Qinghua Guo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0002-5180-7854","id":"37273105900"},{"name":"Youming Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ningbo University, Ningbo"],"firstName":"Youming","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-9497-6762","id":"37899077300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8520888","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520888","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrices","Complexity theory","Numerical simulation","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antieigenvalue-based spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","theoretical expression","decision threshold","mean-to-square extreme eigenvalue detector","theoretical analysis","antieigenvalue-based detector","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","sample covariance matrix"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LWC.2018.2879339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8685245/08520888.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2018.2879339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8685245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antieigenvalue-Based Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the application of antieigenvalues to spectrum sensing for the first time and design an antieigenvalue-based detector.

Prior work in the area of approximate computing has focused on individual subsystems of a computing system, for example, the computational subsystem or the memory subsystem. Since they focus only on individual subsystems, these techniques are unable to exploit the large energy-saving opportunities that stem from adopting a full-system perspective and approximating multiple subsystems of a computing platform simultaneously in a coordinated manner. This paper proposes a systematic methodology to perform joint approximations across different subsystems, leading to significant energy benefits compared to approximating individual subsystems in isolation. We use the example of a smart camera system that executes various computer vision and image processing applications to illustrate how the sensing, memory, processing, and communication subsystems can all be approximated synergistically. We demonstrate our proposed methodology using two variants of a smart camera system: 1) a compute-intensive smart camera system, AxSYScomp, where the error-resilient application executes locally within the camera and produces the final application output, and 2) a communication-intensive smart camera system, AxSYScomp, that sends the captured image to a remote cloud server, where the error-resilient application is executed and the final output is generated. We have implemented such an approximate smart camera system using an Altera Stratix IV GX FPGA development board, a Terasic TRDB-D5M 5-Megapixel camera module, a Terasic RFS WiFi module, and a 1-GB DDR3 dynamic random access memory small outline dual in-line memory module (SODIMM). Experimental results obtained using six application benchmarks demonstrate significant energy savings (around 7.5x for AxSYScomp and 4x on average for AxSYScomp) for minimal (<;1%) loss in application quality. Compared to approximating a single subsystem, the proposed full-system approximation methodology achieves additional energy benefits of 3.5x-5.5x (in the case of AxSYScomp) and 1.8x-3.7x (in the case of AxSYScomm) on average for a minimal (<;1%) application-level quality loss.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2864269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8554317/08520898.pdf","startPage":"2884","endPage":"2897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8554317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2864269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximating Beyond the Processor: Exploring Full-System Energy-Accuracy Tradeoffs in a Smart Camera System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Approximating Beyond the Processor: Exploring Full-System Energy-Accuracy Tradeoffs in a Smart Camera System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520898/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18285580","htmlLink":"/document/8520898/","volume":"26","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"2016-SD-2723"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximating Beyond the Processor: Exploring Full-System Energy-Accuracy Tradeoffs in a Smart Camera System","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-raha-2864269-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137641S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8554317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8554317","articleId":"8520898","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8520899,"authors":[{"name":"Antonia Creswell","affiliation":["BICV, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8738884/8520899/cresw-2875194-small.gif","p":["Antonia Creswell recieved the M.Eng. degree in biomedical engineering from the Imperial College London, London, U.K., where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","She has been an Intern with Magic Pony, Twitter, U.K., and DeepMind, Google, U.K."]},"firstName":"Antonia","lastName":"Creswell","orcid":"0000-0003-1037-9395","id":"37086798257"},{"name":"Anil Anthony Bharath","affiliation":["BICV, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8738884/8520899/bhara-2875194-small.gif","p":["Anil Anthony Bharath received the B.Eng. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from the University College London, London, U.K., in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the Imperial College London, London, in 1993.","He was an Academic Visitor with the Signal Processing Group, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., in 2006.

As a result, very high resolution images are available for interpretation of the urban area. Buildings are one of the most important parts of the urban area. In this paper, we propose a novel method for building detection from SAR images. First, a set of primary detections, using double bounce, layover, and shadow features, are made. These features are extracted using the order statistics constant false alarm rate method and power ratio detector. The detectors parameters are adjusted in such a way that all bright and dark areas are well extracted. Second, the K-singular value decomposition method is used to learn two dictionaries for discrimination of buildings from clutters. The main idea is to utilize recognition techniques in detection algorithms in order to reduce the number of the false alarms. Gray level statistical, textural, and shape features are used to form the dictionaries. In this step, a secondary set of detections are available, and the final detections are made by the fusion of these two sets. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated by two different TerraSAR-X images from a densely built-up area. The results show that the proposed method is an effective way to detect building through single SAR images.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2876910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2876910","startPage":"4808","endPage":"4817","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8602368/08520900.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8602368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building Detection in Very High Resolution SAR Images Via Sparse Representation Over Learned Dictionaries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Building Detection in Very High Resolution SAR Images Via Sparse Representation Over Learned Dictionaries","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","volume":"11","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520900/","accessionNumber":"18400937","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520900/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building Detection in Very High Resolution SAR Images Via Sparse Representation Over Learned Dictionaries","sourcePdf":"jstars-ghassemian-2876910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128529S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8602368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8602368","articleId":"8520900","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8520902,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Deng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8651575/8520902/deng-2868851-small.gif","p":["Cheng Deng (M\u201911) received the B.E., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in signal and information processing from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China.","He is currently a Full Professor with the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University.

However, the construction of an efficient deep neural network mostly relies on a large number of labeled samples being available. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified deep network, combined with active transfer learning (TL) that can be well-trained for HSIs classification using only minimally labeled training data. More specifically, deep joint spectral-spatial feature is first extracted through hierarchical stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) networks. Active TL is then exploited to transfer the pretrained SSAE network and the limited training samples from the source domain to the target domain, where the SSAE network is subsequently fine-tuned using the limited labeled samples selected from both source and target domains by the corresponding active learning (AL) strategies. The advantages of our proposed method are threefold: 1) the network can be effectively trained using only limited labeled samples with the help of novel AL strategies; 2) the network is flexible and scalable enough to function across various transfer situations, including cross data set and intraimage; and 3) the learned deep joint spectral-spatial feature representation is more generic and robust than many joint spectral-spatial feature representations. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and deep network-based methods, on three popular data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2868851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8651575/08520902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2868851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8651575","startPage":"1741","endPage":"1754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Transfer Learning Network: A Unified Deep Joint Spectral\u2013Spatial Feature Learning Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active Transfer Learning Network: A Unified Deep Joint Spectral\u2013Spatial Feature Learning Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18489358","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8520902/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572388 and 61872021"},{"fundingName":"Key R&D Program-The Key Industry Innovation Chain of Shaanxi","grantNumber":"2017ZDCXL-GY-05-04-02"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FL-170100117, DP-180103424 and IH180100002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Transfer Learning Network: A Unified Deep Joint Spectral\u2013Spatial Feature Learning Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tao-2868851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120048S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8651575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8651575","articleId":"8520902","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8520909,"authors":[{"name":"Hen-Geul Yeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California State University, Long Beach, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8811839/8520909/yeh-2874030-small.gif","p":["Hen-Geul Yeh (SM\u201982) received the B.S. degree in engineering science from National Chen Kung University, Taiwan, ROC, in 1978, the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering with the University of California, Irvine, CA, USA, in 1979 and 1982, respectively.","Since 1983, he has been with the Electrical Engineering department at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), USA, and served as the Department Chair since 2016.

In this paper, MIMO space-time-frequency (STF) conjugate two-path transmission orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with precoders are presented to combat inter-carrier interference and to adaptively switch between these two modes in mobile fading channels. First, the STF architecture is developed to form a 2 \u00d7 1 STF-OFDM system. Second, a conjugate cancellation (CC) two-path transmission scheme is integrated with the STF-OFDM system to form a new 2 \u00d7 1 STFCC-OFDM system. This system improves BER without expanding power or bandwidth in comparing with the CC scheme. Third, Walsh-Hadamard (WH) transform is employed as the precoder to form the 2 \u00d7 1 WHSTFCC-OFDM system. Finally, a 2 \u00d7 2 WHSTFCC-OFDM architecture is designed. It can be used to improve BER or switch to two 2 \u00d7 1 WHSTFCC-OFDM systems to increase capacity as needed. Simulations indicate that the 2 \u00d7 1 WHSTFCC-OFDM system has the best BER, the STFCC-OFDM system, and the STF-OFDM system follow in order. Similarly, the BER of the 2 \u00d7 2 WHSTFCC-OFDM system outperforms the 2 \u00d7 1 WHSTFCC-OFDM, and the 2 \u00d7 2 STFCC-OFDM system follow in order. All these STFCC- and WHSTFCC-OFDM schemes are simple and backward compatible with the existing OFDM system. They may serve as baseband building blocks in OFDM transceivers and can be adaptively switched between 2 \u00d7 1 and 2 \u00d7 2 architectures as required for the fourth generation and the future planned fifth generation MIMO systems. This adaptive MIMO system can also be applied to the regular or bad weather environment in the disaster conditions for increasing capacity or enhancing the reliability of the communication system.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2018.2874030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8811839/08520909.pdf","startPage":"2443","endPage":"2453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2018.2874030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8811839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Adaptive MIMO Space-Time-Frequency Conjugate Two-Path OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520909/","displayDocTitle":"Design Adaptive MIMO Space-Time-Frequency Conjugate Two-Path OFDM Systems","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18937358","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520909/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-16-1-2962"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Adaptive MIMO Space-Time-Frequency Conjugate Two-Path OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-yeh-2874030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089618S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8811839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8811839","articleId":"8520909","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8520922,"authors":[{"name":"Yehia Beltagy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Yehia Beltagy (S\u201910\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2014, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2017.","During his master\u2019s studies, he was involved in multiple projects related to transmitter linearization using digital predistortion for fifth-generation applications.

The learning algorithm is complemented with a joint time and phase alignment procedure to compensate for the unknown phase of the IF carrier as well as the delay between the PA input and output signals. By sub-Nyquist sampling at IF, the proposed method avoids the need for challenging receiver calibration that compensates for significant IQ imbalance exhibited by direct conversion receivers. Furthermore, it provides a very attractive flexibility in choosing the IF and consequently allows for a high subsampling factor. It is also extended to account for the nonflat frequency response of the TOR, thus avoiding the need for an explicit calibration step. Finally, measurement results were performed to linearize a PA demonstrator driven by a 320-MHz wide carrier aggregated LTE signal centered at 31 GHz using a complexity reduced Volterra-based DPD. Excellent linearization capacity (ACPR of 50 dBc and normalized mean square error of 2%) using significantly low sampling rates (as low as 40 Msps) is reported.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Training","Receivers","Bandwidth","Demodulation","5G mobile communication","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","distortion","frequency response","learning (artificial intelligence)","linearisation techniques","Long Term Evolution","power amplifiers","radio receivers","radio transmitters","signal sampling","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct learning algorithm","power amplifier","heterodyne transmitter observation receiver","TOR","sub-Nyquist sampling","direct conversion receivers","nonflat frequency response","PA demonstrator","LTE signal","digital predistortion training","sub-Nyquist intermediate frequency feedback signal","Volterra-based DPD","joint time-phase alignment procedure","IQ imbalance","receiver calibration","frequency 31.0 GHz","frequency 320 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion (DPD)","direct learning","mm-wave","power amplifier (PA) linearization","sub-Nyquist","transmitter observation receiver (TOR) calibration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2873331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8602378/08520922.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8602378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2873331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Learning Algorithm for Digital Predistortion Training Using Sub-Nyquist Intermediate Frequency Feedback Signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct Learning Algorithm for Digital Predistortion Training Using Sub-Nyquist Intermediate Frequency Feedback Signal","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520922/","volume":"67","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8520922/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18385026","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Learning Algorithm for Digital Predistortion Training Using Sub-Nyquist Intermediate Frequency Feedback Signal","sourcePdf":"tmtt-beltagy-2873331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132892S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8602378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8602378","articleId":"8520922","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":8520923,"authors":[{"name":"Kohei Oyama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8697166/8520923/oyama-2874049-small.gif","p":["Kohei Oyama received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and information systems.","His research interests include SAR data processing and human computer interaction using cross-modal phenomenon."]},"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Oyama","id":"37086481285"},{"name":"Akira Hirose","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8697166/8520923/hiros-2874049-small.gif","p":["Akira Hirose (F\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1991.","In 1987, he joined Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), the University of Tokyo, as Research Associate, where he became an Instructor in 1991.

This paper proposes a filtering method to compensate SPs adaptively by using polarization and phase information around the SPs. Phase value is essentially related to polarization changes in scattering as well as propagation. In order to handle the polarization and phase information simultaneously in a consistent manner, we define a new number, phasor quaternion (PQ), by combining quaternion and complex amplitude, with which we construct the theory of PQ neural networks (PQNNs). Experiments demonstrate that the proposed PQNN filter compensates SPs very effectively. Even in the situations where the conventional methods deteriorate in their performance, it realizes accurate compensation, thanks to its good generalization characteristics in integrated Poincare-sphere polarization space and the complex-amplitude space. We find that PQNN is an excellent framework to deal with the polarization and phase of electromagnetic wave adaptively and consistently.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18617330","volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8520923/","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Phasor Quaternion Neural Networks for Singular Point Compensation in Polarimetric-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"15H02756 and 18H04105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011923","fundingName":"KDDI Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phasor Quaternion Neural Networks for Singular Point Compensation in Polarimetric-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar","sourcePdf":"tgrs-hirose-2874049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136224S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8697166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8697166","articleId":"8520923","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":8520925,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Makki","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8605558/8520925/makki-2878252-small.gif","p":["Behrooz Makki received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in bioelectric engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, and the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Considering continuous and bursty communication scenarios with different users' data request probabilities, we derive quasi-closed-form expressions for the maximum achievable throughput of the networks using optimal schedulers. The results are obtained in various cases with different levels of interference cancellation. Also, we develop an efficient scheduling scheme using genetic algorithms (GAs) and evaluate the effect of different parameters, such as channel/precoding models, number of antennas/users, scheduling costs, and power amplifiers' efficiency, on the system performance. Finally, we use the recent results on the achievable rates of finite block-length codes to analyze the system performance in the cases with short packets. As demonstrated, the proposed GA-based scheduler reaches (almost) the same throughput as in the exhaustive search-based optimal scheduler, with substantially less implementation complexity. Moreover, the power amplifiers' inefficiency and the scheduling delay affect the performance of the scheduling-based systems significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2878252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8605558/08520925.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2878252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Throughput of Large-but-Finite MIMO Networks Using Schedulers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8520925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8520925/","displayDocTitle":"On the Throughput of Large-but-Finite MIMO Networks Using Schedulers","volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18400965","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8520925/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Throughput of Large-but-Finite MIMO Networks Using Schedulers","sourcePdf":"twc-makki-2878252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141159S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8520925","onlineDate":"02 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8521050,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

These approaches typically focus on estimating target STFT magnitudes and ignore problems of phase inconsistency. In this paper, we explicitly integrate phase reconstruction into our separation algorithm using a loss function defined on time-domain signals. A deep neural network structure is defined by unfolding a phase reconstruction algorithm and treating each iteration as a layer in our network. Furthermore, instead of using fixed STFT/iSTFT time-frequency representations, we allow our network to learn a modified version of these representations from data. We compare several variants of these unfolded phase reconstruction networks achieving state of the art results on the publicly available wsj0-2mix dataset, and show improved performance when the STFT/iSTFT-like representations are allowed to adapt.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Time-frequency analysis","Spectrogram","Training","Source separation","Conferences","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","source separation","speaker recognition","speech enhancement","speech processing","speech recognition","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-channel speech separation","cocktail party problem","multiple overlapping speakers","phase inconsistency","separation algorithm","loss function","time-domain signals","time-frequency representations","deep neural network","STFT/iSTFT-like representations","STFT/iSTFT time-frequency representations","phase reconstruction algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Source separation","iterative phase reconstruction","learnable representations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521243","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521243.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Reconstruction with Learned Time-Frequency Representations for Single-Channel Speech Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase Reconstruction with Learned Time-Frequency Representations for Single-Channel Speech Separation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521243/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521243/","accessionNumber":"18205497","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Reconstruction with Learned Time-Frequency Representations for Single-Channel Speech Separation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"080_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059019S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8521248,"authors":[{"name":"Lara Nahma","affiliation":["Curtin University, Bentley, Australia"],"firstName":"Lara","lastName":"Nahma","id":"37086001158"},{"name":"Hai Huyen Dam","affiliation":["Curtin University, Bentley, Australia"],"firstName":"Hai Huyen","lastName":"Dam","id":"37085431730"},{"name":"Sven Nordholm","affiliation":["Curtin University, Bentley, Australia"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Nordholm","id":"37274680800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521248","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Reverberation","Cost function","Sensitivity","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","least squares approximations","microphone arrays","optimisation","reverberation","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphone characteristics","acoustic environment","robust broadband beamformer design","weighted least square optimization technique","room reverberation","microphone gain","phase characteristics","room impulse response","error sensitivity","image source method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Near field beamformer design","signal enhancement","dereverberation","robust broadband beamformer"]}],"abstract":"Broadband beamformers are known to be sensitive not only to mismatches in microphone characteristics but also in the acoustic environment.

But in its original formulation, WPE requires multiple iterations over a sufficiently long utterance, rendering it unsuitable for online low-latency applications. Recently, two methods have been proposed to overcome this limitation. One utilizes a neural network to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) of the target signal and works in a block-online fashion. The other method relies on a rather simple PSD estimation which smoothes the observed PSD and utilizes a recursive formulation which enables it to work on a frame-by-frame basis. In this paper, we integrate a deep neural network (DNN) based estimator into the recursive frame-online formulation. We evaluate the performance of the recursive system with different PSD estimators in comparison to the block-online and offline variant on two distinct corpora. The REVERB challenge data, where the signal is mainly deteriorated by reverberation, and a database which combines WSJ and VoiceHome to also consider (directed) noise sources. The results show that although smoothing works surprisingly well, the more sophisticated DNN based estimator shows promising improvements and shortens the performance gap between online and offline processing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reverberation","Estimation","Conferences","Neural networks","Indexes","Microphones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","neural nets","reverberation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame-online DNN-WPE dereverberation","signal dereverberation","weighted prediction error method","far-field speech recognition","original formulation","sufficiently long utterance","low-latency applications","power spectral density","target signal","block-online fashion","simple PSD estimation","observed PSD","recursive formulation","frame-by-frame basis","deep neural network based estimator","recursive frame-online formulation","recursive system","sophisticated DNN based estimator","offline processing","PSD estimators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech recognition","online speech enhancement","dereverberation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521255","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521255","startPage":"466","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521255.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521255/","displayDocTitle":"Frame-Online DNN-WPE Dereverberation","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18202138","htmlLink":"/document/8521255/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frame-Online DNN-WPE Dereverberation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"094_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084944S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521259,"authors":[{"name":"Shlomo E.

The enhancement capabilities of spatial processor can be very high, provided that all its building blocks are accurately estimated. Data-driven estimation approaches can be very attractive since they do not rely on accurate statistical models, which is usually unavailable. However, training a DNN with multi-microphone data is a challenging task, due to inevitable differences between the train and test phases. In this work, we present an estimation procedure for controlling a linearly-constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer for speaker extraction and noise reduction. We propose an attention-based DNN for speaker diarization that is applicable to the task at hand. In the proposed scheme, each microphone signal propagates through a dedicated DNN and an attention mechanism selects the most informative microphone. This approach has the potential of mitigating the mismatch between training and test phases and can therefore lead to an improved speaker extraction performance.","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521259","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521259.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"305","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attention-Based Neural Network for Joint Diarization and Speaker Extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Attention-Based Neural Network for Joint Diarization and Speaker Extraction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18202140","publicationDate":"September 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521259/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attention-Based Neural Network for Joint Diarization and Speaker Extraction","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"061_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112834S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521260,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan M.

We propose a source separation method that does not require offset estimation or signal resampling. Instead, we divide the distributed array into several synchronous subarrays.

The economic costs and social burdens brought by these two diseases are considerable. Even though there are proven methodologies for diagnosing each disease individually in practice, there does not exist a single non-invasive methodology/procedure that can detect both diseases. With recent advancements made in machine learning and pattern recognition, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used in many recognition applications due to its high efficiency and performance. Therefore, in this paper we propose an approach using CNN for non-invasive multi-disease classification called Multi-Disease CNN (MD-CNN). Facial images are first captured using our specially designed device. Next, four facial blocks are extracted located at specific regions on the face. Finally, the facial blocks are concatenated and used as input for our MD-CNN. Based on three datasets consisting of healthy control, diabetes and lung disease, the proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 73%. When compared to other classifiers not employing a deep learning architecture, MD-CNN produced the highest result. This show a potentially new way to perform multi-disease classification.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2018.8521262","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8496895/8521239/08521262.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2018.8521262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Invasive Multi-Disease Classification via Facial Image Analysis Using a Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 July 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521262/","displayDocTitle":"Non-Invasive Multi-Disease Classification via Facial Image Analysis Using a Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521262/","publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","conferenceDate":"15-18 July 2018","accessionNumber":"18202094","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Invasive Multi-Disease Classification via Facial Image Analysis Using a Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0066_8028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086538S","chronDate":"15-18 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8496895","isNumber":"8521239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8496895","xplore-issue":"8521239","articleId":"8521262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521287,"authors":[{"name":"Hendrik Barfuss","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Hendrik","lastName":"Barfuss","id":"37085497274"},{"name":"Markus Bachmann","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Bachmann","id":"37086290126"},{"name":"Christian Huemmer","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Huemmer","id":"37077390700"},{"name":"Walter Kellermann","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Kellermann","id":"37274601000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521287","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Microphone arrays","Optimization","Acoustic beams","Finite impulse response filters","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","beam steering","interpolation","microphone arrays","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphone array symmetry","flexible beam steering","data-independent beamformer","polynomial interpolation","planar uniform circular microphone array","2D robust polynomial beamformer","PLD","prototype look directions","robust 2D polynomial beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust superdirective beamforming","polynomial beamforming","array symmetry","white noise gain"]}],"abstract":"Polynomial beamforming is an effective approach for flexible beam steering of a data-independent beamformer.

This concept is experimentally verified for a planar uniform circular microphone array by means of signal-independent measures.","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521287","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521287.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521287","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","startPage":"486","endPage":"490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Microphone Array Symmetry for Robust Two-Dimensional Polynomial Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Microphone Array Symmetry for Robust Two-Dimensional Polynomial Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521287/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521287/","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18245336","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Microphone Array Symmetry for Robust Two-Dimensional Polynomial Beamforming","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"098_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089729S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521295,"authors":[{"name":"Nico G\u00f6\u00dfling","affiliation":["University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"G\u00f6\u00dfling","id":"37085992778"},{"name":"Simon Doclo","affiliation":["University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Doclo","id":"37267398500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521295","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Estimation","Microphone arrays","Speech enhancement","Acoustics","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","microphone arrays","transfer functions","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relative transfer function estimation","noise field diffusion","reference microphone array signals","spatially separated microphones","RTF vector estimator","acoustic transfer functions","relative transfer function vector","multimicrophone speech enhancement algorithms","noise reduction performance","spatial coherence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relative transter function","external microphone","acoustic sensor network","speech enhancement","MVDR"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative Transfer Function Estimation Exploiting Spatially Separated Microphones in a Diffuse Noise Field","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521295.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521295","startPage":"146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521295","abstract":"Many multi-microphone speech enhancement algorithms require the relative transfer function (RTF) vector of the desired speech source, relating the acoustic transfer functions of all array microphones to a reference microphone. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method to estimate the RTF vector in a diffuse noise field, which requires an additional microphone that is spatially separated from the microphone array, such that the spatial coherence between the noise components in the microphone array signals and the additional microphone signal is low. Assuming this spatial coherence to be zero, we show that an unbiased estimate of the RTF vector can be obtained. Based on real-world recordings experimental results show that the proposed RTF estimator outperforms state-of-the-art estimators using only the microphone array signals in terms of estimation accuracy and noise reduction performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18245390","htmlLink":"/document/8521295/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Relative Transfer Function Estimation Exploiting Spatially Separated Microphones in a Diffuse Noise Field","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative Transfer Function Estimation Exploiting Spatially Separated Microphones in a Diffuse Noise Field","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"030_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059508S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521304,"authors":[{"name":"Kohei Yatabe","affiliation":["Department of Intermedia Art and Science, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Yatabe","id":"37085481014"},{"name":"Yoshiki Masuyama","affiliation":["Department of Intermedia Art and Science, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiki","lastName":"Masuyama","id":"37086454054"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Oikawa","affiliation":["Department of Intermedia Art and Science, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Oikawa","id":"37425682700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521304","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Spectrogram","Harmonic analysis","Time-frequency analysis","Speech enhancement","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","harmonic distortion","neural nets","signal denoising","speech enhancement","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Griffin-Lim phase recovery","time-domain signal","corresponding spectrogram","deep neural network","inverse STFT","time-domain counterpart","leaky rectified linear unit","nonlinear operation","time domain","speech enhancement method","harmonic regeneration noise reduction","HRNR","time-domain nonlinearity","higher-order harmonics","time-domain ReLU","Griffin-Lim algorithm","short-time objective intelligibility","inverse short-time Fourier transform","DNN-based phase recovery method","STOI","oracle Wiener filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrogram","redundancy","consistency","time-domain nonlinearity","harmonic regeneration"]}],"abstract":"Phase recovery is an essential process for reconstructing a time-domain signal from the corresponding spectrogram when its phase is contaminated or unavailable. Recently, a phase recovery method using deep neural network (DNN) was proposed, which interested us because the inverse short-time Fourier transform (inverse STFT) was utilized within the network. This inverse STFT converts a spectrogram into its time-domain counterpart, and then the activation function, leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU), is applied. Such nonlinear operation in time domain resembles the speech enhancement method called the harmonic regeneration noise reduction (HRNR). In HRNR, a time-domain nonlinearity, typically ReLU, is applied for assistance in enhancing the higher-order harmonics. From this point of view, one question arose in our mind: Can time-domain ReLU solely assist phase recovery? Inspired by this curious connection between the recent DNN-based phase recovery method and HRNR in speech enhancement, the ReLU assisted Griffin-Lim algorithm is proposed in this paper to investigate the above question. Through an experiment of speech denoising with the oracle Wiener filter, some positive effect of the time-domain nonlinearity is confirmed in terms of the scores of the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI).","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521304","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521304.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rectified Linear Unit Can Assist Griffin-Lim Phase Recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521304/","displayDocTitle":"Rectified Linear Unit Can Assist Griffin-Lim Phase Recovery","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18202139","htmlLink":"/document/8521304/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rectified Linear Unit Can Assist Griffin-Lim Phase Recovery","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"112_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07454S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521310,"authors":[{"name":"Mawardi Bahri","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Hasanuddin University, Makassar, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mawardi","lastName":"Bahri","id":"38474172000"},{"name":"Ryuichi Ashino","affiliation":["Mathematics and Informatics, Osaka Kyoiku University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuichi","lastName":"Ashino","id":"37597160100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5218-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5216-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5219-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2158-5695"}],"articleNumber":"8521310","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quaternions","Fourier transforms","Wavelet transforms","Algebra","Convolution","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duality (mathematics)","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hausdorff-Young inequality","scalar Parseval formula","two-sided quaternion Fourier transform","duality property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quaternion Fourier transform","Duality","Hausdorff-Young inequality"]}],"abstract":"An alternative proof of scalar Parseval's formula with respect to the two-sided quaternion Fourier transform is presented.

In audio signal and speech processing, the amplitude spectrogram is often used for processing, and the corresponding phase spectrogram is reconstructed from the amplitude spectrogram on the basis of the Griffin-Lim method. However, the Griffin-Lim method causes unnatural artifacts in synthetic speech. Addressing this problem, we introduce the von-Mises-distribution DNN for phase reconstruction. The DNN is a generative model having the von Mises distribution that can model distributions of a periodic variable such as a phase, and the model parameters of the DNN are estimated on the basis of the maximum likelihood criterion. Furthermore, we propose a group-delay loss for DNN training to make the predicted group delay close to a natural group delay. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) the trained DNN can predict group delay accurately more than phases themselves, and 2) our phase reconstruction methods achieve better speech quality than the conventional Griffin-Lim method.","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521313.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Reconstruction from Amplitude Spectrograms Based on Von-Mises-Distribution Deep Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Phase Reconstruction from Amplitude Spectrograms Based on Von-Mises-Distribution Deep Neural Network","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18205495","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521313/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Reconstruction from Amplitude Spectrograms Based on Von-Mises-Distribution Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"058_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103818S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521324,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Yen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Yen","id":"37086505689"},{"name":"Yusuke Hioka","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Hioka","id":"38565532300"},{"name":"Brian Mace","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Mace","id":"37601474800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521324","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Microphone arrays","Acoustics","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Array signal processing","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio recording","autonomous aerial vehicles","learning (artificial intelligence)","noise","rotors","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicle rotor noise","nonacoustic information","rotor noise PSD estimation accuracy","UAV rotor characteristics","spectral distortion","power spectral density estimation","UAV-mounted audio recording system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone array","unmanned aerial vehicle","source enhancement","power spectral density","rotor noise"]}],"abstract":"A method to accurately estimate an unmanned aerial vehicle's (UAV) rotor noise power spectral density (PSD) is proposed, as part of the development of an effective UAV-mounted audio recording system that clearly captures the desired sound signals.

Speech is one of the primary forms of expression and is an important modality for emotion recognition. While multiple recognition systems exist, the most common ones identify discrete categories such as happiness, sadness, from distinct utterances that are a few seconds long. In many cases the datasets, used for training and evaluation, are imbalanced across the emotion labels. This leads to big discrepancies between the unweighted accuracy (UA) and weighted accuracy (WA). Recently Deep Neural Networks have shown increased performance for the emotion classification task. In particular Convolutional Neural Networks capture contextual information from speech feature frames. In this paper we analyze various convolutional architectures for speech emotion recognition. We report performance on different frame level features. Further we analyze various pooling techniques, on top of convolutional layers, to get a utterance level representation for the emotion. Our best system provides a performance of UA + WA of 121.15 compared to the baseline algorithm performance of

ridge regression with the constraint of the Helmholtz equation for three-dimensional sound field interpolation is proposed. Interpolation of a sound field is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective function to be minimized is a weighted sum of the squared residuals and the squared norm of the interpolating sound field. We show that this problem corresponds to kernel ridge regression and that the reproducing kernel for this problem is given by the zeroth-order spherical Bessel function of the first kind. In this kernel, the physical constraint on the sound fields, i.e., the Helmholtz equation, is taken into consideration, which is a major advantage over other commonly used kernels such as the Gaussian kernel. This advantage is also confirmed by numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18202142","htmlLink":"/document/8521334/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Kernel Ridge Regression with Constraint of Helmholtz Equation for Sound Field Interpolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel Ridge Regression with Constraint of Helmholtz Equation for Sound Field Interpolation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"088_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089196S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521336,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Shuyang","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Shuyang","id":"37086171570"},{"name":"Toni Heittola","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Heittola","id":"37645177800"},{"name":"Tuomas Virtanen","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Virtanen","id":"37285488100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521336","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"abstract":"This paper proposes an active learning method to control a labeling process for efficient annotation of acoustic training material, which is used for training sound event classifiers. The proposed method performs K-medoids clustering over an initially unlabeled dataset, and medoids as local representatives, are presented to an annotator for manual annotation. The annotated label on a medoid propagates to other samples in its cluster for label prediction. After annotating the medoids, the annotation continues to the unexamined sounds with mismatched prediction results from two classifiers, a nearest-neighbor classifier and a model-based classifier, both trained with annotated data. The annotation on the segments with mismatched predictions are ordered by the distance to the nearest annotated sample, farthest first. The evaluation is made on a public environmental sound dataset. The labels obtained through a labeling process controlled by the proposed method are used to train a classifier, using supervised learning. Only 20% of the data needs to be manually annotated with the proposed method, to achieve the accuracy with all the data annotated. In addition, the proposed method clearly outperforms other active learning algorithms proposed for sound event classification through all the experiments, simulating varying fraction of data that is manually labeled.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Labeling","Acoustics","Training","Predictive models","Clustering algorithms","Measurement","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["labeling process","acoustic training material","sound event classifiers","K-medoids","initially unlabeled dataset","annotator","manual annotation","annotated label","label prediction","unexamined sounds","mismatched prediction results","nearest-neighbor classifier","model-based classifier","annotated data","mismatched predictions","nearest annotated sample","public environmental sound dataset","labels","supervised learning","active learning algorithms","sound event classification","active learning method","medoid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active learning","K-medoids clustering","committee-based sample selection","sound event classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521336","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521336.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Active Learning Method Using Clustering and Committee-Based Sample Selection for Sound Event Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Active Learning Method Using Clustering and Committee-Based Sample Selection for Sound Event Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521336/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521336/","accessionNumber":"18202130","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Active Learning Method Using Clustering and Committee-Based Sample Selection for Sound Event Classification","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"024_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058524S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8521345,"authors":[{"name":"Henning Schepker","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Acoustics and Cluster of Excellence Hearing4All, University of Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Schepker","id":"37085506899"},{"name":"Linh.

By steering a spatial null in the direction of the hearing aid loudspeaker theoretically perfect feedback cancellation can be achieved. In contrast to previous approaches that constrained the beamformer coefficients in a reference microphone to a simple delay, in this paper we use a constraint based on the relative transfer function of the incoming signal aiming to perfectly preserve the incoming signal. Experimental results using measured acoustic feedback paths from a custom earpiece with three microphones show that the proposed RTF constrained null- steering beamformer allows to substantially increase the added stable gain even for unknown acoustic feedback paths, e.g., with a telephone receiver close to the ear. Furthermore, it yields a high perceptual speech quality of the incoming signal even for unknown incoming signal directions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18245383","htmlLink":"/document/8521345/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic Feedback Cancellation for Hearing Aids Using a Fixed RTF-Constrained Null-Steering Beamformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic Feedback Cancellation for Hearing Aids Using a Fixed RTF-Constrained Null-Steering Beamformer","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"087_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077589S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521346,"authors":[{"name":"Soumitro Chakrabarty","affiliation":["International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Soumitro","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37085583786"},{"name":"DeLiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Center for Cognitive & Brain Sciences, The Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"DeLiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37077285500"},{"name":"Emanuel A.

In this work, a time-frequency masking based method for speech enhancement with multi -channel data using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed, where the CNN is trained to estimate the ideal ratio mask by discriminating directional speech source from diffuse or spatially uncorrelated noise. The proposed method operates on, frame-by-frame, the magnitude and phase components of the short-time Fourier transform coefficients of all frequency sub-bands and microphones. The avoidance of temporal context and explicit feature extraction makes the proposed method suitable for online implementation.

Experiments using the real data of the CHiME-3 multichannel noisy speech corpus show that the proposed method greatly outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of improving the word error rate (WER).","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521354","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521354.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Integration of DNN-Based and Spatial Clustering-Based Mask Estimation for Robust MVDR Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online Integration of DNN-Based and Spatial Clustering-Based Mask Estimation for Robust MVDR Beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521354/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18245327","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521354/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Integration of DNN-Based and Spatial Clustering-Based Mask Estimation for Robust MVDR Beamforming","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"015_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124034S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521355,"authors":[{"name":"Nico G\u00f6\u00dfling","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Acoustics and Cluster of Excellence Hearing4All, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"G\u00f6\u00dfling","id":"37086504641"},{"name":"Daniel Marquardt","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Acoustics and Cluster of Excellence Hearing4All, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Marquardt","id":"38469679600"},{"name":"Ivo Merks","affiliation":["Star key Hearing Technologies, Eden Prairie, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Ivo","lastName":"Merks","id":"37611559600"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Star key Hearing Technologies, Eden Prairie, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37710818200"},{"name":"Simon Doclo","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Acoustics and Cluster of Excellence Hearing4All, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Doclo","id":"37267398500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521355","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Auditory system","Microphones","Correlation","Acoustics","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","handicapped aids","hearing aids","interference suppression","signal denoising","speech enhancement","speech intelligibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy environments","spatial impression","acoustic scene","BMVDR beamformer","binaural cues","BLCMV beamformer","interfering sources","temporal observation interval","required beamformer quantities","complex acoustic scenario","optimal interference scaling parameters","head-mounted assistive listening devices","speech quality","speech intelligibility","optimal binaural LCMV beamforming","measured impulse responses","hearing aids","decent noise reduction","binaural cue errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hearing aids","binaural cues","noise reduction","beamforming","BLCMV","RTF"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521355","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521355","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","abstract":"Binaural beamforming algorithms for head-mounted assistive listening devices are crucial to improve speech quality and speech intelligibility in noisy environments, while maintaining the spatial impression of the acoustic scene. While the well-known BMVDR beamformer is able to preserve the binaural cues of one desired source, the BLCMV beamformer uses additional constraints to also preserve the binaural cues of interfering sources. In this paper, we provide theoretical and practical insights on how to optimally set the interference scaling parameters in the BLCMV beamformer for an arbitrary number of interfering sources. In addition, since in practice only a limited temporal observation interval is available to estimate all required beamformer quantities, we provide an experimental evaluation in a complex acoustic scenario using measured impulse responses from hearing aids in a cafeteria for different observation intervals. The results show that even rather short observation intervals are sufficient to achieve a decent noise reduction performance and that a proposed threshold on the optimal interference scaling parameters leads to smaller binaural cue errors in practice.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","startPage":"381","endPage":"385","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521355.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Binaural LCMV Beamforming in Complex Acoustic Scenarios: Theoretical and Practical Insights","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521355/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Binaural LCMV Beamforming in Complex Acoustic Scenarios: Theoretical and Practical Insights","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18245392","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Binaural LCMV Beamforming in Complex Acoustic Scenarios: Theoretical and Practical Insights","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"077_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065577S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521368,"authors":[{"name":"Randall Ali","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Randall","lastName":"Ali","id":"37085898405"},{"name":"Toon Van Waterschoot","affiliation":["e-Media Research Lab, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Toon","lastName":"Van Waterschoot","id":"37713508200"},{"name":"Marc Moonen","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moonen","id":"37274397700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521368","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Correlation","Noise reduction","Matrix decomposition","Estimation","Transfer functions","Barium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","microphone arrays","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relative transfer functions","multimicrophone noise reduction","reference microphone","minimum variance distortionless response beamformer","external microphone","local microphone array","MVDR beamformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["\u2015Multi-Microphone Noise Reduction","Beamforming","MVDR","External Microphone","Relative transfer Function"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Completing the RTF Vector for an MVDR Beamformer as Applied to a Local Microphone Array and an External Microphone","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521368","startPage":"211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521368","abstract":"A minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer can be an effective multi-microphone noise reduction strategy' provided that a vector of transfer functions from the desired speech signal at a reference microphone to the other microphones, i.e. a vector of the relative transfer functions (RTFs), is known. When using a local microphone array (LMA) and an external microphone (XM), this RTF vector has two distinct parts: an RTF vector for that of only the LMA and a single RTF component for the XM, with the reference microphone on the LMA. Whereas a priori assumptions can be made for the RTF vector for the LMA, the RTF for the XM must be estimated as the XM position is generally unknown. This paper investigates a procedure for estimating this unknown RTF by making use of the a priori RTF vector for the LMA, thereby completing the RTF vector for use of the MVDR beamformer. It is shown that such a procedure results in an Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) of a 2\u00d72 matrix for a system of M microphones in the LMA and one XM.

The proposed framework provides increased flexibility for various aspects of system design such as gain estimation, relative to end-to-end DNN-based systems. Additionally, the DNN can be trained to detect speech in the presence of both noise and reverberation, leading to joint suppression of additive noise and reverberation.

Furthermore, the proposed method yields better results than those obtained using ideal binary masks for a singing voice separation task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18245386","htmlLink":"/document/8521383/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Mmdenselstm: An Efficient Combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Audio Source Separation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mmdenselstm: An Efficient Combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Audio Source Separation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"022_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070266S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521385,"authors":[{"name":"Nobutaka Ito","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobutaka","lastName":"Ito","id":"37077363400"},{"name":"Tomohiro Nakatani","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37342222600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521385","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Acceleration","Source separation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Time-frequency analysis","Microphones","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","covariance analysis","covariance matrices","iterative methods","matrix inversion","matrix multiplication","parameter estimation","source separation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix inversion","matrix multiplication","FastFCA-AS","accelerated algorithm","iterative parameter estimation algorithm","full-rank spatial covariance analysis","audio source separation method","time-frequency point","restricted computational resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone arrays","source separation","joint diagonalization"]}],"abstract":"Here we propose FastFCA-AS, an accelerated algorithm for Full-rank spatial Covariance Analysis (FCA), which is a robust audio source separation method proposed by Duong et al. [\u201cUnder-determined reverberant audio source separation using a full-rank spatial covariance model,\u201d IEEE Trans. ASLP, vol. 18, no. 7, pp. 1830-1840, Sept. 2010]. In the conventional FCA, matrix inversion and matrix multiplication are required at each time-frequency point in each iteration of an iterative parameter estimation algorithm. This causes a heavy computational load, thereby rendering the FCA infeasible in many applications. To overcome this drawback, we take a joint diagonalization approach, whereby matrix inversion and matrix multiplication are reduced to mere inversion and multiplication of diagonal entries. This makes the FastFCA-AS significantly faster than the FCA and even applicable to observed data of long duration or a situation with restricted computational resources. Although we have already proposed another acceleration of the FCA for two sources, the proposed FastFCA-AS is applicable to an arbitrary number of sources. In an experiment with three sources and three microphones, the FastFCA-AS was over 420 times faster than the FCA with a slightly better source separation performance.","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521385","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521385.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","startPage":"151","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fastfca-As: Joint Diagonalization Based Acceleration of Full-Rank Spatial Covariance Analysis for Separating any Number of Sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fastfca-As: Joint Diagonalization Based Acceleration of Full-Rank Spatial Covariance Analysis for Separating any Number of Sources","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521385/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18245369","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521385/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fastfca-As: Joint Diagonalization Based Acceleration of Full-Rank Spatial Covariance Analysis for Separating any Number of Sources","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"031_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071336S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521389,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyue Zhao","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweige, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Ziyue","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086504300"},{"name":"Samy Elshamy","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweige, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Samy","lastName":"Elshamy","id":"37085582644"},{"name":"Huijun Liu","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweige, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Huijun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086503832"},{"name":"Tim Fingscheidt","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweige, Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Fingscheidt","id":"37298976300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521389","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CNN Postprocessor to Enhance Coded Speech","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521389.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"410","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521389","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech coding","Cepstral analysis","Speech enhancement","Codecs","Wideband","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","filtering theory","speech coding","speech enhancement","transcoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN postprocessor","enhance coded speech","trans-coded speech","convolutional neural network-based postprocessor","cepstral domain features","transcoded speech","narrowband codecs","wideband codecs","coded speech quality","WB-PESQ","AMR-WB","MOS-LQO points"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech codecs","speech enhancement","convolutional neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521389","abstract":"Postprocessors can be advantageously used to enhance trans-coded speech after the decoder on the receiver side.

However, increasing the number of microphones requires more hardware and raises effort, e.g., in calibration. Instead of measuring at any desired position, it is possible to spatially interpolate the sound field between sampled positions, in order to obtain estimates at unknown positions. Nevertheless, the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem should be met, which still demands a large number of spatial sampling points for large bandwidths. In this paper, we present a compressed-sensing approach that allows for stable and robust interpolation of room impulse responses using less measurements than required by the sampling theorem. Based on a small set of spatially subsampled room impulse responses, the proposed method is capable of providing an enlarged set allowing for aliasing- free reconstruction in space.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521390.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"430","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Interpolation of Room Impulse Responses Using Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Microphones","Position measurement","Linear systems","Kernel","Coherence","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","interpolation","microphones","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial interpolation","room impulse responses","compressed sensing","sampling theorem","Nyquist-Shannonsampling theorem","microphones"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Room impulse responses","spatial interpolation","compressed sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Interpolation of Room Impulse Responses Using Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521390/","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18205500","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Interpolation of Room Impulse Responses Using Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"086_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072052S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521392,"authors":[{"name":"Hwiyong Choi","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hwiyong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37086501245"},{"name":"Seungjun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seungjun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086506022"},{"name":"Haesang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Haesang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086503522"},{"name":"Woojae Seong","affiliation":["Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Woojae","lastName":"Seong","id":"37337953500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521392","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Noise Between Floors in a Building Using Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521392","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Floors","Shape","Visualization","Convolution","Conferences","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","acoustic signal processing","buildings (structures)","feedforward neural nets","floors","learning (artificial intelligence)","signal classification","signal processing","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["apartment complex","serious social conflict issue","visual geometry group","scaled mel-spectrograms","k-fold cross validation","network architecture","noise source location","building floors","pretrained convolutional neural networks","pretrained deep convolutional neural networks","noise type classification","Korea"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise between floors","auditory scene classification","pre-trained convolutional neural networks","mel-spectrogram"]}],"abstract":"This paper suggests a method for source location and type classification of noise between floors at an apartment complex, which is a serious social conflict issue in Korea.

The proposed system is trained and tested on noisy speech data where signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges from -5 dB to +5 dB and the results show significant reduction of non-speech content in the resulting signal while still meeting a low-latency operation criterion, which is here considered to be less than 20 ms.","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521400","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521400.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Frequency Masking Strategies for Single-Channel Low-Latency Speech Enhancement Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521400/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time-Frequency Masking Strategies for Single-Channel Low-Latency Speech Enhancement Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521400/","accessionNumber":"18245352","publicationDate":"September 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Frequency Masking Strategies for Single-Channel Low-Latency Speech Enhancement Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"011_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099718S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521401,"authors":[{"name":"Sota Nishiguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Sota","lastName":"Nishiguchi","id":"37086504240"},{"name":"Yuma Koizumi","affiliation":["NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuma","lastName":"Koizumi","id":"37085741041"},{"name":"Noboru Harada","affiliation":["NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Noboru","lastName":"Harada","id":"37289885600"},{"name":"Katunobu Itou","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Katunobu","lastName":"Itou","id":"37086502555"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521401","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521401","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Source separation","Harmonic analysis","Microphone arrays","Training","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","harmonic analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","source separation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective acoustic features","spherical-harmonic-analysis-based acoustic features","deep neural network","DNN-based near-field source separation","DNN-based far-field source separation","deep-learning based source separation","time-frequency mask","low frequency band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","near-field source separation","spherical harmonic analysis","acoustic feature"]}],"abstract":"We propose the combination of a physical-model-based and a deep-learning (DL)-based source separation for near- and far-field source separation. The DL-based near- and far-field source separation method uses spherical-harmonic-analysis-based acoustic features. Deep learning is a state-of-the-art technique for source separation. In this approach, a deep neural network (D NN) is used to predict a time-frequency (T-F) mask. To accurately predict a T-F mask, it is necessary to use acoustic features that have high mutual information with the oracle T-F mask. However, the effective acoustic features to separate near- and far-field sources are unknown. In this study, low-frequency-band near- and far-field sources are estimated based on spherical harmonic analysis and used as acoustic features. Subsequently, a DNN predicts a T-F mask to separate all frequency bands. Our experimental results show that the proposed method improved the signal-to-distortion-rate by 6-8 dB compared to the harmonic-analysis-based method.","publicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521401.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521401","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DNN-Based Near- and Far-Field Source Separation Using Spherical-Harmonic-Analysis-Based Acoustic Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DNN-Based Near- and Far-Field Source Separation Using Spherical-Harmonic-Analysis-Based Acoustic Features","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521401/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521401/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18245356","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNN-Based Near- and Far-Field Source Separation Using Spherical-Harmonic-Analysis-Based Acoustic Features","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"103_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12931S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521403,"authors":[{"name":"Laur\u00e9line Perotin","affiliation":["Orange Labs 4 rue du Clos Courtel, France"],"firstName":"Laur\u00e9line","lastName":"Perotin","id":"37086454688"},{"name":"Romain Serizel","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, CNRS, Inria, Loria, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Serizel","id":"37681556600"},{"name":"Emmanuel Vincent","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, CNRS, Inria, Loria, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Vincent","id":"37300852600"},{"name":"Alexandre Gu\u00e9rin","affiliation":["Orange Labs 4 rue du Clos Courtel, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Gu\u00e9rin","id":"37681529900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8151-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8150-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8152-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8521403","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":507},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521403","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Training","Acoustics","Azimuth","Convolution","Time-frequency analysis","Microphones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic intensity","acoustic signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","feedforward neural nets","microphones","recurrent neural nets","reverberation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recent CRNN-based system","elevation localization","source localization system","recurrent neural network","FOA acoustic intensity vector","sound direction","DoA","point source","azimuth elevation","stacked convolutional neural network","first-order ambisonics contents","ambisonics intensity vector","CRNN-based joint azimuth localization","direction of arrival","microphone orientations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction of arrival","first-order Ambisonics (FOA)","acoustic intensity","CRNN"]}],"abstract":"We present a source localization system for first-order Ambisonics (FOA) contents based on a stacked convolutional and recurrent neural network (CRNN).

We focus on scenarios with a single desired speaker in a non-stationary environmental noise. Many modern beamformers are designed using the desired speaker transfer function (TF), or the respective relative transfer function (RTF). If the relative source position is fixed, tracking the RTF can be avoided. On top of reducing the computational complexity' this may also circumvent the beamformer from enhancing competing sources. In this work, to target such applications, we propose a technique for obtaining a spatially robust generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) beamformer with controlled white noise gain (WNG). The proposed implementation will introduce robustness to mismatch between the assumed and actual RTFs while maintaining sufficiently large WNG. It allows for high flexibility in shaping the desired response, while maintaining low computational complexity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521237","startPage":"231","endPage":"235","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500052/8521237/08521405.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Robust GSC Beamforming with Controlled White Noise Gain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521405/","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Robust GSC Beamforming with Controlled White Noise Gain","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18245364","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Robust GSC Beamforming with Controlled White Noise Gain","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"047_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082602S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521407,"authors":[{"name":"Anyong Qin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Anyong","lastName":"Qin","id":"37086039237"},{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085578892"},{"name":"Zhaowei Shang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaowei","lastName":"Shang","id":"37286434500"},{"name":"Jinyu Tian","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Jinyu","lastName":"Tian","id":"37086046982"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5218-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5216-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5219-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2158-5695"}],"articleNumber":"8521407","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521407","abstract":"Collecting label samples is quite costly and time consuming for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks.

When applied to the design of DMAs, the major advantages of using these approximate measures is that the design problem is simplified and many differential beamformers, including commonly-used standard ones, can be easily derived.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521409/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18245325","publicationDate":"September 2018","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521409/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Differential Beamformers Derived from Approximate Performance Measures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Beamformers Derived from Approximate Performance Measures","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"014_Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100285S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500052","isNumber":"8521237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8521237","articleId":"8521409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521508,"authors":[{"name":"Michalis Florides","affiliation":["University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Michalis","lastName":"Florides","id":"37086407624"},{"name":"Georgios Konstantinou","affiliation":["University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Konstantinou","id":"37397487200"},{"name":"Venizelos Venizelou","affiliation":["University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Venizelos","lastName":"Venizelou","id":"37086390241"},{"name":"George Makrides","affiliation":["University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Makrides","id":"37402294700"},{"name":"George E.

It first studies the secrecy capacity of two single-antenna full-duplex users against a multi-antenna eavesdropper (Eve) who has the perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) from users to Eve. It is shown that if Eve uses a basic matched-filtering, the probability of zero secrecy (or outage) can be made small by a large jamming power from both users and a small gain of residual self-interference (RSI) power. But if Eve uses the optimal matched-filtering, the probability of outage grows rapidly as either the jamming power from the users increases or the number of antennas on Eve increases, regardless of the RSI gain. To prevent any Eve from obtaining its CSI, this paper then proposes a novel anti-eavesdropping channel estimation (ANECE) method, which allows users to obtain their own CSI while keeping all Eves in handicap. This method also prevents Eves from colluding with each other at any layer. The design of ideal pilots for ANECE for multiple multi-antenna users and multiple broadband multi-antenna users is discussed. It is also shown that the capacity of Eve with any number of antennas but without its CSI can be virtually eliminated over a time window corresponding to the number of antennas at the transmitter for each realization of the CSI.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2879621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8541135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8541135/08521580.pdf","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Properties of Full-Duplex Radio for Securing Wireless Network","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2879621","startPage":"120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Properties of Full-Duplex Radio for Securing Wireless Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521580/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18281632","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8521580/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-17-1-0581"},{"fundingName":"U.S. Government"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Properties of Full-Duplex Radio for Securing Wireless Network","sourcePdf":"tsp-hua-2879621-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144405S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8541135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8541135","articleId":"8521580","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521585,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Wan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Rhode Island, South Kingstown, RI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8809237/8521585/wan-2879572-small.gif","p":["Zhiqiang Wan (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2012 and the M.S. degree from the School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2015.

When EVs participate in demand response program which has real-time pricing signals, the charging cost can be greatly reduced by taking full advantage of these pricing signals. However, it is challenging to determine an optimal charging strategy due to the existence of randomness in traffic conditions, user's commuting behavior, and the pricing process of the utility. Conventional model-based approaches require a model of forecast on the uncertainty and optimization for the scheduling process. In this paper, we formulate this scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with unknown transition probability. A model-free approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to determine the optimal strategy for this problem. The proposed approach can adaptively learn the transition probability and does not require any system model information. The architecture of the proposed approach contains two networks: a representation network to extract discriminative features from the electricity prices and a Q network to approximate the optimal action-value function. Numerous experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2018.2879572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8809237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2018.2879572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8809237/08521585.pdf","startPage":"5246","endPage":"5257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Free Real-Time EV Charging Scheduling Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Model-Free Real-Time EV Charging Scheduling Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning","volume":"10","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521585/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18938019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521585/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-18-1-2396"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Free Real-Time EV Charging Scheduling Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tsg-he-2879572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139009S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8809237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"8809237","articleId":"8521585","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8521589,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Tan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8674707/8521589/tan-2872918-small.gif","p":["Kai Tan received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China, in 2009, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Institute of Electronics, CAS, Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.","He is currently the Research Assistant with the Institute of Acoustics, CAS.

The RCM and the linear part of the range offset (RO) within SIMO data are corrected by employing a 3-D Stolt transformation. The residual range error is further compensated by phase multiplication and an image-domain interpolation. Reconstruction for a MIMO aperture can be achieved by adding together all the focusing results from its SIMO subarrays. The implementation details of the algorithm are described. The imaging resolution and the sampling requirements for a MIMO aperture are discussed. Since the RO correction is achieved by an approximate way, the spatial limitation for accurate reconstruction is also given. The imaging accuracy and the high efficiency of the algorithm are demonstrated both by simulations and experiments with various distributed targets based on planar MIMO arrays. Real-time 3-D imaging for planar SIMO/MIMO aperture is expected to be achieved by using the algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8674707/08521589.pdf","startPage":"2381","endPage":"2394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2872918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2872918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8674707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omega-K Algorithm for Near-Field 3-D Image Reconstruction Based on Planar SIMO/MIMO Array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","MIMO communication","Image reconstruction","Focusing","Arrays","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","interpolation","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar SIMO/MIMO aperture","near-field 3-D image reconstruction","planar SIMO/MIMO array","range cell migration","RCM","single-input-multiple-output bi-static geometry","multiple-input-multiple-output array","SIMO data","3-D Stolt transformation","residual range error","phase multiplication","image-domain interpolation","SIMO subarrays","imaging resolution","RO correction","imaging accuracy","planar MIMO arrays","range offset","omega-k algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D imaging","bi-static","multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)","Omega-K (\u03c9K)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Omega-K Algorithm for Near-Field 3-D Image Reconstruction Based on Planar SIMO/MIMO Array","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8521589/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18547525","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4172066"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501424, 61431020 and 61531018"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFF0107703"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Pillar Program during the Twelfth Five Year Plan Period","grantNumber":"2014BAK12B03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Omega-K Algorithm for Near-Field 3-D Image Reconstruction Based on Planar SIMO/MIMO Array","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tan-2872918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111284S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8674707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8674707","articleId":"8521589","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8521593,"authors":[{"name":"Ron Levie","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8541135/8521593/levie-2879624-small.gif","p":["Ron Levie received the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics (\nsumma cum laude) from Tel Aviv University, Aviv, Israel, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics\n that year.

The electrical energy consumption in India is the third biggest after China and USA with 5.5% global share in 2016. The per person energy use rate in India is closer to 0.7 KW. India's share with global energy demand will rise to 9% by 2035. Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging field and IoT based devices have created a revolution in electronics and IT. The foremost objective of this project is to create awareness about energy consumption and efficient use of home appliances for energy savings. Due to manual work, our existing electricity billing system has major drawbacks. This system gives the information on meter reading, power cut and the alert systems for producing an alarm when energy consumption exceeds beyond the specified limit using IoT. This idea is being implemented to reduce the human dependency to collect the monthly reading and minimize the technical problems regarding billing process. This project extends the design and implementation of an energy monitoring system with the pre-intimation of power agenda using Arduino micro controller and a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) module. The advantage of this system is that a user can understand the power consumed by the electrical appliances on the daily basis and can take further steps to control them and thus help in energy conservation. From the electricity board section, the information regarding the bill amount, payment and the pre-planned power shut down details are communicated to the consumer. If the customer does not pay the bill in time, the user is informed through a message. If still the customer does not pay the bill, then as per designated consideration, one alert message will be sent then automatically power connection is disconnected from the remote server. In the already existing smart energy meter, it shows the energy consumed by the appliances from the date of installation of the energy meter and its corresponding rupees. In this proposed energy meter, the meter gives the energy consumed on daily basis, its corresponding rupees, billing details and payment using IoT. Additionally, it has the main objective of giving the preintimation of power schedule and an alert system for producing an alarm when the energy consumption exceeds beyond the certain limit. It also has the facility of terminating the power supply when the residents are out of station to minimize the wastage of energy. This system not only reduces the power cut issues and the labor cost for noticing the residential energy consumption in regular intervals but also increases the energy conservation with the help of alarm systems and the energy meter accuracy by reducing the billing error and the cost of maintenance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Feb. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521650/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18245445","publicationDate":"February 2018","conferenceDate":"22-23 Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521650/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Smart Energy Meter Surveillance Using IoT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Energy Meter Surveillance Using IoT","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP-038-190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040602S","chronDate":"22-23 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501352","isNumber":"8521560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501352","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8521560","articleId":"8521650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":8521659,"authors":[{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["Department of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8738925/8521659/liu-2879513-small.gif","p":["Li Liu received the B.S. degree in Internet of Things engineering from Hohai University, Nanjing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Internet of Things Engineering.","His current research interests include wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, and machine learning."]},"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-0730-9230","id":"37085646409"},{"name":"Sammy Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8738925/8521659/chan-2879513-small.gif","p":["Sammy Chan (S\u201987\u2013M\u201989) received the B.E. and M.Eng.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, in 1988 and 1990, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne, in 1995.","From 1989 to 1994, he was with Telecom Australia Research Noratories, Melbourne, first as a Research Engineer, and from 1992 to 1994 as a Senior Research Engineer and a Project Leader.

However, mainstream cloud systems always require high network bandwidth and cannot satisfy the delay requirement of real-time applications. Therefore, a new paradigm called multiaccess edge computing has emerged to offload the computation and storage needs of end user devices to the edge cloud servers located in the radio access networks of 5G mobile networks. In this paper, we study and compare three load sharing schemes, namely, no sharing, random sharing, and least loaded sharing, which exploit the collaboration between clustered servers in different degrees. We develop computationally efficient analytical models to evaluate the performance of these schemes. These models are validated by simulation, and then used to compare the performances of the three load sharing schemes under various system parameters. Comparison results show that the least loaded sharing scheme is most suitable to fully exploit the collaboration between the servers and achieve load balance among them. It contributes to reducing the blocking probability and waiting time experienced by users.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2879513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2879513","endPage":"4888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8738925/08521659.pdf","startPage":"4880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Modeling of Representative Load Sharing Schemes for Clustered Servers in Multiaccess Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521659/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Modeling of Representative Load Sharing Schemes for Clustered Servers in Multiaccess Edge Computing","volume":"6","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"18758005","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8521659/","publicationDate":"June 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Innovation and Technology Fund from the Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"9443004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572172 and 61872124"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China\u2013Guangdong Joint Fund","grantNumber":"U180120020"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2016B10714"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"XYDXXJS-007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Modeling of Representative Load Sharing Schemes for Clustered Servers in Multiaccess Edge Computing","sourcePdf":"jiot-chan-2879513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14154S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8738925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8738925","articleId":"8521659","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8521668,"authors":[{"name":"Nurzaman Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8614370/8521668/ahmed-2879579-small.gif","p":["Nurzaman Ahmed was born in Dhupdhara, India.

A good impedance matching performance can be obtained by well distributing the resonant frequencies of slotline radiator and dual-mode resonator. Under common-mode operation, the differential antenna does not work because the vertical electrical field is hardly introduced on the slotline radiator. Furthermore, four filtering antenna elements are distributed centrosymmetrically along the center of the substrate. The adjacent two filtering antenna elements are placed perpendicularly with a spacing of 0.05\u03bbA. Compared with the single filtering antenna, a filtering performance of the MIMO antenna has no significant change. For demonstration, a MIMO differential filtering antenna is simulated and measured, which has a fractional bandwidth of 25% at 5.2 GHz. The simulated results agree well with measured ones. A low mutual coupling of less than -16 dB and low envelope correlation coefficient of better than 0.01 are obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closely Spaced Broadband MIMO Differential Filtering Slotline Antenna With CM Suppression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2018.2879523","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/8552698/08521671.pdf","startPage":"2498","endPage":"2502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2018.2879523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8552698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521671/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Closely Spaced Broadband MIMO Differential Filtering Slotline Antenna With CM Suppression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8521671/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18285365","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501232"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"NJ20160012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011421","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves","grantNumber":"K201716"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closely Spaced Broadband MIMO Differential Filtering Slotline Antenna With CM Suppression","sourcePdf":"lawp-deng-2879523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05114S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"8552698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8552698","articleId":"8521671","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8521672,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo E.

This article discusses these recent protection requirements and their intent and potential practical effects as well as how to ensure that the protection this language seeks to provide is included in the electrical power distribution system.","doi":"10.1109/MIAS.2018.2868354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIAS.2018.2868354","startPage":"53","endPage":"63","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/2943/8568996/08521672.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8568996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arc Flash in the National Electrical Code: Do Articles 240.87 and 240.67 Achieve Their Intent and Goals?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Arc Flash in the National Electrical Code: Do Articles 240.87 and 240.67 Achieve Their Intent and Goals?","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18341664","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8521672/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc Flash in the National Electrical Code: Do Articles 240.87 and 240.67 Achieve Their Intent and Goals?","sourcePdf":"25mias01-valdes-2868354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104147S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"2943","isNumber":"8568996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8568996","articleId":"8521672","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"\u00a9ISTOCKPHOTO.COM/IDEALISTOCKIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":8521678,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0002-0187-1970","id":"37086542682"},{"name":"Aihuang Guo","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Aihuang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37584022500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8521678","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Resource management","Array signal processing","Interference","Channel allocation","MIMO communication","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","concave programming","convex programming","energy conservation","MIMO communication","quality of service","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless backhaul","weighted summation","nonconvex problem","massive MIMO heterogeneous networks","massive MIMO HetNet","energy efficiency evaluation framework","energy efficient resource allocation","spectral efficiency evaluation framework","quality-of-service","interference mitigation","novel alternating optimization algorithm","Lagrange dual","successive convex approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","resource allocation","spectral efficiency","heterogeneous networks","wireless backhaul"]}],"abstract":"This letter provides a spectral and energy efficiency evaluation framework for massive MIMO heterogeneous networks with wireless backhaul.

The basic method to repair faulty TSVs (FTSVs) is to transfer the signals on FTSVs through regular TSVs. Many redundant TSV (RTSV) structures have been proposed to repair uniformly distributed FTSVs. For clustering FTSVs, a router-based RTSV structure appears to be a good scheme. But it is not an economical method, since the structure consumes many more hardware resources than normal structures. In this paper, we propose a cellular-based RTSV structure to utilize hardware resources more efficiently for a higher yield. We propose a corresponding algorithm for recovery-route searching. Simulation results show that for 1E6 TSVs and a TSV failure rate of 0.01%, our design consumes only 4.5% more area of all STSVs to achieve a yield above 99.9%. We compare our structure with several other designs and demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2876906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2876906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8628286/08521681.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Cellular-Based Redundant TSV Structure for Clustered Faults","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A New Cellular-Based Redundant TSV Structure for Clustered Faults","volume":"27","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521681/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18439119","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521681/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772331 and 61176037"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Cellular-Based Redundant TSV Structure for Clustered Faults","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jiang-2876906-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080919S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8628286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8628286","articleId":"8521681","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8521691,"authors":[{"name":"Sanchari Sen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/8709913/8521691/sen-2879434-small.gif","p":["Sanchari Sen received the BTech degree in electronics and electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India.

The enormous computational demand posed by DNNs is a key challenge for computing system designers and has most commonly been addressed through the design of DNN accelerators. However, these specialized accelerators utilize large quantities of multiply-accumulate units and on-chip memory and are prohibitive in area and cost constrained systems such as wearable devices and IoT sensors. In this work, we take a complementary approach and improve the performance of DNNs on general-purpose processor (GPP) cores. We do so by exploiting a key attribute of DNNs, viz. sparsity or the prevalence of zero values. We propose Sparsity-aware Core Extensions (SparCE) - a set of low-overhead micro-architectural and ISA extensions that dynamically detect whether an operand (e.g., the result of a load instruction) is zero and subsequently skip a set of future instructions that use it. To maximize performance benefits, SparCE ensures that the instructions to be skipped are prevented from even being fetched, as squashing instructions comes with a penalty (e.g., a pipeline stall). SparCE consists of 2 key micro-architectural enhancements. First, a Sparsity Register File (SpRF) is utilized to track registers that are zero. Next, a Sparsity-Aware Skip Address (SASA) Table is used to indicate instruction sequences that can be skipped, and to specify conditions on SpRF registers that trigger instruction skipping. When an instruction is fetched, SparCE dynamically pre-identifies whether the following instruction(s) can be skipped, and if so appropriately modifies the program counter, thereby skipping the redundant instructions and improving performance. We model SparCE using the gem5 architectural simulator, and evaluate our approach on 6 state-of-the-art image-recognition DNNs in the context of both training and inference using the Caffe deep learning framework. On a scalar microprocessor, SparCE achieves 1.11\u00d7-1.96\u00d7 speedups across both convolution and fully-connected layers that exhibit 10-90 percent sparsity.

Such package integration of 5G filters with ultrashort 3-D interconnects allows for low interconnect losses that are similar to that of on-chip filters, but low component insertion loss of off-chip discrete filters. These thin-film filters exhibit a cross-sectional height of 188.5 \u03bcm and can be utilized either as embedded components or integrated passive devices in module packages. Three topologies of LPF and BPF in total are modeled, designed, and fabricated on precision thin-film buildup layers on glass substrate as a core. Large-area panelcompatible semiadditive patterning (SAP) process is utilized to form high-precision topologies to aid the low-cost fabrication of ultraminiaturized filters. SAP also enables the realization of ultra-thin traces to precisely model high-impedance inductive lines compared to conventional subtractive etching and printing techniques. This results in filters with low insertion loss, low VSWR, and high selectivity. The simulated and measured results of filters show an excellent correlation.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2018.2876769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8542898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2018.2876769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8542898/08521699.pdf","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First Demonstration of Compact, Ultra-Thin Low-Pass and Bandpass Filters for 5G Small-Cell Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"First Demonstration of Compact, Ultra-Thin Low-Pass and Bandpass Filters for 5G Small-Cell Applications","volume":"28","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521699/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18306420","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521699/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First Demonstration of Compact, Ultra-Thin Low-Pass and Bandpass Filters for 5G Small-Cell Applications","sourcePdf":"lmwc-ali-2876769-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063397S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"8542898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8542898","articleId":"8521699","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8521700,"authors":[{"name":"Elizete G.

These applications involve techniques for forming and sharpening a short electrical pulse to achieve pulse compressors, frequency multipliers, phase shifters, and, in addition, radio frequency (RF) generation, holding, in this case, a great potential for replacing vacuum electron tubes with a low cost and fully solid-state technology. Based on the analysis of relevant experimental results of different types of NLTLs reported in the literature, this paper presents an investigation about the correlation between the performance limits of NLTLs and specific characteristics of the materials used in their construction, concluding that there is a pressing demand for the development of high-performance dielectric and magnetic materials with special characteristics such as highly nonlinear behavior, low losses at microwave frequencies, and thermal stability that would allow for an improvement in the performance of NLTLs, enabling their operation at higher frequencies and with better electrical-to-RF conversion efficiency. The achievement of a stable behavior over a broader operating temperature range would allow the application of NLTLs in military and aerospace devices.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2018.2876020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/27/8603849/08521700.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2018.2876020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8603849","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Constraints on Nonlinear Transmission Lines for RF Generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Practical Constraints on Nonlinear Transmission Lines for RF Generation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18385075","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8521700/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"SOARD-USAF","grantNumber":"FA9550-18-1-0111"},{"fundingName":"AFOSR-UNM","grantNumber":"FA9550-15-10094"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Constraints on Nonlinear Transmission Lines for RF Generation","sourcePdf":"tps-rangel-2876020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136951S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"8603849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8603849","articleId":"8521700","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8521706,"authors":[{"name":"Yimao Sun","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8561299/8521706/sun-2879622-small.gif","p":["Yimao Sun (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree from the School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2013.

The use of modified polar representation (MPR) for the source location enables the integration of the two estimators together and eliminates the knowledge needed if the source is in the near-field or far-field. The previous work on MPR only provides an iterative implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) initialized by a coarse semidefinite relaxation (SDR) solution. This paper proposes a formulation for time difference of arrival (TDOA) localization of a 2-D or 3-D source in MPR that would lead to a closed-form solution through the minimization of a quadratic function with a quadratic constraint. Two techniques, the successive unconstrained minimization (SUM) and the generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS), are applied to solve the optimization. Detailed analysis in the first order for mean-square and in the second order for estimation bias is performed for both methods. The theoretical results illustrate that the closed-form solution from each of the methods provides the Cramer-Rao lower bound performance for Gaussian noise. The GTRS solution has better accuracy than the SUM solution when the source signal is arriving at an azimuth or elevation angle close to zero, 90\u00b0, or 180\u00b0 or when the measurement noise level is large. They yield comparable performance with the MLE albeit having less complexity and avoiding possible divergence behavior. They outperform the closed-form solutions from the literature in angle estimation and have smaller bias.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2879622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2879622","startPage":"320","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8561299/08521706.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solution and Analysis of TDOA Localization of a Near or Distant Source in Closed Form","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Solution and Analysis of TDOA Localization of a Near or Distant Source in Closed Form","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18320830","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8521706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1533125, 61471153 and 61771108"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001022"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2015Z011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solution and Analysis of TDOA Localization of a Near or Distant Source in Closed Form","sourcePdf":"tsp-wan-2879622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156848S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8561299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8561299","articleId":"8521706","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8521867,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Montero Robina","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Autom\u00e1tica, Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad de Sevilla, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo Montero","lastName":"Robina","id":"37086508687"},{"name":"Francisco Gordillo","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Autom\u00e1tica, Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad de Sevilla, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Gordillo","id":"37299539200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4198-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4197-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4199-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-0165"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2469-8741"}],"articleNumber":"8521867","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Voltage control","Switches","Silicon","Maximum power point trackers","Modulation","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","maximum power point trackers","photovoltaic power systems","power control","power generation control","power grids","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid-interfacing solar arrays","five-level diode-clamped converters","grid-connected converter","proper power extraction","capacitor voltage controller","DC-DC stages","five-level DCC","maximum power point tracking algorithm","desired capacitor voltages","dc voltage","power controller","voltage imbalance","dc-link"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521867","doi":"10.1109/EPEPEMC.2018.8521867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPEMC.2018.8521867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521748","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 18th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 18th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490905/8521748/08521867.pdf","startPage":"955","endPage":"961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Controller for Grid-Interfacing Solar Arrays Through Five-Level Diode-Clamped Converters","abstract":"This paper presents an approach to control a grid-connected, five-level, diode-clamped converter (DCC) with solar arrays directly connected to each capacitor of the dc-link, On one hand, the control of such converters is challenging as the voltage imbalance among the capacitor may affect the power controller. On the other hand, when dealing with solar arrays, the dc voltage is a key point considering that the efficiency of the array highly depends on it. This article presents a solution where both aims are fulfilled: the desired capacitor voltages, set by the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm, are reached at the same time that these values are taken into account in the power controller. This is an unusual approach for five-level DCC that avoids the use of DC-DC stages, therefore it makes the system more affordable and avoids extra losses. Thanks to the capacitor voltage controller, proper power extraction from each solar array is achieved. The theoretical presentation of this approach is shown along with simulation results that validates its effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521867/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18248351","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Controller for Grid-Interfacing Solar Arrays Through Five-Level Diode-Clamped Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Controller for Grid-Interfacing Solar Arrays Through Five-Level Diode-Clamped Converters","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0955-nf-000744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074635S","chronDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490905","isNumber":"8521748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490905","xplore-issue":"8521748","articleId":"8521867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521873,"authors":[{"name":"Helmut L.

The switch-mode power amplifier is realized by a multicell amplifier with a passive LC-filter, which is actively damped by feeding back the capacitor current. The workload of the linear amplifier is influenced by the factors input frequency and load current which are examined in this paper.

Simulation results are presented showing the proposed operation of the converter and its features are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521915/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521915/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18220074","conferenceDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear MIMO Control of Interleaved Three-Port Boost Converter by Means of State-Feedback Linearization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear MIMO Control of Interleaved Three-Port Boost Converter by Means of State-Feedback Linearization","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0164-nf-001872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067477S","chronDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490905","isNumber":"8521748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490905","xplore-issue":"8521748","articleId":"8521915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8521930,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Luo","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086506640"},{"name":"Xuemei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37717144600"},{"name":"Haiping Wu","affiliation":["Sixth Business Division, BYD Col Ltd, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Haiping","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086328502"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4198-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4197-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4199-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-0165"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2469-8741"}],"articleNumber":"8521930","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Optimization","Reliability","Electric vehicles","Linear programming","Junctions","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","energy consumption","insulated gate bipolar transistors","Pareto optimisation","power semiconductor switches","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization design","electric vehicle converters","EV converters","EV driving cycles","multiobjective optimization problem","fierce competition","specific energy consumption","customized design method","electric vehicle driver system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521930","abstract":"Converter is a key component of electric vehicles (EVs) driver system. With the increasing fierce competition in the market, maximizing the efficiency and reliability, and reducing the costs of EV converters are more and more critical for EVs manufactures.

In this paper, first, a multidimensional function with the objectives of specific energy consumption \u03b5, mean time to first failure \u03b3 and specific cost \u03c3 is established under the EV driving cycles.

On this basis, the best trade-off between loss, reliability and cost of the EV converters, which provides a new routine for the design of the converters, is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/EPEPEMC.2018.8521930","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490905/8521748/08521930.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"279","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 18th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC)","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 18th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPEMC.2018.8521930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization Design of Electric Vehicle Converters Based on <tex>$\\varepsilon-\\gamma-\\sigma$</tex>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization Design of Electric Vehicle Converters Based on <tex>$\\varepsilon-\\gamma-\\sigma$</tex>","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18248343","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521930/","conferenceDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimization Design of Electric Vehicle Converters Based on <tex>$\\varepsilon-\\gamma-\\sigma$</tex>","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0274-nf-004766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087117S","chronDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490905","isNumber":"8521748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490905","xplore-issue":"8521748","articleId":"8521930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8521939,"authors":[{"name":"Tamas Kokenyesi","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Tamas","lastName":"Kokenyesi","id":"37074250200"},{"name":"Marton Hegedus","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Marton","lastName":"Hegedus","id":"37086507853"},{"name":"Szabolcs Vereb","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Szabolcs","lastName":"Vereb","id":"37086508596"},{"name":"Attila Balogh","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Attila","lastName":"Balogh","id":"38191532700"},{"name":"Zoltan Suto","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zoltan","lastName":"Suto","id":"37271156800"},{"name":"Istvan Varjasi","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Istvan","lastName":"Varjasi","id":"37563771300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4198-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4197-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4199-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-0165"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2469-8741"}],"articleNumber":"8521939","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Pins","Sliding mode control","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth","Modulation","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital-analogue conversion","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-in-the loop simulation","logic design","power electronics","sigma-delta modulation","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bitstream DAC architecture","output analogue filter model","power electronics","FPGA-driven DAC","hardware-in-the-loop simulators","FPGA technology","fast HIL simulators","control software","analogue signals","FPGA-synthesizable solution","second order sliding mode control","pin-effective digital-to-analogue converters"]}],"abstract":"The advances in FPGA technology have enabled to develop fast HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) simulators, revolutionizing control software and hardware development for power electronics. HIL simulators should reproduce the same analogue signals that could be measured on real main circuits. A very common limitation in these applications is the usable pin count of the FPGA, therefore using the most pin-effective Digital-to-Analogue Converters (DACs) becomes critical. \u03a3 - \u0394 DACs provide a simple, FPGA-synthesizable solution using a single pin for each output, but the output signal's bandwidth and latency is usually not sufficient, because of the required analogue filters. Higher order \u03a3 - \u0394 DACs usually perform much better in the aspect of the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) but not the usable bandwidth. This paper introduces a new bitstream DAC architecture based on the sliding mode control of the output analogue filter model. It is optimized mainly to reproduce current transducer signals in power electronics (usually triangle waves), which can be done more accurately than traditional \u03a3 - \u0394 solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Driven DAC with Second Order Sliding Mode Control of Filter Model for Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulators","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 18th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC)","doi":"10.1109/EPEPEMC.2018.8521939","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 18th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490905/8521748/08521939.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPEMC.2018.8521939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8521748","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Driven DAC with Second Order Sliding Mode Control of Filter Model for Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulators","conferenceDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8521939/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18248284","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Driven DAC with Second Order Sliding Mode Control of Filter Model for Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulators","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0824-nf-003611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07196S","chronDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490905","isNumber":"8521748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8521748","articleId":"8521939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8521959,"authors":[{"name":"Elif Selin Durak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Elif Selin","lastName":"Durak","id":"37085689853"},{"name":"Halil Ibrahim Okumus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Halil Ibrahim","lastName":"Okumus","id":"37713586900"},{"name":"Mehmet Ali Usta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet Ali","lastName":"Usta","id":"38235295400"},{"name":"Hakan Kahveci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"Kahveci","id":"37072917000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4198-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4197-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4199-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-0165"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2469-8741"}],"articleNumber":"8521959","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8521959","abstract":"This paper presents a heuristic approach to overcome the harmonic elimination problem in multilevel inverters.

To ensure a well damped system behaviour at low losses, an active damping scheme based on filter capacitor feedback is used. Unfortunately, the nonlinear DC-Bias dependent capacitance of the used ceramic capacitors (X7R is used to minimize filter volume) significantly affects the active damping. A symmetrical filter structure sufficiently reduces the capacitors voltage dependency. However, the paper shows that the symmetrical structure also causes negative effects in respective to the filters noise suppression performance. Modifications in the filter topology are reported and analyzed for reducing the impaired noise suppression. The proposed filter scheme finally results in a well damped system behaviour fulfilling established EMC standards according output noise demonstrated by experimental results of a 2 kW/400 V laboratory prototype.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8521984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8521984/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18248264","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a Two-Stage Actively Damped LC Filter for GaN/SiC Motor Inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a Two-Stage Actively Damped LC Filter for GaN/SiC Motor Inverters","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0177-nf-000574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048349S","chronDate":"26-30 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490905","isNumber":"8521748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490905","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8521748","articleId":"8521984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8521987,"authors":[{"name":"Pratibha Naganathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Pratibha","lastName":"Naganathan","id":"37086507228"},{"name":"Srirama Srinivas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Srirama","lastName":"Srinivas","id":"37588110600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4198-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4197-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4199-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-0165"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2469-8741"}],"articleNumber":"8521987","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"abstract":"A novel Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) based Direct Torque Control (DTC) scheme is proposed in this paper, for a two-level inverter fed Induction Motor (IM) drive, suited for Electric Vehicle (EV) applications. In the EV applications, reference torque is slowly varied, which opens up the option to control the flux reference in order to incorporate MTPA condition, facilitating improvement in IM efficiency. Firstly, flux reference changes needed to realize MTPA condition are derived in synchronous reference frame and then appropriately translated to the stationary reference frame so as to be adopted for DTC for controlling both torque and flux in the IM. With this relation, an MTPA controller is designed along with a feedback-linearizing controller. The performance of the IM with the proposed MTPA based DTC is tested initially for smooth varying torque reference and results are presented that clearly demonstrates a much lower current drawn from the inverter drive when compared with the use of conventional DTC scheme. This may lead to improved energy savings. To ascertain the benefits obtainable with the envisaged MTPA based DTC scheme for EV applications, the motor drive is tested and experimental results are presented with the European Union (EU) urban drive cycle data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Stators","Induction motors","Rotors","Inverters","Traction motors","Synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

By quantifying the residual interference with a fractional error factor (FEF), we show that NOMA cannot always perform better than orthogonal multiple access (OMA) especially under certain receiver sensitivity and FEF levels. Assuming the existence of an offline/online ICI management scheme, the proposed solution accounts for the ICI which is shown to deteriorate the NOMA performance particularly when it becomes significant compared to the ICRI. Then, a distributed cluster formation (CF) and power-bandwidth allocation (PBA) approach are proposed for downlink heterogeneous networks (HetNets) operating on the imperfect NOMA. We develop a hierarchically distributed solution methodology, where BSs independently form clusters and distributively determine the power-bandwidth allowance of each cluster. A generic CF scheme is obtained by creating a multi-partite graph via partitioning user equipment with respect to their channel gains since NOMA performance is primarily determined by the channel gain disparity of cluster members. A sequential weighted bi-partite matching method is proposed for solving the resulted weighted multi-partite matching problem. Thereafter, we present a hierarchically distributed PBA approach which consists of the primary master, secondary masters, and slave problems. For a given cluster power and bandwidth pair, optimal power allocations and Lagrange multipliers of slave problems are derived in closed-form. While power allowance of clusters is updated by the secondary masters based on dual variables of slave problems, bandwidth proportions of clusters are iteratively allocated by the primary master as per the utility achieved by the secondary masters at the previous iteration. Finally, the proposed CF and PBA approaches under the operation of imperfect NOMA are investigated and compared to the OMA scheme by extensive simulations results in DL-HetNets.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2879508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2879508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08522014.pdf","startPage":"1677","endPage":"1692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Cluster Formation and Power-Bandwidth Allocation for Imperfect NOMA in DL-HetNets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Cluster Formation and Power-Bandwidth Allocation for Imperfect NOMA in DL-HetNets","volume":"67","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8522014/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18467836","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8522014/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"8-1545-2-657"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Cluster Formation and Power-Bandwidth Allocation for Imperfect NOMA in DL-HetNets","sourcePdf":"tcomm-celik-2879508-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146162S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8522014","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8522021,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiying Xiang","affiliation":["State Key Discipline Laboratory of Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Technology, School of Microelectronics, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/8471004/8522021/xiang-2879484-small.gif","p":["Shuiying Xiang was born in Ji\u2019an, China, in 1986.

The rapid advancement of IoT big data has provided valuable opportunities for the development of people in all areas of society. At the same time, it has also brought severe challenges to various types of current information processing systems. Effectively using the big data technology, discovering the hidden laws in big data, tapping the potential value of big data, and predicting the development trend of things to allocate resources more reasonably will promote the overall development of society. However, most of the IoT big data are presented as heterogeneous data, with high dimensions, different forms of expression, and a lot of redundant information. The current machine learning model works in vector space, which makes it impossible to gain big data features because vectors cannot simulate the highly nonlinear distribution of IoT big data. This paper presents a deep learning calculation model called tensor deep learning (TDL), which further improves big data feature learning and high-level feature fusion. It uses tensors to model the complexity of multisource heterogeneous data and extends the vector space data to the tensor space, when feature extraction in the tensor space is included. To fully understand the underlying data distribution, the tensor distance is adopted as the average square sum error term of the output layer reconstruction error. Based on the conventional back-propagation algorithm, this study proposes a high-order back-propagation algorithm to extend the data from the linear space to multiple linear space and train the parameters of the proposed model. Then, to evaluate its performance, the proposed TDL model is compared with the stacked auto encoder and the multimodal deep learning model. Furthermore, experiments are performed on two representative datasets, namely CUAVE and STL-10. Experimental results show that the proposed model not only excels in heterogeneous data fusion but also provides a higher recognition accuracy than the conventional deep learning model or the multimodal learning model for big data.","doi":"10.1109/TETCI.2018.2876568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/7433297/8964514/08522024.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETCI.2018.2876568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8964514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor Deep Learning Model for Heterogeneous Data Fusion in Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8522024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Tensor Deep Learning Model for Heterogeneous Data Fusion in Internet of Things","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","accessionNumber":"19282821","htmlLink":"/document/8522024/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Youth Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501326 and 61401310"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61731006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271411"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology","grantNumber":"15JCZDJC31500"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin Science Foundation","grantNumber":"16JCYBJC16500"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin Higher Education Creative Team Funds Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor Deep Learning Model for Heterogeneous Data Fusion in Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tetci-wang-2876568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092182S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7433297","isNumber":"8964514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7433297","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8964514","articleId":"8522024","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8522027,"authors":[{"name":"Tiancheng Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Tiancheng","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-0499-5135","id":"37070584300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8522027","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8522027","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Sensors","Estimation","Geometry","Markov processes","Modeling","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","least squares approximations","Markov processes","nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unscented Kalman filtering","single-road-constrained positioning","deterministic trajectory geometry","single-road-constrained estimation problem","trajectory curve","reduced state dimension","Markov transition model","weighted least square fitting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian estimation","mobile positioning","constrained filtering","least squares fitting"]}],"abstract":"We consider the single-road-constrained estimation problem for positioning a target that moves on a single, deterministic, and exactly known trajectory.

Spotting micro-expression means to locate the moment when the micro-expression happens, which is a primary step for micro-expression recognition. Previous work in micro-expression spotting focus on spotting micro-expression from short video, and with hand-crafted features. In this paper, we present a methodology for spotting micro-expression from long videos. Specifically, a new convolutional neural network named spotting micro-expression convolutional network was designed for extracting features from video clips, which is the first time that deep learning is used in micro-expression spotting. Then, a feature matrix processing method was proposed for spotting the apex frame from long video, which uses a sliding window and takes the characteristics of micro-expression into account to search the apex frame. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a better performance than the existing state-of-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08522030.pdf","startPage":"71143","endPage":"71151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8522030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SMEConvNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for Spotting Spontaneous Facial Micro-Expression From Long Videos","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8522030/","displayDocTitle":"SMEConvNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for Spotting Spontaneous Facial Micro-Expression From Long Videos","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8522030/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18584927","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301297 and 61502398"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG) under project Cross Modal Learning","grantNumber":"NSFC 6162113608/DFG TRR-169"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"SMEConvNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for Spotting Spontaneous Facial Micro-Expression From Long Videos","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2879485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097132S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8522030","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8522034,"authors":[{"name":"Xumin Huang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8522034/huang-2879578-small.gif","p":["Xumin Huang is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in networked control systems with the Guangdong University of Technology, China.

Usually, the generalization of VEC involves large-scale deployment of dedicated servers, which will cause tremendous economic expense. We also observe that the Parked Vehicles (PVs) in addition to mobile vehicles have rich and underutilized resources for task execution in vehicular networks. Thus, we consider scheduling PVs as available edge computing nodes to execute tasks, and this leads to a new computing paradigm, called by parked vehicle edge computing (PVEC). In this paper, we investigate PVEC and explore opportunistic resources from PVs to run distributed mobile applications. PVs coordinate with VEC servers for collective task execution. First, a system architecture with primary network entities is proposed for enabling PVEC. We also elaborately design an interactive protocol to support mutual communications among them with security guarantee. Moreover, we measure the availability of opportunistic resources and formulate a resource scheduling optimization problem by using Stackelberg game approach. A subgradient-based iterative algorithm is presented to determine workload allocation among PVs and minimize the overall cost of users. Numerical results indicate that compared with existing schemes, PVEC serves more vehicles and reduces service fee for users. We also demonstrate that the Stackelberg game approach is effective and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08522034.pdf","startPage":"66649","endPage":"66663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879578","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8522034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parked Vehicle Edge Computing: Exploiting Opportunistic Resources for Distributed Mobile Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8522034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Parked Vehicle Edge Computing: Exploiting Opportunistic Resources for Distributed Mobile Applications","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8522034/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422201, 61370159, 61503083, 61701122 and U1301255"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2015B010129001 and 2016A030313734"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China","grantNumber":"201804010238"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Parked Vehicle Edge Computing: Exploiting Opportunistic Resources for Distributed Mobile Applications","sourcePdf":"access-yu-2879578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105393S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8522034","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8522039,"authors":[{"name":"Munsuk Kim","affiliation":["National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Munsuk","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0003-4145-8918","id":"37086073317"},{"name":"Tanguy Ropitault","affiliation":["National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Tanguy","lastName":"Ropitault","id":"37660249200"},{"name":"Sukyoung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sukyoung","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-3497-3295","id":"37085378319"},{"name":"Nada Golmie","affiliation":["National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nada","lastName":"Golmie","id":"37270202800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8522039","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":812},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8522039","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Training","MIMO communication","Receiving antennas","Antenna feeds","Radio frequency","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","directive antennas","MIMO communication","protocols","transmitting antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MU-MIMO beamforming training","appropriate directional antenna patterns","MU-MIMO BFT","efficient MU-MIMO beamforming protocol","multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output system","transmitting antenna","IEEE 802.11ay WLAN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MU-MIMO","beamforming training","802.11ay"]}],"abstract":"IEEE 802.11ay supports multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO).

Both analytic and simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the training time.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2879476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2879476","startPage":"144","endPage":"147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8605392/08522039.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient MU-MIMO Beamforming Protocol for IEEE 802.11ay WLANs","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4234/8605392/8522039-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8522039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Efficient MU-MIMO Beamforming Protocol for IEEE 802.11ay WLANs","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18392444","pubMedId":"31274976","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8522039/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1A2B4002000"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Efficient MU-MIMO Beamforming Protocol for IEEE 802.11ay WLANs","sourcePdf":"lcomm-lee-2879476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076369S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8605392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8605392","articleId":"8522039","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8522043,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Beirami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ahmad Beirami is a research scientist at Electronic Arts Digital Platform \u2013 Data & AI, leading fundamental research and development on training AI agents in multi-agent systems.

The guesswork is central to several applications in information theory: average guesswork provides a lower bound on the expected computational cost of a sequential decoder to decode successfully the transmitted message; the complementary cumulative distribution function of guesswork gives the error probability in list decoding; the logarithm of guesswork is the number of bits needed in optimal lossless one-to-one source coding; and the guesswork is the number of trials required of an adversary to breach a password protected system in a brute-force attack. In this paper, we consider memoryless string sources that generate strings consisting of independent and identically distributed characters drawn from a finite alphabet, and characterize their corresponding guesswork. Our main tool is the tilt operation on a memoryless string source. We show that the tilt operation on a memoryless string source parametrizes an exponential family of memoryless string sources, which we refer to as the tilted family of the string source. We provide an operational meaning to the tilted families by proving that two memoryless string sources result in the same guesswork on all strings of all lengths if and only if their respective categorical distributions belong to the same tilted family. Establishing some general properties of the tilt operation, we generalize the notions of weakly typical set and asymptotic equipartition property to tilted weakly typical sets of different orders. We use this new definition to characterize the large deviations for all atypical strings and characterize the volume of tilted weakly typical sets of different orders. We subsequently build on this characterization to prove large deviation bounds on guesswork and provide an accurate approximation of its probability mass function.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8694135/8522043-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8522043/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","volume":"65","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2019","accessionNumber":"18617008","publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8522043/","displayDocTitle":"A Characterization of Guesswork on Swiftly Tilting Curves","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA 9550-14-1-043 and FA 9550-13-1-0076 A"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1527270"},{"fundingName":"Netapp through a Faculty Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Characterization of Guesswork on Swiftly Tilting Curves","sourcePdf":"tit-beirami-2879477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128845S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8694135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8694135","articleId":"8522043","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":8522048,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed","affiliation":["Data61, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8639028/8522048/ahmed-2879616-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed received the M.S. degree in information technology from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea, in 2014.

In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated, which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets.

These techniques introduce simplifying assumptions that preclude exploration of unknown mechanical properties with potential diagnostic value. We previously reported a data-driven approach to elasticity imaging using artificial neural networks (NNs) that circumvents limitations associated with model-based inverse methods. NN constitutive models can learn stress-strain behavior from force-displacement measurements using the autoprogressive (AutoP) method without prior assumptions of the underlying constitutive model. However, information about internal structure was required. We invented Cartesian NN constitutive models (CaNNCMs) that learn the spatial variations of material properties. We are presenting the first implementation of CaNNCMs trained with AutoP to develop data-driven models of 2-D linear-elastic materials. Both simulated and experimental force-displacement data were used as input to AutoP to show that CaNNCMs are able to model both continuous and discrete material property distributions with no prior information of internal object structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CaNNCMs are robust to measurement noise and can reconstruct reasonably accurate Young's modulus images from a sparse sampling of measurement data. CaNNCMs are an important step toward clinical use of data-driven elasticity imaging using AutoP.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8704227/08522049.pdf","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2018.2879495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2879495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8704227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8522049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Elasticity Imaging Using Cartesian Neural Network Constitutive Models and the Autoprogressive Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strain","Stress","Material properties","Displacement measurement","Artificial neural networks","Young's modulus","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["displacement measurement","elasticity","finite element analysis","force measurement","inverse problems","materials science computing","neural nets","stress-strain relations","Young's modulus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["experimental force-displacement data","force-displacement measurements","Young's modulus images","2-D linear-elastic materials","continuous material property distribution","discrete material property distribution","stress-strain behavior","simulated force-displacement data","internal object structure","sparse sampling","Cartesian NN constitutive models","model-based inverse methods","artificial neural networks","data-driven approach","potential diagnostic value","unknown mechanical properties","mechanical parameters","model-based mathematical inverse methods","quasistatic elasticity imaging techniques","autoprogressive method","Cartesian neural network constitutive models","data-driven elasticity imaging","measurement data","discrete material property distributions","continuous material property distributions","linear-elastic materials","data-driven models","AutoP","CaNNCMs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","elastography","finite element analysis","inverse problems"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Databases, Factual","Elastic Modulus","Elasticity Imaging Techniques","Finite Element Analysis","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Neural Networks, Computer","Phantoms, Imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8522049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Elasticity Imaging Using Cartesian Neural Network Constitutive Models and the Autoprogressive Method","volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8522049/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18635993","pubMedId":"30403625","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007316","fundingName":"Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute","grantNumber":"R01 CA168575 and R21 EB023402"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Elasticity Imaging Using Cartesian Neural Network Constitutive Models and the Autoprogressive Method","sourcePdf":"tmi-hoerig-2879495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099895S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8704227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8704227","articleId":"8522049","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8522055,"authors":[{"name":"Keqi Mei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9321228/8522055/mei-2875267-small.gif","p":["Keqi Mei was born in Changzhou, China, in 1993.

The proposed SOSM controller design involves two steps. First, a Lyapunov-based SOSM controller is developed by using the adding a power integrator technique to locally finite-time stabilize the sliding variables. Second, by combining the local SOSM controller with a saturation function, a novel SOSM controller with a saturation level is constructed. The feature of the new SOSM controller lies in that the saturation level can be tuned not only to guarantee the global convergence but also to improve the dynamic performance. Lyapunov analysis has been utilized to test the finite-time stability of the closed-loop sliding mode dynamics. The proposed method is eventually demonstrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2875267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/9321228/08522055.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2018.2875267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9321228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second-Order Sliding Mode Controller Design Subject to an Upper-Triangular Structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8522055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8522055/","displayDocTitle":"Second-Order Sliding Mode Controller Design Subject to an Upper-Triangular Structure","volume":"51","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2021","accessionNumber":"20287032","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8522055/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573170 and 31571571"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"BK20180045"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"XNYQC-006"},{"fundingName":"PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-Order Sliding Mode Controller Design Subject to an Upper-Triangular Structure","sourcePdf":"tsmc-ding-2875267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101362S","chronDate":"Jan.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9321228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"9321228","articleId":"8522055","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8523637,"authors":[{"name":"Xianjun Xia","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/8720290/8523637/xia-2879750-small.gif","p":["Xianjun Xia received the bachelor's degree in electronic engineering from the Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2011, and the master's degree in signal and information processing from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2014.

To deal with this, this paper proposes generating the virtual training data categorically using the auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks. Soft labels of acoustic events are first calculated to represent the acoustic event localization information. The closer the current frame is to the middle of the manually labeled acoustic event, the higher the soft label will be, which makes the soft labels positively correlated with the acoustic event localization. Then, the acoustic event class and the quantized soft labels are used as the input condition to the auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks to generate an arbitrary number of training samples.

Currently, there is a bottleneck in the amount of enough annotated data for training robust acoustic models, as hand-annotating time-synchronized chord labels requires professional musical skills and considerable labor. To cope with this limitation, in this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep feature extractor, which is trained on a large set of time, synchronized musical instrument digital interface audio data pairs and can robustly estimate pitch class activations of real-world music audio recordings. The CNN feature extractor plus a bidirectional long short-term memory conditional random field decoding model forms the proposed hybrid system for automatic chord recognition. Experiments show that the proposed model is compatible for both regular major/minor triad chord classification and larger vocabulary chord recognition, and outperforms other state-of-the-art chord recognition systems.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2018.2879399","startPage":"355","endPage":"366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8552740/08523662.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2018.2879399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8552740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Audio Chord Recognition With MIDI-Trained Deep Feature and BLSTM-CRF Sequence Decoding Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Hidden Markov models","Music","Decoding","Training","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","audio signal processing","convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","music","random processes","recurrent neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic audio chord recognition","MIDI-trained deep feature","machine learning technologies","data-driven feature extraction","automatic chord recognition tasks","hand-annotating time-synchronized chord labels","convolutional neural network","deep feature extractor","real-world music audio recordings","CNN feature extractor","musical instrument digital interface","chord recognition systems","BLSTM-CRF sequence decoding model","chord classification","bidirectional long short-term memory conditional random field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic chord recognition","bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)","conditional random fields (CRF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Audio Chord Recognition With MIDI-Trained Deep Feature and BLSTM-CRF Sequence Decoding Model","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8523662/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18285322","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671156"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Audio Chord Recognition With MIDI-Trained Deep Feature and BLSTM-CRF Sequence Decoding Model","sourcePdf":"taslp-li-2879399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169841S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8552740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8552740","articleId":"8523662","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8523665,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Towson University, Towson, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8523665/yu-2879760-small.gif","p":["Wei Yu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, China, in 1992, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Texas A&M University in 2008.

Nonetheless, too often, the communication infrastructures that enable time-critical information delivery become dysfunctional, due to traffic overloads or physical damage. Thus, the user-side solution [e.g., device-to-device (D2D) communications] and the network-side solution [e.g., dynamic wireless networks (DWNs)] are essential communication techniques that can enhance or restore communication for responders and victims in the harsh environment associated with public safety scenes. While D2D has been widely studied and investigated in legacy/commercial communication networks, as well as DWN, little work has been done toward adapting D2D and DWN from a public safety perspective. In this survey, we first design a layered structure, consisting of the public safety service layer, time-critical information delivery layer, and physical object layer, from which to consider the public safety system and its key components. We then extensively review research efforts on both D2D and DWN as complimentary user-side and network-side communication techniques toward effective public safety communications. Particularly, we investigate the approaches and standardization progress of D2D and DWN for public safety communications. Finally, we provide insights into challenges and potential solutions regarding D2D, DWN, security and resilience, and performance evaluation of public safety communication, as well as the integration of state-of-the-art communication and computing technologies to further improve time-critical information delivery in various public safety scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879760","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08523665.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"70397","endPage":"70425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey of Public Safety Communications: User-Side and Network-Side Solutions and Future Directions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8523665","topic":"Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Survey of Public Safety Communications: User-Side and Network-Side Solutions and Future Directions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523665/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8523665/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18584928","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Survey of Public Safety Communications: User-Side and Network-Side Solutions and Future Directions","sourcePdf":"access-yu-2879760-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.279066S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications"],"articleId":"8523665","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8523672,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando G.

As a minimum requirement to be considered robust, a network must remain connected after any single node or link failure, so that each node is able to communicate with all other nodes. It turns out that some national optical backbones do not satisfy this condition, the Chilean Internet backbone being an example. To solve this problem, it is needed the addition of link(s) to the network, which can usually be done in different ways, leaving room to do that while minimizing other metrics of interest. This letter discusses metrics to evaluate the robustness of such networks (specifically, edge betweenness centrality, the number of link cutsets, and node Wiener impact) and proposes a variable neighborhood search heuristic to improve it by adding a few well-placed links. As a case of study, results are presented for the Chilean Internet backbone, considering three and four extra links.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2879641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2879641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8605392/08523672.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"47","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring and Improving Network Robustness: A Chilean Case Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Measuring and Improving Network Robustness: A Chilean Case Study","volume":"23","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8523672/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18392452","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523672/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009465","fundingName":"Corporaci\u00f3n de Fomento de la Producci\u00f3n","grantNumber":"15BPE-47225"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico","grantNumber":"462477/2014-2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring and Improving Network Robustness: A Chilean Case Study","sourcePdf":"lcomm-paiva-2879641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094754S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8605392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8605392","articleId":"8523672","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8523675,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Xu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086304781"},{"name":"Wen-Qin Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Qin","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-4466-9585","id":"37085671601"},{"name":"Ronghua Gui","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ronghua","lastName":"Gui","id":"37086243986"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8523675","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":874},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Direction-of-arrival estimation","US Department of Defense","Estimation","Unified modeling language","Computational complexity","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO radar","radar signal processing","search problems","sequential estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler estimation algorithm","multiple-input multiple-output radar","high-dimensional searching procedures","computational efficient algorithm","MIMO radar joint DOA","unstructured maximum likelihood method","one-dimensional searching procedures","conventional maximum likelihood algorithms","joint direction-of-arrival estimation","direction-of-departure estimation","DOD estimation","extended invariance principle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival","direction-of-departure","Doppler","unstructured maximum likelihood estimation","multiple-input multiple-output radar","extended invariance principle"]}],"abstract":"Joint direction-of-arrival (DOA), direction-of-departure (DOD), and Doppler estimation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar usually are too time-consuming to implement because of high-dimensional searching procedures.

The World Health Organization underlines the importance of reporting ADRs for patients' safety. The fact is that ADRs tend to be under-reported in daily hospital praxis. In this context, automatic solutions based on text mining can help to alleviate the workload of experts. Nevertheless, these solutions pose two challenges: 1) EHRs show high lexical variability, the characterization of the events must be able to deal with unseen words or contexts and 2) ADRs are rare events, hence, the system should be robust against skewed class distribution. To tackle these challenges, deep neural networks seem appropriate because they allow a high-level representation. Specifically, we opted for a joint AB-LSTM network, a sub-class of the bidirectional long short-term memory network. Besides, in an attempt to reinforce lexical variability, we proposed the use of embeddings created using lemmas. We compared this approach with supervised event extraction approaches based on either symbolic or dense representations. Experimental results showed that the joint AB-LSTM approach outperformed previous approaches, achieving an f-measure of 73.3.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2018.2879744","startPage":"2148","endPage":"2155","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health

Numerical results obtained with our proposed approach demonstrate its effectiveness over previously proposed techniques.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2879317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2879317","startPage":"4","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8605392/08523681.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Task Scheduling With Stochastic Delay Cost in Mobile Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Task Scheduling With Stochastic Delay Cost in Mobile Edge Computing","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18360962","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8523681/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772064"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2017YJS026"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Task Scheduling With Stochastic Delay Cost in Mobile Edge Computing","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-2879317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095887S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8605392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8605392","articleId":"8523681","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8523683,"authors":[{"name":"Saber Mahboubi","affiliation":["School of Computing, Science and Engineering, University of Salford, Salford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8523683/mahbo-2879633-small.gif","p":["Saber Mahboubi received the bachelor\u2019s degree in power engineering from the University of Rajaee, Tehran, Iran, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree in mechatronics from the University of Tabriz, Iran, in 2010.

When interacting with an object, the dynamic properties of the object will play an important role where a gripper (as a system), which has been shown to be stable as per appropriate stability criteria, can become unstable when coupled to an object. However, including a sufficiently compliant element within the actuation system of the robotic hand can increase the stability of the grasp in the presence of uncertainties. This paper deals with an innovative robotic variable stiffness hand design, VSH\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n, for industrial applications. The main objective of this paper is to realize an affordable, as well as durable, adaptable, and compliant gripper for industrial environments with a larger interval of stiffness variability than similar existing systems. The driving system for the proposed hand consists of two servo motors and one linear spring arranged in a relatively simple fashion. Having just a single spring in the actuation system helps us to achieve a very small hysteresis band and represents a means by which to rapidly control the stiffness. We prove, both mathematically and experimentally, that the proposed model is characterized by a broad range of stiffness. To control the grasp, a first-order sliding mode controller is designed and presented. The experimental results provided will show how, despite the relatively simple implementation of our first prototype, the hand performs extremely well in terms of both stiffness variability and force controllability.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879633","startPage":"68195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08523683.pdf","endPage":"68209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523683/","displayDocTitle":"Variable Stiffness Robotic Hand for Stable Grasp and Flexible Handling","volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8523683/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011102","fundingName":"Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"608022"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Variable Stiffness Robotic Hand for Stable Grasp and Flexible Handling","sourcePdf":"access-mahboubi-2879633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139115S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8523683","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8523801,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8523801/zhang-2879611-small.gif","p":["Yu Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Shandong University, China, in 2016.

However, due to the incomplete implementation of system resource isolation mechanisms in the Linux kernel, some security concerns still exist for multiple containers sharing an operating system kernel on a multi-tenancy container-based cloud service. In this paper, we first present the information leakage channels we discovered that are accessible within containers. Such channels expose a spectrum of system-wide host information to containers without proper resource partitioning. By exploiting such leaked host information, it becomes much easier for malicious adversaries (acting as tenants in a container cloud) to launch attacks that might impact the reliability of cloud services. We demonstrate that the information leakage channels could be exploited to infer private data, detect and verify co-residence, build covert channels, and launch more advanced cloud-based attacks. We discuss the root causes of the containers' information leakage and propose a two-stage defense approach. As demonstrated in the evaluation, our defense is effective and incurs trivial performance overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2018.2879605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2018.2879605","startPage":"174","endPage":"191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858/9316344/08523802.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9316344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on the Security Implications of Information Leakages in Container Clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Study on the Security Implications of Information Leakages in Container Clouds","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2021","accessionNumber":"20286367","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/8523802/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on the Security Implications of Information Leakages in Container Clouds","sourcePdf":"tdsc-gao-2879605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140791S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"9316344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9316344","articleId":"8523802","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8523808,"authors":[{"name":"Yinglin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinglin","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0001-8088-0404","id":"37086486337"},{"name":"Peng Ouyang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ouyang","orcid":"0000-0001-6598-3472","id":"38057184600"},{"name":"Wang Kang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Kang","orcid":"0000-0002-3169-6034","id":"38238916200"},{"name":"Shouyi Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shouyi","lastName":"Yin","orcid":"0000-0003-2309-572X","id":"37400289900"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086214193"},{"name":"Shaojun Wei","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaojun","lastName":"Wei","orcid":"0000-0001-5117-7920","id":"37404117300"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0003-1731-9459","id":"37536930400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"8523808","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":763},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Adders","Computer architecture","Random access memory","Switches","Acceleration","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integral histogram","parallel architecture","STT-MRAM","processing in memory","full adder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8523808","abstract":"The integral histogram image plays an important role in accelerating the feature computation in vision algorithms. However, the computational process of the integral histogram, called integral computation, has high computational complexity and numerous memory access operations, which limit its wide application. This brief proposes an in-memory computational architecture based on Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) to solve these problems. The architecture can work in two different modes depending on the requirements: the integral computation mode and the memory mode. The architecture can figure out the integral histogram when in the integral computation mode, and just store the data directly when in the memory mode. Utilizing the non-volatile, high density and low power characteristics of STT-MRAM, we integrate the computational units into the memory array to achieve parallel computation.

By utilizing such a simulator, software design can proceed in parallel with hardware development which results in the reduction of the so important time-to-market. The main problem, however, is that currently there is a shortage of such simulation frameworks; most simulators used for modelling the user applications (i.e., full-system CPU/Mem/Peripheral simulators) lack any type of support for tailor-made hardware accelerators. The presented ACSIM framework is the first known open-source, high-performance simulator that can handle holistically system-of-systems including processors, peripherals, accelerators, and networks; such an approach is, for example, very appealing for the design of Cloud Servers that incorporate FPGAs as PCI-connected accelerators. ACSIM is an extension of the COSSIM simulation framework and it integrates, in a novel and efficient way, a combined system and network simulator with a SystemC simulator, in a transparent to the end-user way. ACSIM has been evaluated when executing several real-world use cases; the end results demonstrate that the presented approach has up to 99 percent accuracy in the reported SuD aspects (when compared with the corresponding characteristics measured in the real systems), while the overall simulation time can be accelerated almost linearly with the number of CPUs utilized by the simulator. More importantly, the presented interconnection scheme between the Processing and the SystemC simulators is orders of magnitude faster than the existing solutions, while ACSIM can efficiently simulate up to several hundreds of processing nodes with hardware accelerators interconnected together, in a fully distributed manner.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/8630102/08523815.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel, Simulator for Heterogeneous Cloud Systems that Incorporate Custom Hardware Accelerators","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2018.2879601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8630102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2018.2879601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8523815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel, Simulator for Heterogeneous Cloud Systems that Incorporate Custom Hardware Accelerators","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2019","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8523815/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"H2020 ECOSCALE project","grantNumber":"#671632"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel, Simulator for Heterogeneous Cloud Systems that Incorporate Custom Hardware Accelerators","sourcePdf":"tmscs-tampouratzis-2879601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053883S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"8630102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","xplore-issue":"8630102","articleId":"8523815","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8523816,"authors":[{"name":"Chongwen Huang","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8541135/8523816/huang-2879620-small.gif","p":["Chongwen Huang (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in 2010 from Nankai University, Binhai College, Binhai, China, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2013.

The channel coefficients of the mmWave MIMO are approximately modeled as a Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution and the channel matrix is sparse with only a few nonzero entries. By leveraging the advantage of sparseness, we propose an algorithm that iteratively detects the exact locations and values of nonzero entries of the sparse channel matrix. At each iteration, the locations are detected by the SMP, and values are estimated with the LSE. We also analyze the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound (CLRB), and show that the proposed algorithm is a minimum variance unbiased estimator under the assumption that we have the partial priori knowledge of the channel. Furthermore, we employ the Gaussian approximation for message densities under density evolution to simplify the analysis of the algorithm, which provides a simple method to predict the performance of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm has much better performance than the existing sparse estimators, especially when the channel is sparse. In addition, our proposed algorithm converges to the CRLB of the genie-aided estimation of sparse channels with only five turbo iterations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2879620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2879620","startPage":"245","endPage":"259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8541135/08523816.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8541135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Channel Estimation Using LSE and Sparse Message Passing for MmWave MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Channel Estimation Using LSE and Sparse Message Passing for MmWave MIMO Systems","volume":"67","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18281648","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8523816/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MIT-SUTD International Design Center"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC 61750110529"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012453","fundingName":"Providence Health Care","grantNumber":"913888J"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Channel Estimation Using LSE and Sparse Message Passing for MmWave MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2879620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.281401S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8541135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8541135","articleId":"8523816","onlineDate":"05 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8523827,"authors":[{"name":"Allemki Santhosh Kumar","affiliation":["OPJS University, Churu, Rajasthan"],"firstName":"Allemki Santhosh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086508331"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6621-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6619-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6622-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-943X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2471-7851"}],"articleNumber":"8523827","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8523827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Antenna radiation patterns","Particle swarm optimization","Microstrip antennas","Neural networks","Microstrip","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","genetic algorithms","microstrip antennas","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Neural Networks","Genetic Algorithm","radiation pattern","simulation time","Particle Swarm Optimization","Rectangular Patch MicroStrip Antenna","Genetic algorithms","Rectangular MicroStrip Antenna design","PSO algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radiation Pattern","PSO","Ga","nn"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2017.8523827","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501353/8523822/08523827.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8523822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2017.8523827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rectangular Micro Strip Antenna Design Using Particle Swarm Optimiztion,Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms","abstract":"This paper deals with the designing of a Rectangular Patch Micro Strip Antenna using a different algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Neural Networks(NN), Genetic Algorithm(GA).

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a common form of attack that targets cloud computing. Also, new features of cloud computing such as virtualization and virtual machine migration introduces additional challenges to cloud security as studies reports that the detection accuracy of anomaly detection system is degraded during the migration of virtual machine from one host to another. Therefore, providing effective security is paramount to the quality of service in cloud computing. DDoS attack is carried out by compromising vulnerable host which are used to carry out coordinated attack against a target. This paper therefore proposed a model for an adaptive and distributed IDS for cloud computing capable of effectively detecting coordinated attacks and also addressing challenges introduced by migration of virtual machines in cloud IDS.","doi":"10.1109/ICT-ISPC.2018.8523905","publicationTitle":"2018 Seventh ICT International Student Project Conference (ICT-ISPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Seventh ICT International Student Project Conference (ICT-ISPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509798/8523855/08523905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICT-ISPC.2018.8523905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8523855","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model for Adaptive and Distributed Intrusion Detection for Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8523905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Model for Adaptive and Distributed Intrusion Detection for Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8523905/","conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18232707","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8523905/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model for Adaptive and Distributed Intrusion Detection for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Nakhonpathom, Thailand","sourcePdf":"ISPC2018CameraReady23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099509S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509798","isNumber":"8523855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509798","xplore-issue":"8523855","articleId":"8523905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8523942,"authors":[{"name":"Nuttapong Klaokliang","affiliation":["Applied Network Technology, Khon Kaen University 123 Mitaparb Rd., Maung, Khon Kaen, Thailand"],"firstName":"Nuttapong","lastName":"Klaokliang","id":"37086511594"},{"name":"Padungpol Teawtim","affiliation":["Applied Network Technology, Khon Kaen University 123 Mitaparb Rd., Maung, Khon Kaen, Thailand"],"firstName":"Padungpol","lastName":"Teawtim","id":"37086509297"},{"name":"Phet Aimtongkham","affiliation":["Applied Network Technology, Khon Kaen University 123 Mitaparb Rd., Maung, Khon Kaen, Thailand"],"firstName":"Phet","lastName":"Aimtongkham","id":"37086198732"},{"name":"Chakchai So-In","affiliation":["Applied Network Technology, Khon Kaen University 123 Mitaparb Rd., Maung, Khon Kaen, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chakchai","lastName":"So-In","id":"38274911800"},{"name":"Aimaschana Niruntasukrat","affiliation":["NECTEC, National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) 112 Thailand Science Park, Thanon Phahonyothin Tambon Klong Nueng, Amphoe Klong Luang, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Aimaschana","lastName":"Niruntasukrat","id":"37085645484"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7805-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7804-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-7803-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7806-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8523942","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":684},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authorization","Computer architecture","Fabrics","Genetic algorithms","Peer-to-peer computing","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","genetic algorithms","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input transactions","transaction transfer success rate","distributed authorization architecture","Internet of Things","hyperledger fabric framework","genetic algorithm","IoT authorization architecture","GA Kafka","optimization","optimal consensus component"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Thing","Authorization architecture","Hyperledger Fabric","Consensus optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8523942","abstract":"This paper proposes a distributed authorization architecture for Internet of Things adopting a hyperledger fabric framework.

MCC has a qualitative, flexible and cost effective delivery platform for providing services to mobile cloud users with the aid of internet. Due to advent of MCC, capabilities of mobile devices have been improved. Now, mobile devices are dependent on cloud based computing and information storage resources, to carryout complex computational operations, which includes multimedia, searching and data mining. While addressing the limitations of mobile devices through MCC, various issues related to the efficient operation of MCC including security, quality of services and application development for mobile devices and offloading have been originated. Recently, the issues of MCC have witnessed significant attentions from industries and academia due to the huge potential to reduce computing cost and to ease the availability of computing power in mobile devices. Various proposals have been made to address theissues of MCC. The previous architectures have not define the user phase and the different communication technology protocols. In this context, this paper qualitatively reviews MCC focusing on layered architecture. Specifically, a five-layered architecture for MCCis proposed including task application, perception, network infrastructure, Internet and communication and computation layer.

Unfortunately, not all existing networks design are friendly to quantization. For example, the popular lightweight MobileNetV1, while it successfully reduces parameter size and computation latency with separable convolution, our experiment shows its quantized models have large performance gap against its float point models. To resolve this, we analyzed the root cause of quantization loss and proposed a quantization-friendly separable convolution architecture. By evaluating the image classification task on ImageNet2012 dataset, our modified MobileNetV1 model can archive 8-bit inference top-1 accuracy in 68.03%, almost closed the gap to the float pipeline.","doi":"10.1109/EMC2.2018.00011","publicationTitle":"2018 1st Workshop on Energy Efficient Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing for Embedded Applications (EMC2)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 1st Workshop on Energy Efficient Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing for Embedded Applications (EMC2)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8521657/8524006/08524017.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMC2.2018.00011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Quantization-Friendly Separable Convolution for MobileNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 March 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524017/","displayDocTitle":"A Quantization-Friendly Separable Convolution for MobileNets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Mar 2018","accessionNumber":"18232807","htmlLink":"/document/8524017/","conferenceDate":"25-25 March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quantization-Friendly Separable Convolution for MobileNets","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"736701a014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082153S","chronDate":"25-25 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8521657","isNumber":"8524006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8521657","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8524006","articleId":"8524017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524018,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Hamed Fatemi Langroudi","affiliation":["Neuromorphic AI Lab, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York"],"firstName":"Seyed Hamed","lastName":"Fatemi Langroudi","id":"37085364907"},{"name":"Tej Pandit","affiliation":["Neuromorphic AI Lab, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York"],"firstName":"Tej","lastName":"Pandit","id":"37086517571"},{"name":"Dhireesha Kudithipudi","affiliation":["Neuromorphic AI Lab, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York"],"firstName":"Dhireesha","lastName":"Kudithipudi","id":"37282444800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7367-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7368-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8524018","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":825},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic range","Computer architecture","Performance evaluation","Training","Neural networks","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","embedded systems","feedforward neural nets","fixed point arithmetic","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning inference","embedded devices","inference step","resource constrained environments","hardware levels","posit number system","software levels","deep convolutional neural networks","fixed-point number systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Convolutional neural network","Low precision representation","Posit number system"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Inference on Embedded Devices: Fixed-Point vs Posit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524018","doi":"10.1109/EMC2.2018.00012","startPage":"19","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2018 1st Workshop on Energy Efficient Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing for Embedded Applications (EMC2)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 1st Workshop on Energy Efficient Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing for Embedded Applications (EMC2)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8521657/8524006/08524018.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMC2.2018.00012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524006","abstract":"Performing the inference step of deep learning in resource constrained environments, such as embedded devices, is challenging. Success requires optimization at both software and hardware levels. Low precision arithmetic and specifically low precision fixed-point number systems have become the standard for performing deep learning inference. However, representing non-uniform data and distributed parameters (e.g. weights) by using uniformly distributed fixed-point values is still a major drawback when using this number system. Recently, the posit number system was proposed, which represents numbers in a non-uniform manner. Therefore, in this paper we are motivated to explore using the posit number system to represent the weights of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. However, we do not apply any quantization techniques and hence the network weights do not require re-training. The results of this exploration show that using the posit number system outperformed the fixed point number system in terms of accuracy and memory utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 March 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524018/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8524018/","publicationDate":"Mar 2018","accessionNumber":"18232815","conferenceDate":"25-25 March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Inference on Embedded Devices: Fixed-Point vs Posit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Inference on Embedded Devices: Fixed-Point vs Posit","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"736701a019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067641S","chronDate":"25-25 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8521657","isNumber":"8524006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8521657","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8524006","articleId":"8524018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":8524021,"authors":[{"name":"Sumanth Gudaparthi","affiliation":["University of Utah"],"firstName":"Sumanth","lastName":"Gudaparthi","id":"37086519052"},{"name":"Surya Narayanan","affiliation":["University of Utah"],"firstName":"Surya","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"37086007006"},{"name":"Rajeev Balasubramonian","affiliation":["University of Utah"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Balasubramonian","id":"37086115760"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7367-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7368-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8524021","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Random access memory","Computer architecture","Kernel","Rats","Throughput","Analog circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","convolution","feedforward neural nets","integrated circuit design","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN accelerator computations closer","operands","compute units","in-situ dot-product computations","data movement","dot-products","in-situ operation","analog circuits","subarray rows","data transfers","storage units","CPUs last level cache","bit-wise AND","H-Tree interconnects","DaDianNao baseline"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","neuromorphic architectures","neural networks","accelerator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524021","abstract":"A significant fraction of energy in recent CNN accelerators is dissipated in moving operands between storage and compute units. In this work, we re-purpose the CPU's last level cache to perform in-situ dot-product computations, thus significantly reducing data movement. Since a last level cache has several subarrays, many such dot-products can be performed in parallel, thus boosting throughput as well. The in-situ operation does not require analog circuits; it is performed with a bit-wise AND of two subarray rows, followed by digital aggregation of partial sums. The proposed architecture yields a 2.74\u00d7 improvement in throughput and a 6.31\u00d7 improvement in energy, relative to a DaDianNao baseline. This is primarily because the proposed architecture eliminates a large fraction of data transfers over H-Tree interconnects in the cache.","doi":"10.1109/EMC2.2018.00015","publicationTitle":"2018 1st Workshop on Energy Efficient Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing for Embedded Applications (EMC2)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 1st Workshop on Energy Efficient Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing for Embedded Applications (EMC2)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8521657/8524006/08524021.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMC2.2018.00015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving CNN Accelerator Computations Closer to Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"Moving CNN Accelerator Computations Closer to Data","htmlLink":"/document/8524021/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Mar 2018","accessionNumber":"18232813","conferenceDate":"25-25 March 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving CNN Accelerator Computations Closer to Data","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"736701a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057622S","chronDate":"25-25 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8521657","isNumber":"8524006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8521657","xplore-issue":"8524006","articleId":"8524021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8524034,"authors":[{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Huei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092300"},{"name":"Jung-Lin Lin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Jung-Lin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086111546"},{"name":"Zuo-Min Tsai","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Cheng University, Chai-Yi, Taiwan, ROC"],"firstName":"Zuo-Min","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37301805900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5971-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5970-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5972-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8524034","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":966},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Linearity","Circuit faults","CMOS technology","Millimeter wave technology","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital communication","linearisation techniques","millimetre wave power amplifiers","power combiners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave CMOS power amplifiers","basic power amplifier architectures","power gain","power added efficiency","mobile digital communication devices","power combining techniques","linearization techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifiers","CMOS","Millimeter-wave","Linearization Techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524034","abstract":"This paper reviews the current status of millimeter-wave CMOS power amplifiers.

The proposed scheme employs two types of LDOs that generate isolated supply voltages and a buffer to sense a common-mode signal. Thanks to the isolated supply rails, both the intrinsic common-mode rejection ratio (ICMRR) and common-mode input impedance of the low-noise amplifier (LNA) are increased, which leads to the total common-mode rejection ratio (TCMRR) above 89.2 dB up to 1 kHz even in 16-channel recording with a shared reference electrode. Compared to the conventional method, the TCMRR is improved by 48.7 dB even for 28% mismatch of the electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) and 1% mismatch of the LNA input capacitances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8524035/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"August 2018","accessionNumber":"18262643","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"16-Channel High-CMRR Neural-Recording Amplifiers Using Common-Made-Tracking Power Supply Rails","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"16-Channel High-CMRR Neural-Recording Amplifiers Using Common-Made-Tracking Power Supply Rails","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"p4-jang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047931S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501633","isNumber":"8524024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501633","xplore-issue":"8524024","articleId":"8524035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8524047,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Herdt","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Herdt","id":"37071425200"},{"name":"Daniel Gro\u00dfe","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Gro\u00dfe","id":"37293737900"},{"name":"Hoang M.

At the heart of an IoT device, the processor is the core component. Hence, as an open and free instruction set architecture RISC-V is gaining huge popularity for IoT. A large ecosystem is available around RISC-V, including various RTL implementations at one end and high-speed instruction set simulators (ISSs) at the other end. These ISSs facilitate functional verification of RTL implementations as well as early SW development to some extent. However, being designed predominantly for speed, they can hardly be extended to support further system-level use cases such as design space exploration, power/timing/performance validation or analysis of complex HW/SW interactions. In this paper, we propose and implement the first RISC-V based Virtual Prototype (VP) with the goal of filling this gap. We provide a RISC-V RV321M core, a PLIC-based interrupt controller and an essential set of peripherals together with SW debug capabilities. The VP is designed as extensible and configurable platform with a generic bus system and implemented in standard-compliant SystemC and TLM-2.0. The latter point is very important, since it allows to leverage cutting-edge SystemC-based modeling techniques needed for the mentioned use cases. Our VP allows a significantly faster simulation compared to RTL, while being more accurate than existing ISSs. Finally, our RISC-V VP is fully open source to help expanding the RISC-V ecosystem and stimulating further research and development.","doi":"10.1109/FDL.2018.8524047","publicationTitle":"2018 Forum on Specification & Design Languages (FDL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Forum on Specification & Design Languages (FDL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501260/8524032/08524047.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDL.2018.8524047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extensible and Configurable RISC-V Based Virtual Prototype","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524047/","displayDocTitle":"Extensible and Configurable RISC-V Based Virtual Prototype","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18248414","htmlLink":"/document/8524047/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extensible and Configurable RISC-V Based Virtual Prototype","confLoc":"Garching, Germany","sourcePdf":"6-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07763S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501260","isNumber":"8524032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501260","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8524032","articleId":"8524047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524070,"authors":[{"name":"Nagahiro Yoshino","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Nagahiro","lastName":"Yoshino","id":"37086192807"},{"name":"Keita Norishima","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Keita","lastName":"Norishima","id":"37085753257"},{"name":"Mizuki Motoyoshi","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Mizuki","lastName":"Motoyoshi","id":"37285265900"},{"name":"Suguru Kameda","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Suguru","lastName":"Kameda","id":"37300149000"},{"name":"Noriharu Suematsu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriharu","lastName":"Suematsu","id":"37298359500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5971-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5970-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5972-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8524070","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Signal to noise ratio","Radio frequency","Switching circuits","Semiconductor device measurement","Clocks","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["28 GHz-band direct RF undersampling S/H","40 dB SNR","direct RF undersampling reception","power consumption","series/shunt switching type sample","hold integrated circuit","90 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor process","Ka-band","aperture terminal application","IC performed signal-to-noise ratio","higher frequency operation","multilevel modulated signal","SNR improvement","S/H IC","higher SNR","higher RF frequency","65 nm CMOS process","hold capacitor","frequency 19.4 GHz to 20.2 GHz","size 90.0 nm","noise figure 27.3 dB","size 65.0 nm","noise figure 41.2 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital RF","RFIC","Receiver","CMOS","Sampling mixer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524070","abstract":"We have studied direct RF undersampling reception to reduce the size and power consumption.

In this paper, a 28 GHz-band S/H IC with higher SNR has been developed. In order to improve SNR at higher RF frequency, 65 nm CMOS process is introduced to enhance the switching speed of sampling, the size of hold capacitor is optimized and the two-stage output buffer amplifier is employed.

These systems are often only activated on request and their power consumption is therefore dominated by the idle-mode. Power reduction mechanisms such as clock or power gating reduce the activity or leakage in the purely digital circuits. We propose a novel adaptive clocking scheme that optimizes the energy demand using a fine-grained oscillator control on cycle-level. To evaluate our new approach, we analytically analyze the power consumption of the regarded system in comparison with available methods. The power of our new adaptive clocking is shown in an integrated smart sensor for capacitive measurements working in a passive wireless sensor node. Using our methods, we show that the energy demand of the example system is reduced even in the case of continuous measurements that demand for a high activity in the digital circuitry.","doi":"10.1109/FDL.2018.8524131","publicationTitle":"2018 Forum on Specification & Design Languages (FDL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Forum on Specification & Design Languages (FDL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501260/8524032/08524131.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDL.2018.8524131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524131/","displayDocTitle":"From Low-Power to No-Power: Adaptive Clocking for Event-Driven Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18248412","htmlLink":"/document/8524131/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Low-Power to No-Power: Adaptive Clocking for Event-Driven Systems","confLoc":"Garching, Germany","sourcePdf":"4-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059358S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501260","isNumber":"8524032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501260","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8524032","articleId":"8524131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8524160,"authors":[{"name":"Ramya Jothikumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College, Puducherry, India"],"firstName":"Ramya","lastName":"Jothikumar","id":"37062129400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3521-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-3520-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3522-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8524160","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"The complexity of Breadth First Signal Decoder (BSIDE) is an efficient algorithm to obtain optimum Maximum Likelihood (ML) performance with lower complexity.

The recent introduction of Disguised Face Identification (DFI) framework [1] proves the applicability of deep neural networks for this very problem. All the ATMs nowadays incorporate a hidden camera in them and capture the footage of their users. However, it is impossible for the police to track down the impersonators with disguised faces from the ATM footage. The proposed DCNN model is trained to identify, in real time, whether the user in the captured image is trying to cloak his identity or not. The output of the DCNN is then reported to the ATM to take appropriate steps and prevent the swindler from completing the transaction. The network is trained using a dataset of images captured in similar situations as of an ATM. The comparatively low background clutter and less viewpoint variation in the images enable the network to demonstrate high accuracy in feature extraction and classification for all the different disguises.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2017.8524167","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501353/8523822/08524167.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2017.8524167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8523822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Deep Convolutional Neural Network to Prevent ATM Fraud by Facial Disguise Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Training","Online banking","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Law enforcement","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","fraud","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional neural network architecture","disguised face identification framework","fraudulent automated teller machine transaction","captured image","DCNN model","ATM footage","deep neural networks","facial disguise Identification","prevent ATM fraud"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Disguised Face Identification","Deep Learning","TensorFlow","Pattern Classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Application of Deep Convolutional Neural Network to Prevent ATM Fraud by Facial Disguise Identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8524167/","publicationDate":"December 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"18220419","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Deep Convolutional Neural Network to Prevent ATM Fraud by Facial Disguise Identification","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1700174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071324S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8501353","isNumber":"8523822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501353","xplore-issue":"8523822","articleId":"8524167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524181,"authors":[{"name":"Anjana Das K.M.","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Anjana","lastName":"Das K.M.","id":"37087121877"},{"name":"O.V.

In Indian traffic scenarios we will find this anomalous behavior of vehicles in a larger scale. In this paper we consider three specific kinds of anomalies that occur on the road, viz. vehicles crossing road, pedestrian crossing roads, and change in motion patterns of vehicles on road. Proposed method can assist the driver as a part of ADAS. Traditional camera based methods detect abnormal motion using orientation only of the optical flow. Our method fuses both magnitude and orientation information. Performance obtained on benchmark ITS dataset is presented and analyzed.

The basic entities involve primary user (PU), secondary user (SU), and vacant spectrum. PU holds the license of the spectrum whereas SU exploits the unused spectrum in order to construct a network. The CRN solves the inefficiency in spectrum usage in opportunistic manner. Any two SU nodes are called neighbor if they reside within their communication range and spectrum is not in used by PU. It is noticed that the PU nodes select its spectrum, arbitrarily. Therefore, to hold a path from any source to destination is always a challenge in CRN. In this work, we propose a distributed algorithm to design a minimum spanning tree algorithm using bio-inspired method in CRN. The minimum spanning tree is useful in various applications such as, optimization, data dissemination, synchronization, routing etc. for various distributed systems. The correctness proof is included for algorithm verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18248520","htmlLink":"/document/8524227/","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Approach to Construct Minimum Spanning Tree in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-Inspired Approach to Construct Minimum Spanning Tree in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070224S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501332","isNumber":"8523828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501332","xplore-issue":"8523828","articleId":"8524227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524228,"authors":[{"name":"Preksha Jain","affiliation":["Deptt. of Electronics & Electrical Engg., Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Preksha","lastName":"Jain","id":"37086508738"},{"name":"Gurjot Singh Gaba","affiliation":["Deptt. of Electronics & Electrical Engg., Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Gurjot Singh","lastName":"Gaba","id":"38241343700"},{"name":"Lavish Kansal","affiliation":["Deptt. of Electronics & Electrical Engg., Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Lavish","lastName":"Kansal","id":"37085579919"},{"name":"Sarah Ngo","affiliation":["Deptt. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, St. Cloud State University, U.S."],"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Ngo","id":"37086508691"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3521-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-3520-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3522-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8524228","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Antenna arrays","MIMO communication","NOMA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","quality of experience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","fifth generation mobile networks","quality of experience","QoE","5G mobile networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","IoT","macro cell","massive MIMO","millimeter wave","RAT"]}],"abstract":"Fifth generation (5G) mobile networks have revolutionized the scenario of communication but are not yet realized globally.

Many approaches focus on the tracking algorithm to smoothen the video sequence in order to overcome the issues of tracking, related to object movement and appearance. These methods uses object shape, colour, texture, object of interest and motion in multi direction in tracking for video surveillance applications. This paper elaborate the exhaustive survey of various object tracking algorithms under different environmental conditions and identified efficient algorithm in various types of tracking. In this paper objects are tracked based on colour, motion of single and multiple objects (vehicles) are detected and counted in multiple frames.

For this, there are many modes of secure transmission of message. The Subcarrier Shifting Chaotic Cognitive Radio system (SSCCR) in OFDM is one among the modes. Chaotic Cognitive Radio (CCR) will sense the unused channels from the surrounding and that unused channels used for the transmission of message. For effective security purpose, chaotic sequence has to apply for Cognitive Radio (CR). Since chaotic maps publicly known, eavesdroppers can effortlessly solve the main parameters of chaotic sequence and restore the information. Hence, I present a new idea that is Subcarrier Shifting in OFDM for the better security mechanism of CCR system. CCR system will sense the unused subcarriers from the surroundings and these subcarriers used for the transmission of information by combining with chaotic sequence. Thus at end CCR system with Subcarrier Shifting is proposed. With the mathematical model, Bit Error Rate (BER) formula derived. Thus at simulation side I analyze the Power Spectrum after the chaotic encoding and decoding. I also calculated the Capacity and Spectral Efficiency of SSCCR system. Finally, Bit Error Rate (BER) calculations done for the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper receiver and they compared with each other.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2018.8524299","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501332/8523828/08524299.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2018.8524299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8523828","startPage":"0504","endPage":"0507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of Capacity, Spectral Efficiency, Bit Error Rate in Chaotic Cognitive Radio System with Subcarrier Shifting in OFDM-MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of Capacity, Spectral Efficiency, Bit Error Rate in Chaotic Cognitive Radio System with Subcarrier Shifting in OFDM-MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524299/","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18248516","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8524299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of Capacity, Spectral Efficiency, Bit Error Rate in Chaotic Cognitive Radio System with Subcarrier Shifting in OFDM-MIMO","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038149S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501332","isNumber":"8523828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501332","xplore-issue":"8523828","articleId":"8524299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524301,"authors":[{"name":"Priyadarshini Patil","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, KLE Technological University, Hubli, India"],"firstName":"Priyadarshini","lastName":"Patil","id":"37085491356"},{"name":"Nagaratna Yaligar","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, KLE Technological University, Hubli, India"],"firstName":"Nagaratna","lastName":"Yaligar","id":"37085646537"},{"name":"S.M.

This requires the transistor to operate at low supply voltages.

Besides, the second order effects will be more predominant with scaling. In addition, the intrinsic gain available from the transistors is lessening. This trend makes the traditional techniques, like cascoding and gain boosting, unproductive for achieving high DC gain in nano-scale CMOS processes. Consequently, horizontal cascading (multi-stage) must be used in order to realize high-gain op-amps in low-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\nprocesses. One major hardship in doing so is the trade-off between gain and stability. With multi-staging, gain increases at the cost of stability of the system. In order to achieve better stability, there is a need for op-amp compensation.

Multicarrier complementary phase-coded signal has been a field of interest for many researchers due to its prominent properties. This paper aims to reduce the Peak-to-Mean Envelope Power Ratio (PMEPR) of a Multicarrier Complementary Phase-Coded (MCPC) signal consisting of P subcarriers which are phase modulated by P phase sequences. The carriers are equally separated in terms of frequency. The carrier separation is equal to the reciprocal of t\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n, which is equal to the span of each phase element, forming Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).

Signal power has been increased using optical amplifier in FSO by WDM and then analyzed at 2.5 Gbps to get the desired signal. The WDM based FSO system for worst weather condition using hybrid configuration of optical amplifier (EDFA, SOA) is proposed which provide a solution for more efficient system and low cost.

A linearized mathematical model of TRMS which takes into account process noises (disturbances) and measurement noises in the system is considered. A Kalman Filter is designed for this system to obtain the noise free outputs from the noisy outputs of the system. It is controlled in two degrees of freedom using a cross PID (CPID) controller and also a conventional PID controller for comparison purpose. Both these controllers are tuned using three different metaheuristic optimization algorithms - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Dynamic Spread Factor PSO (SFPSO) which is an improved version of the PSO and NMSPSO which is a hybrid algorithm of PSO with Nelder Mead Simplex (NMS) search method. Numerical simulations are performed to obtain the transient and steady state performance of the system for both the controllers.

In this regard, six-phase transmission system with the ability to transmit 73% more power has been proved to be a better alternative than the classical three phase transmission network and that too without any major modifications in the existing set-up. However, the protection protocol of six-phase transmission system is quite complex, due to the larger number of possible faults. In this context, this paper presents a protection scheme based on combined framework of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and support vector machine (SVM). The approach aims at performing the tasks of detection and classification of shunt faults in six-phase transmission system. The use SVM is motivated by the fact that it has emerged as an efficient, powerful and fast machine learning tool for finding solution to the complex classification problems. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme have been examined for wide variation in fault parameters such as fault location, fault resistance and inception angle. The test results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in providing information regarding the system status and immunity to parameter perturbations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2017.8524340","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501353/8523822/08524340.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2017.8524340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8523822","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protection Scheme for Shunt Faults in Six-Phase Transmission System Based on Wavelet Transform and Support Vector Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Protection Scheme for Shunt Faults in Six-Phase Transmission System Based on Wavelet Transform and Support Vector Machine","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524340/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"December 2017","accessionNumber":"18220413","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8524340/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protection Scheme for Shunt Faults in Six-Phase Transmission System Based on Wavelet Transform and Support Vector Machine","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1700402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072724S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8501353","isNumber":"8523822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501353","xplore-issue":"8523822","articleId":"8524340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524371,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A fair comparison of area overhead, power and delay of MC has been made with Decimal Matrix code (DMC), Reed Muller code (RMC) and Hamming code (HC). MC has been implemented with encoder reuse architecture. Fault detection technique for encoder and decoder are also incorporated apart from memory protection using hardware redundancy. Correction coverage of MC, DMC, RMC and HC has been determined by injecting errors in random positions. The results show that Matrix code corrects errors with less area overhead compared to Decimal Matrix code, Reed Muller code and Hamming code.","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501332/8523828/08524371.pdf","startPage":"0254","endPage":"0257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2018.8524371","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2018.8524371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8523828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of an Area Efficient Matrix Code with Encoder Reuse Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of an Area Efficient Matrix Code with Encoder Reuse Method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524371/","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8524371/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18220329","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of an Area Efficient Matrix Code with Encoder Reuse Method","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04709S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501332","isNumber":"8523828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8523828","articleId":"8524371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524378,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It plays a main role in the clinical and surgical environment to diagnose many diseases such as tumors, dementias, bone injuries, spinal injuries, stroke etc. Alzheimer is the one type of dementia for older adults which gives brain disorder. It is a common neurodegenerative dementia. MR Images provide benefits for identifying Alzheimer. In MR images, brain asymmetry identification is a hectic process because the normal human brain is not symmetrical nature. Proposed method defines asymmetry analysis of brain hemispheres with the help of genetic algorithm. In this work, whole brain analysis is carried out for brain MR Alzheimer images. Proposed system uses Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering technique is used to segment gray matter and white matter. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is extracted from the segmented white and gray matter tissues. The same pipeline is adopted for asymmetry of the brain hemispheres. The results show that, asymmetry analysis of brain hemispheres is found to be very effective for differentiation of normal and abnormal tissues compared to whole brain analysis. This work proved is that, it has a difference between white and gray matter in which the gray matter gives better result than white matter. The quantification of this brain hemispheric change leads to improved diagnosis and better assessment of the neuroprotectic effect of a therapy. Hence this study is prominent for diagnosing Alzheimer disease.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2018.8524378","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501332/8523828/08524378.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"905","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2018.8524378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8523828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain Hemisphere Analysis Using Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Clustering in Alzheimer Disease","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Brain Hemisphere Analysis Using Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Clustering in Alzheimer Disease","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18262601","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8524378/","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain Hemisphere Analysis Using Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Clustering in Alzheimer Disease","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045168S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501332","isNumber":"8523828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8523828","articleId":"8524378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524387,"authors":[{"name":"R Yogitha","affiliation":["Department of computer science and engineering, Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Yogitha","id":"37086508384"},{"name":"G.

This paper proposes a strategy for fusion of different types of MRI brain images like T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w) and FLAIR images. MRI is most widely and commonly used scanning technique especially for detecting all kinds of brain tumor and stroke. Here a gradient based discrete wavelet transform is proposed for fusing the different types of MRI images of same patients for better diagnosis of brain pathology. The first step includes the DWT decomposition for getting the fused image 1. The second step involves gradient measure to the fused image 1 for getting the final fused image with good clarity for the abnormality detection. Several image fusion techniques have been proposed so for, few among them is considered here for performance analysis. The methodology considered here include discrete wavelet transform (DWT), principal component analysis (PCA) and dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). The performance measure considered here include fusion symmetry, standard deviation, mutual information, average gradient and entropy. Experimental results suggest that T2w and FLAIR fusion result is better for tumor detection using proposed method compared to other fusion results like T1w and T2w fusion, T1w and FLAIR fusion.

Particularly, FM0 encoding and Manchester encoding schemes are adopted for DSRC standards to obtain dc balance and ensure reliability of signal. Regardless, the code variance between FM0 and Manchester restricts the designer to design a fully reusable DSRC Encoder. To overcome this limitation, Similarity Oriented Logic Simplification technique was proposed, which will result in improving the hardware utilization rate to 100% so that power and area can be reduced. Radio Frequency Identification [RFID] technology is one of the noteworthy converging technologies in this era. They are used in many fields including Logistics and Supply Chain, Race timing, Library system and so on. RFID technology can be implemented with Intelligent Transportation System, to make it applicable in Electronic Toll Collection system. For accommodating RFID in DSRC system, Miller encoding technique should be incorporated in this architecture. Miller encoding is widely used for encoding higher frequency radio signals. This project deals with the two types of encoding schemes such as FM0 and Manchester encoding that is used code the DSRC information and again encode it with miller codes for RFID communications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524444/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18248438","publicationDate":"April 2018","conferenceDate":"3-5 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8524444/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis of Cognitive Radio Spectrum Sensing Methods in Communication Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analysis of Cognitive Radio Spectrum Sensing Methods in Communication Networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070648S","chronDate":"3-5 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501332","isNumber":"8523828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8523828","articleId":"8524444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524461,"authors":[{"name":"Apoorva Raghunandan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering and Department of Telecommunication Engineering, R.

Attackers may try to handle the decision-making of the Fusion Center (FC) for selfish rationale or to interfere with the primary user transmission. This paper concentrates on one specific security threat in CRN called Byzantine attack. Also, known as Spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack. In SSDF attack, harmful users try to control the FC by sending fake sensing report. It plays a vital role in De-centralized network, where the attack resilience has been increased. The mitigation is free-based on fuzzy clustering algorithm. Fuzzy Clustering means (FCM) are proposed to mitigate the malicious user behavior than heretofore existing methods. The proposed approach improves the packet delivery ratio much larger than the preceding methods. The result has been taken in the time of packet transfer from one node to another node. The proposed research has been simulated in the Network Simulator software of Version 3. Robustness of this approach was favoured by simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"December 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18248647","htmlLink":"/document/8524462/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Clustering Means (FCM) for Mitigating Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) Attack in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Clustering Means (FCM) for Mitigating Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) Attack in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1700218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065209S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8501353","isNumber":"8523822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501353","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8523822","articleId":"8524462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524484,"authors":[{"name":"Humera Shaziya","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Osmania University"],"firstName":"Humera","lastName":"Shaziya","id":"37086407997"},{"name":"K.

Early detection of the disease can improve survival rate. Automation of detection of lung nodules aid radiologists in quickly and accurately diagnosing the disease. Developing computer aided diagnosis (CADx) systems for lung cancer is a challenging task. Several components make up CADx and one of the most significant components is lung segmentation. Segmentation of lungs is an essential prerequisite to efficiently detect and classify lung nodules. Lung segmentation is the process of segregating lungs region from other tissues in the CT image. Conventional methods for lung segmentation either do not accurately segments normal and abnormal lungs or rely heavily on user generated features for the lungs. Deep learning has outperformed other methods in image processing and computer vision tasks. An architecture called U-Net convolutional network has been proposed and implemented exclusively for the segmentation of biomedical images. In this study U-Net ConvNet has been implemented on lungs dataset to perform lungs segmentation. The lungs dataset consists of 267 CT images of lungs and their corresponding segmentation maps. The accuracy and loss achieved is 0.9678 and 0.0871 respectively.

The power loss of a DC line is lower than that of a corresponding AC line of the same power rating. The HVDC transmission based on Voltage Source Converters (VSC) uses IGBT's (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) and PWM technique maintain the desired level voltage. This paper proposes the modern adaptive backstepping controller for Voltage Sourced Converter (VSC) based HVDC. The adaptive backstepping controller adapts non linear nature of the VSC based HVDC systems which uses parameter uncertainties. The Lyapunov functions are adapted to deduce the control laws by step by step procedure. Based on the adaptive backstepping method, the final control law can be deduced step by step. The performance of the proposed controller has been investigated under different operating conditions like step changes in active and reactive power, including post fault recovery. The efficacy of the implemented backstepping controller is presented with VSC based HVDC Transmission systems with digital simulation tool of PSCAD/EMTDC.

Multi-Input and Multi-Output cognitive radio networks (MIMO-CRN) comprise primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) to cooperatively relay the primary traffic. It is extremely complicated to assign channel allocation and resources distribution in heterogeneous networks. The channel selection of SUs should fulfill rate and delay constraints of respective SUs. To overcome this issue we can formulate an efficient dynamic resource allocation technique which should uses very reliable nodes for efficient data transmission. The resources are allocated dynamically after ensuring that the nodes fulfill the specified constraints. This proposed framework should leads to effective data transmission and offer significant network throughput performance by comparing with the existing DRA-CRN algorithm and the simulation results shows that 27% more efficient than existing DSA-CRN algorithm. Furthermore limits the interference at PUs and it should avoid collision.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501353/8523822/08524549.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2017.8524549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2017.8524549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8523822","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priority Based Dynamic Resource Allocation in MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Dynamic scheduling","Delays","Data communication","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum resources","data transmission","dynamic resource allocation technique","multiinput multioutput cognitive radio networks","DSA-CRN algorithm","heterogeneous networks","channel allocation","primary traffic","secondary users","MIMO-CRN","radio resources","MIMO cognitive radio networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DSA;MIMO;SINR;Delay;Sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Priority Based Dynamic Resource Allocation in MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8524549/","publicationDate":"December 2017","accessionNumber":"18248639","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priority Based Dynamic Resource Allocation in MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1700039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04303S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8501353","isNumber":"8523822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501353","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8523822","articleId":"8524549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524554,"authors":[{"name":"Enakshi Jana","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry"],"firstName":"Enakshi","lastName":"Jana","id":"37086507779"},{"name":"Ravi Subban","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Subban","id":"38667123800"},{"name":"S.

The skin cancer detection technology is broadly divided into four basic components, viz., image preprocessing which includes hair removal, de-noise, sharpening, resize of the given skin image, segmentation which is used for segmenting out the region of interest from the given image. Different methods can be used for segmentation. Some commonly used segmentation algorithms are k-means, threshold in histogram etc., features extraction from the segmented image and classification of the image from the features set extracted from segmented image. Different classification algorithms can be used for this purpose. The recent skin cancer detection technology uses machine learning and deep learning based algorithms for classification. The most commonly used classification algorithms are support vector machine (SVM), feed forward artificial neural network, deep convolutional neural network.

There are various issues required to be addressed before the effective use of UAVs to form a stable and reliable network.

Direct trust is aggregated with are commendation to compute final trust value of a node. Further, nodes are classified into various clusters and trust values of uncertain nodes undergo risk assessment. Based on risk assessment, nodes are included in the recommendation or discard list. Hence, malicious nodes are segregated from the network using the discard list. The experimental results show that the proposed model has better adaptability and accuracy to be considered for FANETs.

The authors have developed approaches to data pickup and analysis, which have permitted to design a flexible measuring instrument that meets all the safety requirements for electrical measurements on the traffic safety systems; this approach is capable of ensuring transmission and further processing of the measurements under a Bluetooth protocol to a mobile device.

Using sensor fusion, the information from the sensors and the characteristics of each sensor can be used together to improve the estimate and decrease the uncertainty of the measured variables. In this paper a real-time pose estimation algorithm using sensor fusion of visual odometry (optical flow), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements is presented. The IMU contains calibrated three degrees of freedom (3Dof) accelerometer and an also 3DoF gyroscope. A Kalman filter is used for the fusion of the measurements of the different sensors.

Single Event Upsets (SEUs) are faults caused by a charged particle in the configuration memory of SRAM-based FPGAs. Such a charged particle can cause incorrect behavior in the whole system. This problem becomes greater if such a system operates in an environment with increased radiation (e.g. space applications). Lots of techniques to harden FPGAs against faults exist and new techniques targeted to FPGA are in scope of many researchers. One such technique is called Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). It is important to evaluate these techniques on a real system with a real FPGA. An evaluation platform based on an artificial fault injection and a functional verification for testing fault tolerance methodologies is introduced in this paper. Parts of our experimental system are hardened by using TMR and its experimental evaluation is one of the main parts of this paper. In this paper, we focus on the TMR fault tolerance method and change the target functional unit, on which the method is applied. This allows us to determine the reliability gain obtained through the hardening of a particular functional unit and allows us to compare the results. We propose experiments with various fault injection strategies (multiple and single faults) and monitor impact of faults on both the electronic and mechanical parts of the experimental system.","doi":"10.1109/EWDTS.2018.8524627","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8502702/8524135/08524627.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EWDTS.2018.8524627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524135","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Experimental Evaluation of Fault-Tolerant FPGA-Based Robot Controller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Experimental Evaluation of Fault-Tolerant FPGA-Based Robot Controller","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524627/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18248757","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8524627/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Experimental Evaluation of Fault-Tolerant FPGA-Based Robot Controller","confLoc":"Kazan, Russia","sourcePdf":"ewdts18_65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055184S","chronDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8502702","isNumber":"8524135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8502702","xplore-issue":"8524135","articleId":"8524627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524640,"authors":[{"name":"Oleg V.

One or several QAM symbols are inserted between DPSK symbols, and the phase offset of QAM symbols is determined by the preceding DPSK symbol.

Along with Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) algorithm, simplified reception method is presented that is based on the use of demodulated DPSK symbols as pilot signals for demodulation of QAM symbols. Also, the technique is proposed for approximate theoretical calculation of the bit error probability for this scheme in the case of uncoded transmission. The simulation results show that, at the same spectral efficiency, proposed scheme provides significant power gain compared to DPSK (about 2.4 dB for spectral efficiency of 4 bits per symbol and about 6 dB for spectral efficiency of 6 bits per symbol).

In this regard, the development of new methods for solving it, is an urgent task. Considering that the time complexity finding the exact solution is a factorial or exponential dependence on the input data, there are many methods for approximate solution of TSP. In this case, algorithms based on probabilistic-directed search are popular. Among these are genetic and bio-inspired algorithms. This paper presents two new indicators in genetic algorithms (GA) for analyzing the degradation degree of the population. Special software was developed for the GA analysis, which was tested on the well-known benchmark: bier 127. A number of representation issues are discussed along with genetic Edge Recombination Crossover (ERX) and Partially-mapped crossover (PMX). Test results indicate that the GA with ERX gives an advantage in the diversity of the population in front of the GA with the PMX. The obtained information is useful for further genetic algorithm parameters settings. As a result, developed indicators can be used for forward estimation of the GA prospects even before applying it to a real task. They can be also used for parameter settings of the GA.","doi":"10.1109/EWDTS.2018.8524713","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EWDTS.2018.8524713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524135","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8502702/8524135/08524713.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some of the New Indicators in Genetic Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524713/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Some of the New Indicators in Genetic Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8524713/","accessionNumber":"18232296","publicationDate":"September 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some of the New Indicators in Genetic Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem","confLoc":"Kazan, Russia","sourcePdf":"ewdts18_109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09538S","chronDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8502702","isNumber":"8524135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8502702","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8524135","articleId":"8524713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8524728,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Panek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Panek","id":"37086021533"},{"name":"Jakub Lojda","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Lojda","id":"37085885740"},{"name":"Jakub Podivinsky","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Podivinsky","id":"37085407990"},{"name":"Zdenek Kotasek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Kotasek","id":"37378056100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5710-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5709-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5711-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-761X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2373-826X"}],"articleNumber":"8524728","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit faults","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Redundancy","Fault tolerant systems","Tools","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial dynamic reconfiguration","simulation-based evaluation","Field Programmable Gate Arrays","embedded systems","Single Event Upsets","space applications","fault masking","Triple Modular Redundancy","TMR system","malfunction module reconfiguration","fault repair","FPGA","SEU","fault tolerant system"]}],"abstract":"Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are popular not only for their wide range of usage in embedded systems, however, they are susceptible to radiation effects. Charged particles cause the so-called Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in their configuration memory. SEUs can induce failure of the whole system. This problem is fundamental for space applications where sun radiation is more considerable than in the Earth. Two main approaches to SEU mitigation technique exist: fault masking and repair. The most popular masking method is Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). For the faults repair, FPGA's capability of reconfiguration is used. It is possible to combine these approaches to obtain improved fault tolerant system. It is important to assess reliability rate of this system and, therefore, its estimation by a simulation is the main part of this paper. We propose evaluation environment which assesses the reliability of a TMR system with malfunction module reconfiguration depending on faults occurrence frequency and reconfiguration time necessary for fault repair.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration in an FPGA-based Fault-Tolerant System: Simulation-based Evaluation","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)","doi":"10.1109/EWDTS.2018.8524728","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8502702/8524135/08524728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EWDTS.2018.8524728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration in an FPGA-based Fault-Tolerant System: Simulation-based Evaluation","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8524728/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18232301","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration in an FPGA-based Fault-Tolerant System: Simulation-based Evaluation","confLoc":"Kazan, Russia","sourcePdf":"ewdts18_121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059809S","chronDate":"14-17 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8502702","isNumber":"8524135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8502702","xplore-issue":"8524135","articleId":"8524728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8524762,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey N.

To achieve these performance targets, a series of sophisticated technical solutions are proposed and analyzed to realize 32 ps synchronization accuracy, 51.36 Gb/s parallel data streaming, and high-precision calibration across multiple channels. Key functions and performance metrics are evaluated and verified in a microwave chamber.

The use cases of such vertical industries define qualitative and quantitative requirements unprecedented in the history of mobile network development. Autonomous vehicles, traffic light control, video surveillance, and IIoT, to only name a few, introduce challenging requirements regarding both conventional performance metrics, such as throughput and coverage, as well as formerly rather subordinate system metrics, such as deterministic latency, ultra-high reliability and resilience, high number of devices, multi-tenant networks, and demanding security mechanisms. Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, and Hamburg Port Authority have deployed a largescale 5G trial testbed in the Hamburg port area. The testbed proves in a real, large-scale industrial environment that basic features of network slicing, namely slice isolation, flexible slice customization, and multitenancy, are already technically feasible. Three exemplary communication services have been selected and are demonstrated in the testbed. Multi-connectivity is implemented as a key component to achieve high reliability throughout the testbed area. The testbed shows that all network domains must be involved in the setup of network slices, that is, user terminals, radio access, core network, and enterprise networks, in order to efficiently operate and manage network slices. Therefore, the discussed life cycle management is key for the interaction between mobile service provider and tenants of the network.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2018.1800045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/8524878/08524894.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2018.1800045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524878","startPage":"48","endPage":"55","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Customized Industrial Networks: Network Slicing Trial at Hamburg Seaport","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8524894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Customized Industrial Networks: Network Slicing Trial at Hamburg Seaport","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8524894/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2018","accessionNumber":"18248124","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8524894/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Customized Industrial Networks: Network Slicing Trial at Hamburg Seaport","sourcePdf":"014ROST_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065618S","chronDate":"October  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"8524878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8524878","articleId":"8524894","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8525077,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey V.

In each of the different gate voltage regions, a physical model is proposed and compared to experiment. At negative gate bias, Poole-Frenkel emission (PFE) occurs within the passivation dielectric from gate to source. At positive gate bias, the p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN \u201cp-i-n\u201d diode is in forward operation mode, and the gate current is limited by hole supply at the Schottky contact. At low gate voltages, the current is governed by thermionic emission with Schottky barrier lowering in dislocation lines. Increasing the gate voltage and temperature results in thermally assisted tunneling (TAT) across the same barrier. An improved gate process reduces the gate current in the positive gate bias region and eliminates the onset of TAT.

The novel observer is a linear descriptor reduced-order one.

Due to this characteristic of multispectral images, multispectral face recognition has attracted lots of research interest. Although some multispectral face recognition methods have been presented in the last decade, how to fully and effectively explore the intraspectrum discriminant information and the useful interspectrum correlation information in multispectral face images for recognition has not been well studied. To boost the performance of multispectral face recognition, we propose an intraspectrum discrimination and interspectrum correlation analysis deep network (IDICN) approach. Multiple spectra are divided into several spectrum-sets, with each containing a group of spectra within a small spectral range. The IDICN network contains a set of spectrum-set-specific deep convolutional neural networks attempting to extract spectrum-set-specific features, followed by a spectrum pooling layer, whose target is to select a group of spectra with favorable discriminative abilities adaptively. IDICN jointly learns the nonlinear representations of the selected spectra, such that the intraspectrum Fisher loss and the interspectrum discriminant correlation are minimized. Experiments on the well-known Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Western Australia multispectral face datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intraspectrum Discrimination and Interspectrum Correlation Analysis Deep Network for Multispectral Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2018.2876591","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8964604/08525134.pdf","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2018.2876591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8964604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","displayDocTitle":"Intraspectrum Discrimination and Interspectrum Correlation Analysis Deep Network for Multispectral Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8525134/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2020","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19296815","pubMedId":"30418895","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702280"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012152","fundingName":"National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents","grantNumber":"BX20180146"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1736211"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2017YFB1401302, 2017YFB0202204 and 2017YFB1401301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20170900"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BE2017166"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010035","fundingName":"Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20170100"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Fund for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"17KJB520025"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Staring Foundation for Introduced Talents in NJUPT (NUPTSF)","grantNumber":"NY217009"},{"fundingName":"1311 Project of NJUPT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intraspectrum Discrimination and Interspectrum Correlation Analysis Deep Network for Multispectral Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tcyb-jing-2876591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137937S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8964604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8964604","articleId":"8525134","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8525137,"authors":[{"name":"Aamir Anis","affiliation":["Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Aamir Anis received his Bachelors and Masters of Technology degrees in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India in 2012 and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles in 2017.","He is the recipient of the Best Student Paper award at the ICASSP 2014 conference held in Florence, Italy.

It is often desirable for the constructed graph to satisfy two properties: first, data points that are similar in the feature space should be strongly connected on the graph, and second, the class label information should vary smoothly with respect to the graph, where smoothness is measured using the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian matrix. Recent works have justified some of these smoothness conditions by showing that they are strongly linked to the semi-supervised smoothness assumption and its variants. In this work, we reinforce this connection by viewing the problem from a graph sampling theoretic perspective, where class indicator functions are treated as bandlimited graph signals (in the eigenvector basis of the graph Laplacian) and label prediction as a bandlimited reconstruction problem. Our approach involves analyzing the bandwidth of class indicator signals generated from statistical data models with separable and nonseparable classes. These models are quite general and mimic the nature of most real-world datasets. Our results show that in the asymptotic limit, the bandwidth of any class indicator is also closely related to the geometry of the dataset. This allows one to theoretically justify the assumption of bandlimitedness of class indicator signals, thereby providing a sampling theoretic interpretation of graph-based semi-supervised classification.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2018.2879897","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8667931/08525137.pdf","startPage":"2322","endPage":"2342","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2018.2879897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8667931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sampling Theory Perspective of Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8667931/8525137-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Sampling Theory Perspective of Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning","volume":"65","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2019","accessionNumber":"18524149","publicationDate":"April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8525137/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1410009, CCF-1527874, CCF-1408639 and NETS-1419632"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"108818"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Sampling Theory Perspective of Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning","sourcePdf":"tit-anis-2879897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104031S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8667931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8667931","articleId":"8525137","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":8525141,"authors":[{"name":"A R Suraj","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering, R.V.

This leads to the huge accumulation of data on the cloud. The existing security provisions for cloud accessing techniques are proved to be inoperable or inadequate and highly vulnerable to security threats through the earlier studies. Because this problem is of highest concern it should be dealt with highest priority. Thus the three service models of cloud computing, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), are to be made highly secure. As an initiative to provide relatively high security to user data on the cloud, a new security feature in cloud computing model is preferred. In this paper, a top notch security model with maximum security approaches that can be implemented practically is proposed to safeguard the user's data present on the cloud.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501333/8525138/08525141.pdf","startPage":"018","endPage":"022","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCPEIC.2018.8525141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPEIC.2018.8525141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Security Model for Cloud Computing Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Computational modeling","Software as a service","Monitoring","Virtual machining","Platform as a service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network services","cloud accessing techniques","security threats","service models","cloud computing model","security model","Internet","infrastructure as a service","platform as a service","software as a service","IaaS","PaaS","SaaS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud","Security","Model","Iaas","PaaS","SaaS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Security Model for Cloud Computing Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8525141/","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"18220360","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"28-29 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Security Model for Cloud Computing Applications","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"IC117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062288S","chronDate":"28-29 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501333","isNumber":"8525138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501333","xplore-issue":"8525138","articleId":"8525141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525147,"authors":[{"name":"S Revathi","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College, Puducherry, India"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Revathi","id":"37085887646"},{"name":"K Vithya","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College, Puducherry, India"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Vithya","id":"37086507971"},{"name":"T.

It is difficult for the user to identify who is an honest co-tenant because users are unidentified. Cloud providers are responsible for assigning the co-tenants to the users and the wrong behaviors of users will affect the reputation of the cloud provider. The objective of this article is to explore the importance in reputation management mechanism in cloud. Further it also explores about the existing techniques and models used in reputation management mechanism in cloud. The effectiveness of the reputation management can be calculated by various analytical and experimental analysis.

The issues resulting from the fraud in credit card transaction may involve a number of customers who drift their habits evolve and fraudsters who change their strategies over time. The vast majority of learning algorithms that have been proposed for fraud detection rely on assumptions that hardly hold in a real-world fraud-detection system. This includes the classification of data imbalance which is used to verify their hidden transaction, track the location of the fraudsters and to capture their image. The implementation of learning algorithm will precisely predict and rank alerts based on the scores allotted to each alert. Initially, we propose transaction blocking rule to ensure the security of the transaction. Secondly, we design scoring rules that involve pattern matching based on frequent data mining techniques. Finally, the machine is trained and updated with the dataset to timely investigate the transaction thereby earning credit card holder's satisfaction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPEIC.2018.8525171","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501333/8525138/08525171.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"196","doi":"10.1109/ICCPEIC.2018.8525171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Learning to Rank Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Learning to Rank Approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-29 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525171/","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"18232224","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525171/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Learning to Rank Approach","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"MR122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05824S","chronDate":"28-29 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501333","isNumber":"8525138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501333","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8525138","articleId":"8525171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8525234,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph P.

Utilization of dynamic MGs can provide more flexible solutions toward distribution system restoration from natural disasters. This paper proposes a distributed secondary control strategy for dynamic MG operation under both static topology and topology variation. The proposed control strategy aims to guarantee seamless transitions during dynamic MG reconfiguration and proper power management among distributed generators (DGs) that are grouped dynamically. Smart switches (SSWs) are utilized to identify, process, and implement the reconfiguration request. The proposed control strategy provides a framework to coordinate the operation of multiple DGs in neighboring autonomous MGs and determine the operation status of SSWs, so that no transient over-shoots are introduced as SSWs operate and DGs are able to support the system power demand proportionally. Detailed controller designs are provided. Sufficient conditions under which the proposed controllers are exponentially stable are derived and the dynamic performance of the proposed controller are validated by comprehensive case studies in MATLAB/Simulink.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2018.2879793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8809237/08525259.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2018.2879793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8809237","startPage":"5269","endPage":"5282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Secondary Control Strategy for Microgrid Operation with Dynamic Boundaries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525259","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/8809237/8525259-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Secondary Control Strategy for Microgrid Operation with Dynamic Boundaries","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525259/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18938021","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8525259/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"34230"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Distributed Secondary Control Strategy for Microgrid Operation with Dynamic Boundaries","sourcePdf":"tsg-lu-2879793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217719S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8809237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8809237","articleId":"8525259","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8525260,"authors":[{"name":"Kaixing Dong","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/8926561/8525260/dong-2879862-small.gif","p":["Kaixing Dong received the bachelor's degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2017.

This calls for high-throughput trajectory query processing. Traditional in-memory databases lack considerations of the unique features of trajectories, while specialized trajectory query processing systems are typically designed for only one type of trajectory queries. This paper introduces GAT, a unified GPU-accelerated framework to process batch trajectory queries with the objective of high throughput. GAT follows the filtering-and-verification paradigm where we develop a novel index GTIDX for effectively filtering invalid trajectories on the CPU, and exploit the massive parallelism of the GPU for verification. To optimize the performance of GAT, we first greedily partition batch queries to reduce the amortized query processing latency. We then apply the Morton-based encoding method to coalesce data access requests from the GPU cores, and maintain a hash table to avoid redundant data transfer between CPU and GPU. To achieve load balance, we group size-varying cells into balanced blocks with similar numbers of trajectory points. Extensive experiments have been conducted over real-life trajectory datasets. The results show that GAT is efficient, scalable, and achieves high throughput with acceptable indexing cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/8926561/08525260.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2018.2879862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2018.2879862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8926561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GAT: A Unified GPU-Accelerated Framework for Processing Batch Trajectory Queries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Graphics processing units","Query processing","Indexes","Throughput","Public transportation","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","parallel processing","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GAT","unified GPU-accelerated framework","trajectory data","partition batch queries","real-life trajectory datasets","batch trajectory queries processing","query processing latency","index GTIDX","data access requests","data transfer","high-throughput trajectory query processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial-temporal trajectory","range query","top- $k$   k     similarity query","GTIDX","GPGPU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"GAT: A Unified GPU-Accelerated Framework for Processing Batch Trajectory Queries","volume":"32","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8525260/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19291975","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFC0831600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61602297, 61772341, 61472254, 61572324, 61170238 and 61472241"},{"fundingName":"Changjiang Young Scholars in the University of China"},{"fundingName":"China Top Young Talents"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Top Young Talents"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GAT: A Unified GPU-Accelerated Framework for Processing Batch Trajectory Queries","sourcePdf":"tkde-shen-2879862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.289154S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"8926561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8926561","articleId":"8525260","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8525261,"authors":[{"name":"Bining Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus,, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8694093/8525261/zhao-2879801-small.gif","p":["Bining Zhao (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation from North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China, in 2014.

Pipeline constraints require power system operators to account for natural gas-supply restrictions in their operational processes. This paper proposes separate optimization models for clearing day-ahead wholesale markets for scheduling power and natural gas systems. We then develop a market-based mechanism that allows for efficient co-ordination of the two systems. Importantly, the co-ordination mechanism only requires the exchange of fuel-price, -supply, and -demand information between the two markets. This can be contrasted with other co-ordination mechanisms that require operations of the two systems by a single entity. Thus, we provide a computationally tractable co-ordination mechanism that does not require the exchange of proprietary information between natural gas and electricity system operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the technique using a numerical example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shadow Price-Based Co-Ordination of Natural Gas and Electric Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2879801","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8694093/08525261.pdf","startPage":"1942","endPage":"1954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2879801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8694093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525261","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/59/8694093/8525261-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","displayDocTitle":"Shadow Price-Based Co-Ordination of Natural Gas and Electric Power Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8525261/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18617192","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1548015"},{"fundingName":"DOE Awards","grantNumber":"DE-AR0000673 and DEAC52-06NA25396"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Shadow Price-Based Co-Ordination of Natural Gas and Electric Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-sioshansi-2879801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126553S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8694093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8694093","articleId":"8525261","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":8525264,"authors":[{"name":"He Qi","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Qi","orcid":"0000-0002-0348-5125","id":"37086925082"},{"name":"Zhi Guo Feng","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Guangdong Ocean University, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhi Guo","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086930947"},{"name":"Ka Fai Cedric Yiu","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Ka Fai Cedric","lastName":"Yiu","orcid":"0000-0002-7523-4069","id":"38181160400"},{"name":"Sven Nordholm","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Nordholm","orcid":"0000-0001-8942-5328","id":"37274680800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8525264","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Circuit stability","Transfer functions","Optimization","Circuits and systems","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decomposition","IIR filters","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transfer function decomposition","second order decomposition formulation","stability condition","minimax IIR filter design problem","low order fractions","infinite impulse response filter","minimax design","partial fraction decomposition method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IIR digital filter","minimax design","partial fraction decomposition"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, we consider the minimax design of infinite impulse response (IIR) filter.

The ECG signals acquired by capacitively coupled electrodes are sampled with LCS in place of conventional synchronous sampling. In order to transmit signals through HBC at low frequencies (100 kHz, 1 MHz), an electric field sensor with high input impedance is adopted as the front end of the HBC receiver. The HBC channel gain is enhanced by more than 30 dB with the electric field sensor. An LCS structure based on the send-on-delta concept is implemented with discrete components to convert the ECG signals into binary impulses. The converted impulses are modulated by an on-off keying modulator and then transmitted via the human body to the receiver. A prototype ECG waist belt is developed with commercially available components and experimentally evaluated. The results indicate that the acquired ECG waveforms exhibit good agreement with regular Ag/AgCl ECG methods.

Trapping sets are graphical structures responsible for error floor of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and are well investigated in coding theory.

Based on the connection between cages and trapping sets, we then use the available results in graph theory on cages and derive tight upper bounds on the size of the smallest trapping sets for variable-regular LDPC codes with a given variable degree and girth. The derived upper bounds in many cases meet the best known lower bounds and thus provide the actual size of the smallest trapping sets. Considering that non-zero codewords are a special case of trapping sets, we also derive tight upper bounds on the minimum weight of such codewords, i.e., the minimum distance, of variable-regular LDPC codes as a function of variable degree and girth.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2018.2879823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8667931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2018.2879823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8667931/08525278.pdf","startPage":"2062","endPage":"2074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Cages to Trapping Sets and Codewords: A Technique to Derive Tight Upper Bounds on the Minimum Size of Trapping Sets and Minimum Distance of LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"From Cages to Trapping Sets and Codewords: A Technique to Derive Tight Upper Bounds on the Minimum Size of Trapping Sets and Minimum Distance of LDPC Codes","volume":"65","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8525278/","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18524160","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525278/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"217239-2013-RGPIN"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Cages to Trapping Sets and Codewords: A Technique to Derive Tight Upper Bounds on the Minimum Size of Trapping Sets and Minimum Distance of LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-banihashemi-2879823-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153616S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8667931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8667931","articleId":"8525278","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525287,"authors":[{"name":"Kapil Jainwal","affiliation":["ECE Department, LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Kapil","lastName":"Jainwal","orcid":"0000-0002-2337-6321","id":"38189472900"},{"name":"Chandani Anand","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Chandani","lastName":"Anand","orcid":"0000-0002-5296-3824","id":"37901669700"},{"name":"Mukul Sarkar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Mukul","lastName":"Sarkar","orcid":"0000-0002-4958-8787","id":"37394227700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-9603"}],"articleNumber":"8525287","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":998},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-frequency noise","Photodiodes","Choppers (circuits)","Switches","1/f noise","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1/f noise","CMOS image sensors","integrated circuit design","low-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chopping frequency","CMOS image sensors","in-pixel chopping technique","source follower transistor","active pixel sensor","SF low-frequency noise","low-pass filtering","in-pixel chopping read-out circuit","column-level read-out circuit","1/f noise reduction","AMS CMOS OPTO process","pixel array","size 10.5 mum","frequency 8.0 MHz","frequency 1.0 Hz to 20.0 kHz","frequency 4 MHz","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1/f noise","chopper amplifier","CMOS image sensors","dynamic range (DR)","low-frequency noise"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, an in-pixel chopping technique to reduce the low-frequency or 1/f noise of the source follower (SF) transistor in an active pixel sensor (APS) is presented.

To enhance the discriminant ability of the learned basis, discriminant graph embedding is usually introduced in the matrix factorization model. However, the existing matrix factorization methods based on graph embedding generally conduct discriminant analysis via a single type of adjacency graph, either similarity-based graphs (e.g., Laplacian eigenmaps graph) or reconstruction-based graphs (e.g., L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-graph), while ignoring the cooperation of the different types of adjacency graphs that can better depict the discriminant structure of original data. To address the above issue, we propose a novel Fisher-like criterion, based on graph embedding, to extract sufficient discriminant information via two different types of adjacency graphs. One graph preserves the reconstruction relationships of neighboring samples in the same category, and the other suppresses the similarity relationships of neighboring samples from different categories. Moreover, we also leverage the sparse coding to promote the sparsity of the coefficients. By virtue of the proposed Fisher-like criterion and sparse coding, a new matrix factorization framework called Sparse concept Discriminant Matrix Factorization (SDMF) is proposed for efficient image representation. Furthermore, we extend the Fisher-like criterion to an unsupervised context, thus yielding an unsupervised version of SDMF. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SDMFs on both image classification and clustering tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19100182","volume":"29","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8525292/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Toward Efficient Image Representation: Sparse Concept Discriminant Matrix Factorization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672444, 61272366 and 61672125"},{"fundingName":"SZSTI","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160531194006833"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001747","fundingName":"Hong Kong Baptist University","grantNumber":"FRG2/17-18/082"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002663","fundingName":"Northwestern Polytechnical University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Efficient Image Representation: Sparse Concept Discriminant Matrix Factorization","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-cheung-2879833-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134663S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8886618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8886618","articleId":"8525292","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8525300,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

If organs could be moved by drone, instead of ill-timed commercial aircraft or expensive charter flights, lifesaving organs could be transplanted more quickly. A modified, six-rotor UAS was used to model situations relevant to organ transportation. To monitor the organ, we developed novel technologies that provided the real-time organ status using a wireless biosensor combined with an organ global positioning system. Fourteen drone organ missions were performed. Temperatures remained stable and low (2.5 \u00b0C). Pressure changes (0.37-0.86 kPa) correlated with increased altitude. Drone travel was associated with less vibration (<;0.5 G) than was observed with fixed-wing flight (>2.0 G). Peak velocity was 67.6 km/h (42 m/h). Biopsies of the kidney taken prior to and after organ shipment revealed no damage resulting from drone travel. The longest flight was 3.0 miles, modeling an organ flight between two inner city hospitals. Organ transportation may be an ideal use-case for drones. With the development of faster, larger drones, long-distance drone organ shipment may result in substantially reduced cold ischemia times, subsequently improved organ quality, and thousands of lives saved.","doi":"10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2875704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221039/8253365/08525303.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2875704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8253365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Initial Investigation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Real-Time Organ Status Measurement for Transporting Human Organs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"An Initial Investigation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Real-Time Organ Status Measurement for Transporting Human Organs","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"externalId":"4000107","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18545808","pubMedId":"30464862","htmlLink":"/document/8525303/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008510","fundingName":"University of Maryland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Initial Investigation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Real-Time Organ Status Measurement for Transporting Human Organs","sourcePdf":"jtehm-scalea-2875704-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0811S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221039","isNumber":"8253365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221039","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8253365","articleId":"8525303","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8525316,"authors":[{"name":"Padma Iyenghar","affiliation":["Software Engineering Research Group, University of Osnabr\u00fcck, Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8614370/8525316/iyeng-2879746-small.gif","p":["Padma Iyenghar received the doctoral degree from the University of Osnabr\u00fcck, Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany, in 2012.","She is a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Osnabr\u00fcck, where she is a Project Manager with the Software Engineering Research Group.

Several IoT platforms, with support for rich set of device libraries, facilitate rapid development of embedded IoT applications. But, none of the approaches deal with an early analysis of performance characteristics such as energy and timing properties. Such analysis (and feedback) during early design stages would help in identifying problems in meeting the performance attributes, reduce development time/effort, and deliver better quality without budget overshoot. Addressing this gap, a novel, generic workflow to carry out a quick, early, model-driven, system-level energy-aware timing validation of IoT-enabled hand-written code in specialized timing analysis tools, such as SymTA/S, is proposed in this paper. A prototype of the workflow is realized using a light-weight interfacing tool framework (with plug-ins) employing the Eclipse environment. A discussion on the various implementation aspects of the workflow and its qualitative and quantitative analysis based on experiments on real-world, model-based, IoT-enabled use cases of varying complexities is presented. The IoT-enabled emission monitoring system described in this paper is a full-fledged use case (in its completeness) and tested including live data captured from emission monitoring with the IBM Watson IoT platform. A tradeoff analysis among the energy and timing characteristics of an IoT-enabled automotive real-time emission monitoring use case, with the aid of the workflow/prototype implementation is presented in a timing-energy analysis tool. The main benefit of the proposed workflow is the feedback regarding energy and timing characteristics of the IoT-enabled application, early during development stages. Such analysis results providing early feed back regarding performance characteristics (load and schedulability) of the IoT application software system can be termed as a breakthrough for software architects and design engineers toward realizing reliable and cutting edge IoT-enabled systems.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2879746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2879746","startPage":"4914","endPage":"4925","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8614370/08525316.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8614370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Driven Workflow for Energy-Aware Scheduling Analysis of IoT-Enabled Use Cases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Workflow for Energy-Aware Scheduling Analysis of IoT-Enabled Use Cases","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2019","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8525316/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525316/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"KF2312004KM4 from BMWi-ZIM co-operation, Germany"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Workflow for Energy-Aware Scheduling Analysis of IoT-Enabled Use Cases","sourcePdf":"jiot-iyenghar-2879746-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078568S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8614370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8614370","articleId":"8525316","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":8525318,"authors":[{"name":"Sulei Wang","affiliation":["Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Sulei","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-0623-6378","id":"37086110308"},{"name":"Zhe Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085380894"},{"name":"Yuedong Xu","affiliation":["Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuedong","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0003-4168-3998","id":"37085503282"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"38667934800"},{"name":"Qingsheng Kong","affiliation":["Research Center of Smart Networks and Systems, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qingsheng","lastName":"Kong","id":"37086285379"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8525318","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Bandwidth","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","integer programming","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radiofrequency interference","software radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic indoor environments","optimal throughput","software defined radio system","legacy 802.11ac","channel vector projection","low-complexity branch-and-prune algorithm","estimated signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio","next generation multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output wireless local area networks","MU-MIMO WLANs","important components","heterogeneous bandwidth","practical user selection","user antennas","low-complexity branch","heterogeneous users","novel integer optimization framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MU-MIMO","user selection","heterogeneity","branch-and-prune"]}],"abstract":"User selection is one of the most important components for next generation multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output wireless local area networks. However, state-of-the-art approaches neglect the heterogeneity of users in the available bandwidth and the number of antennas, which diminishes their performance considerably. To tackle this challenge, we formulate a novel integer optimization framework to select the antennas of heterogeneous users simultaneously. With estimated signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio of users via channel vector projection, we propose a low-complexity branch-and-prune algorithm to search for the near-optimal combinations of user antennas. Our algorithm is compatible with legacy 802.11ac and is implemented on the software defined radio system. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm achieves around 95% of the optimal throughput and outperforms a benchmark scheme with a $1.18\\boldsymbol \\times $ gain in realistic indoor environments.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2018.2879668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8685245/08525318.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2018.2879668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8685245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical User Selection With Heterogeneous Bandwidth and Antennas for MU-MIMO WLANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525318/","displayDocTitle":"Practical User Selection With Heterogeneous Bandwidth and Antennas for MU-MIMO WLANs","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18598646","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8525318/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772139"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai\u2013Hong Kong Collaborative Project","grantNumber":"18510760900"},{"fundingName":"CERNET Innovation Project","grantNumber":"NGII20170209"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical User Selection With Heterogeneous Bandwidth and Antennas for MU-MIMO WLANs","sourcePdf":"lwc-xu-2879668-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047485S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8685245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8685245","articleId":"8525318","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8525324,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Esrafilian","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, EURECOM, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8525324/esraf-2879682-small.gif","p":["Omid Esrafilian (S\u201917) received the B.Sc. degree in control and electrical engineering and M.Sc. degree (First Rank) from the K.

While the problem of throughput optimized trajectories has been addressed in prior works, the formulation of an optimized trajectory to efficiently discover the propagation parameters has not yet been addressed. When it comes to the communication phase, the advantage of this paper comes from the exploitation of a 3-D city map. Unfortunately, the communication trajectory design based on the raw map data leads to an intractable optimization problem. To solve this issue, we introduce a map compression method that allows us to tackle the problem with standard optimization tools. The trajectory optimization is then combined with a node scheduling algorithm. The advantages of the learning-optimized trajectory and of the map compression method are illustrated in the context of intelligent Internet of Things data harvesting.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2879682","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2879682","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8709863/08525324.pdf","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8709863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Communicate in UAV-Aided Wireless Networks: Map-Based Approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning to Communicate in UAV-Aided Wireless Networks: Map-Based Approaches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18653881","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8525324/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"H2020 European Research Council","grantNumber":"670896"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Communicate in UAV-Aided Wireless Networks: Map-Based Approaches","sourcePdf":"jiot-esrafilian-2879682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067661S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8525324","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525328,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Ye","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Circuits and Intelligent Information Processing, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Ye","orcid":"0000-0002-7242-6065","id":"37086099047"},{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Circuits and Intelligent Information Processing, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086236520"},{"name":"Hongjiang Lei","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjiang","lastName":"Lei","orcid":"0000-0002-9070-6300","id":"38238073300"},{"name":"Gaofeng Pan","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Circuits and Intelligent Information Processing, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Pan","orcid":"0000-0003-1008-5717","id":"37600445100"},{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278653500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8525328","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2068},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525328","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Eavesdropping","Receivers","Fading channels","Security","Signal to noise ratio","Communications systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","Monte Carlo methods","probability","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicle-to-UAV system","eavesdropping UAVs","legitimate UAV receiver links","Monte-Carlo simulations","average secrecy capacity","secrecy outage probability","closed-form analytical expressions","secure UAV-to-UAV systems","spatially random UAVs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Average secrecy capacity","secrecy outage probability","stochastic geometry","unmanned aerial vehicles"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the secrecy performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-UAV system, where a UAV acts as the source (S) transmitting information to a legitimate UAV receiver while a group of UAVs trying to eavesdrop the information delivery between S and legitimate UAV receiver.

To this end, the newly invented spinal codes are used as the outer codes, which are characterized by its great error correcting capability even when the message length is short. First, the proposed codes, named spinal-polar, is implemented through an interleaved concatenation scheme. A joint iterative decoding algorithm is proposed accordingly, and the decoding complexity of the algorithm is also analyzed. Second, in order to reduce the decoding complexity of the full concatenation while maintaining the BER performance, the partial concatenation scheme is presented. Finally, we propose a rate allocation algorithm to further improve the BER performance of the designed concatenated codes. Extensive simulations results indicate that the proposed spinal-polar codes have significant performance improvement over the stand-alone polar codes, and the other improvement strategies mentioned earlier have also been proved to be effective.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08525335.pdf","startPage":"70644","endPage":"70654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Short Polar Codes: A Concatenation Scheme Using Spinal Codes as the Outer Code","topic":"Advances in Channel Coding for 5G and Beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"High Performance Short Polar Codes: A Concatenation Scheme Using Spinal Codes as the Outer Code","volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18584931","htmlLink":"/document/8525335/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871147, 61771158 and 61831008"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Plan","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170811160142808 and JCYJ20170811154309920"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"High Performance Short Polar Codes: A Concatenation Scheme Using Spinal Codes as the Outer Code","sourcePdf":"access-wu-2879827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064018S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Advances in Channel Coding for 5G and Beyond"],"articleId":"8525335","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525342,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Rocca","affiliation":["ELEDIA Research Center, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8636396/8525342/rocca-2879778-small.gif","p":["Paolo Rocca (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201913) received the M.S. degree (summa cum laude) in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication technologies from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, and a member of the ELEDIA Research Center, Trento.

The first/primary beam is fixed and it is generated at the element level (EL) through the complex (amplitude and phase) weighting coefficients, while the second/secondary one is synthesized at the subarray level by aggregating the array elements into nonoverlapped clusters and using additional phase shifters at the clusters outputs. Toward this end, the subarray configuration is determined by means of an ad hoc iterative method aimed at reducing the unavoidable quantization lobes, while the synthesis of the subarray phase coefficients; once the excitations at the EL have been set, is cast as a phase-matching problem whose analytic solution is optimal since it guarantees the minimum least-square error with respect to a reference phase distribution. A set of representative numerical results is reported and discussed to validate the proposed design approach and to point out its features and potentialities when addressing the synthesis of both pencil and shaped-beam power patterns.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Optimized production technology","Frequency conversion","Phase shifters","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","iterative methods","least squares approximations","phase shifters","scanning antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array elements","nonoverlapped clusters","subarray configuration","ad hoc iterative method","reference phase distribution","shaped-beam power patterns","optimal phase-matching strategy","beam scanning","sub-arrayed phased arrays","functional beams","element level","subarray level","phase shifters","phased array antenna design","phase-matching problem","quantization lobes","complex weighting coefficients","subarray phase coefficient synthesis","analytic solution","minimum least-square error","pencil-beam power patterns","phase weighting coefficients","amplitude weighting coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active electronically scanned array","beam scanning","contiguous partition method","phase matching","subarraying"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2879778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8636396/08525342.pdf","startPage":"951","endPage":"959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8636396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2879778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Phase-Matching Strategy for Beam Scanning of Sub-Arrayed Phased Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Phase-Matching Strategy for Beam Scanning of Sub-Arrayed Phased Arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525342/","volume":"67","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8525342/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18452515","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FET Open CSA PROJECT NANOARCHITECTRONICS"},{"fundingName":"EU in the framework of the Horizon 2020\u2014the Framework Program for Research and Innovation (2014\u20132020)\u2014","grantNumber":"737135"},{"fundingName":"SNATCH Project (2017\u20132019)"},{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Directorate General for Cultural and Economic Promotion and Innovation"},{"fundingName":"Antenne al Plasma\u2013Tecnologia abilitante per SATCOM (ASI.EPT.COM) Project"},{"fundingName":"Italian Space Agency (ASI)","grantNumber":"2018-3-HH.0 (CUP: F91I17000020005)"},{"fundingName":"WATERTECH Project"},{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research within the Smart Cities and Communities and Social Innovation Program (CUP: E44G14000060008)","grantNumber":"SCN 00489"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Theory and Key Techniques of Electromagnetic Radiation and Scattering Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61721001"},{"fundingName":"Catedra de Excelencia UC3M-Santander"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006318","fundingName":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Phase-Matching Strategy for Beam Scanning of Sub-Arrayed Phased Arrays","sourcePdf":"tap-massa-2879778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107229S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8636396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8636396","articleId":"8525342","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8525343,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Novo","affiliation":["IoT Technologies Research Department, Ericsson Research, Jorvas, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8738925/8525343/novo-2879679-small.gif","p":["Oscar Novo received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication software from Aalto University, Espoo, Finland, and the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the Universidad Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.

The algorithm may be viewed as a significant improvement over other types of autocorrelation algorithms that appear in literature that lead to false alarm due to the hardware impairment of frequency offset. The algorithm works by making an unbiased estimate of the square of an autocorrelation coefficient and from that deduces an appropriate probability density function for the phase angle of the complex test statistic and thereby palliating the effect of phase distortion introduced by the frequency offset. It is shown that the algorithm presented in this paper can be implemented on a testbed, as well as overcome simulations that have been specifically designed to have worst case frequency offset phase distortion conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2879810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8612978/08525344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2879810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612978","startPage":"368","endPage":"378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Knowledge Autocorrelation-Based Algorithm for Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Signals in Channels With Frequency Offset","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Knowledge Autocorrelation-Based Algorithm for Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Signals in Channels With Frequency Offset","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18409566","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8525344/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/M014126/1"},{"fundingName":"Large Scale Antenna Systems Made Practical: Advanced Signal Processing for Compact Deployments and UGC-UKIERI","grantNumber":"2016-17-058"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Knowledge Autocorrelation-Based Algorithm for Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Signals in Channels With Frequency Offset","sourcePdf":"tvt-chambers-2879810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1077S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8612978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8612978","articleId":"8525344","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8525388,"authors":[{"name":"Kazim Rifat \u00d6zyilmaz","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kazim Rifat","lastName":"\u00d6zyilmaz","id":"37086318839"},{"name":"Mehmet Do\u011fan","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Do\u011fan","id":"37086523521"},{"name":"Arda Yurdakul","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Arda","lastName":"Yurdakul","id":"37298931200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7204-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7205-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525388","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1362},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525388","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Companies","Monitoring","Memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","electronic data interchange","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT data marketplace","data generation","artificial intelligence","IoT device vendors","trustless data marketplace","transparent data exchange platform","Ethereum blockchain","Internet of Things devices","IDMoB","machine learning","decentralized data marketplace","Swarm","distributed storage platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blockchain","iot","data marketplace","ethereum","swarm","decentralized"]}],"abstract":"Today, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the powerhouse of data generation with their ever-increasing numbers and widespread penetration.

On the other hand, AI/ML solutions will produce better results if training data is diverse and plentiful. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based, decentralized and trustless data marketplace where IoT device vendors and AI/ML solution providers may interact and collaborate. By facilitating a transparent data exchange platform, access to consented data will be democratized and the variety of services targeting end-users will increase. Proposed data marketplace is implemented as a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain and Swarm is used as the distributed storage platform.","doi":"10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00007","publicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8525353/8525381/08525388.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IDMoB: IoT Data Marketplace on Blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"IDMoB: IoT Data Marketplace on Blockchain","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525388/","accessionNumber":"18232827","publicationDate":"Jun 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IDMoB: IoT Data Marketplace on Blockchain","confLoc":"Zug, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"720401a011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073581S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8525353","isNumber":"8525381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8525353","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8525381","articleId":"8525388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525389,"authors":[{"name":"O\u011fuzhan Ersoy","affiliation":["Cyber Security Group, Delft university of of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"O\u011fuzhan","lastName":"Ersoy","id":"37086523484"},{"name":"Zhijie Ren","affiliation":["Cyber Security Group, Delft university of of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zhijie","lastName":"Ren","id":"37086523257"},{"name":"Zekeriya Erkin","affiliation":["Cyber Security Group, Delft university of of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zekeriya","lastName":"Erkin","id":"37705139300"},{"name":"Reginald L.

Unfortunately, there is no explicit incentive for such transaction propagation. Therefore, existing propagation mechanisms will not be sustainable in a fully decentralized blockchain with rational nodes. In this work, we formally define the problem of incentivizing nodes for transaction propagation. We propose an incentive mechanism where each node involved in the propagation of a transaction receives a share of the transaction fee. We also show that our proposal is Sybil-proof. Furthermore, we combine the incentive mechanism with smart routing to reduce the communication and storage costs at the same time. The proposed routing mechanism reduces the redundant transaction propagation from the size of the network to a factor of average shortest path length. The routing mechanism is built upon a specific type of consensus protocol where the round leader who creates the transaction block is known in advance. Note that our routing mechanism is a generic one and can be adopted independently from the incentive mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00008","publicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8525353/8525381/08525389.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transaction Propagation on Permissionless Blockchains: Incentive and Routing Mechanisms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Transaction Propagation on Permissionless Blockchains: Incentive and Routing Mechanisms","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525389/","accessionNumber":"18249055","publicationDate":"Jun 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transaction Propagation on Permissionless Blockchains: Incentive and Routing Mechanisms","confLoc":"Zug, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"720401a020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093373S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8525353","isNumber":"8525381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8525353","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8525381","articleId":"8525389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525392,"authors":[{"name":"Karl W\u00fcst","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, ETHZurich"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"W\u00fcst","id":"37086521227"},{"name":"Arthur Gervais","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College, London"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Gervais","id":"37086521245"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7204-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7205-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525392","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":10685},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Supply chain management","Bitcoin","Observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data integrity","data protection","financial data processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain","integrity protected data storage","technological innovation","financial value"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","Distributed Ledger","Permissionless","Permissioned"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525392","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8525353/8525381/08525392.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00011","doi":"10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525381","publicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Do you Need a Blockchain?","abstract":"Blockchain is being praised as a technological innovation which allows to revolutionize how society trades and interacts.

In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database.

One of the typical scams that operate on Bitcoin are the so-called Ponzi schemes. These are fraudulent investments which repay users with the funds invested by new users that join the scheme, and implode when it is no longer possible to find new investments. Despite being illegal in many countries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep alluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data mining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our starting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we construct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to perform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine learning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard validation protocols and performance metrics. The best of the classifiers we have experimented can identify most of the Ponzi schemes in the dataset, with a low number of false positives.","doi":"10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00014","publicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8525353/8525381/08525395.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Mining for Detecting Bitcoin Ponzi Schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Data Mining for Detecting Bitcoin Ponzi Schemes","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525395/","accessionNumber":"18232820","publicationDate":"Jun 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Mining for Detecting Bitcoin Ponzi Schemes","confLoc":"Zug, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"720401a075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119938S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8525353","isNumber":"8525381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8525353","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8525381","articleId":"8525395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525396,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Ga\u017ei","affiliation":["IORK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Ga\u017ei","id":"37086522915"},{"name":"Aggelos Kiayias","affiliation":["University of Edinburgh & IOHK"],"firstName":"Aggelos","lastName":"Kiayias","id":"37545427800"},{"name":"Alexander Russell","affiliation":["University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Russell","id":"37361975800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7204-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7205-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525396","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":898},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Checkpointing","History","Bitcoin","Stakeholders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","electronic money","transaction processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain protocols","PoS protocols","stake-bleeding attacks","proof-of-stake blockchains","transaction fees","cryptocurrencies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blockchain","proof of stake","attack"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525396","abstract":"We describe a general attack on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains without checkpointing.

The attack grows in power with the number of honest transactions and the stake held by the adversary, and can be launched by an adversary controlling any constant fraction of the stake. With the present statistical profile of blockchain protocols, the attack can be launched given a few years of prior blockchain operation; hence it is within the realm of feasibility for PoS protocols. Most importantly, it demonstrates how closely transaction fees and rewards are coupled with the security properties of PoS protocols. More broadly, our attack must be reflected and countered in any future PoS design that avoids checkpointing, as well as any effort to remove checkpointing from existing protocols. We describe several mechanisms for protecting against the attack that include context-sensitivity of transactions and chain density statistics.","doi":"10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00015","publicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8525353/8525381/08525396.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stake-Bleeding Attacks on Proof-of-Stake Blockchains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stake-Bleeding Attacks on Proof-of-Stake Blockchains","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18232824","publicationDate":"Jun 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525396/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525396/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2018","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stake-Bleeding Attacks on Proof-of-Stake Blockchains","confLoc":"Zug, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"720401a085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054832S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8525353","isNumber":"8525381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8525353","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8525381","articleId":"8525396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525398,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Hinckeldeyn","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Hamburg, Hamburg, Hamburg, DE"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Hinckeldeyn"},{"name":"Kreutzfeldt Jochen","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Hamburg, Hamburg, Hamburg, DE"],"firstName":"Kreutzfeldt","lastName":"Jochen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7204-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7205-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525398","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525398","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Supply chains","Prototypes","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["containers","contracts","Internet of Things","logistics","production engineering computing","supply chain management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart storage container","Blockchain-based supply chain application","Ethereum-based smart contract","Internet of Things","arbitrate disagreements","multi signature wallet","payment process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain, Ethereum, logistics, smart storage containers, material supply, supply chain, Internet of Things"]}],"abstract":"Blockchain and Internet of Things are supposed to have big impact on logistics.

Due to these properties, the Bitcoin protocol is being used as a decentralized, trusted, and secure timestamping service. Although Bitcoin participants which create new blocks cannot modify their order, they can manipulate timestamps almost undetected. This undermines the Bitcoin protocol as a reliable timestamping service. In particular, a newcomer that synchronizes the entire blockchain has a little guarantee about timestamps of all blocks. In this paper, we present a simple yet powerful mechanism that increases the reliability of Bitcoin timestamps. Our protocol can provide evidence that a block was created within a certain time range. The protocol is efficient, backward compatible, and surprisingly, currently deployed SSL/TLS servers can act as reference time sources. The protocol has many applications and can be used for detecting various attacks against the Bitcoin protocol.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Bitcoin","Reliability","Synchronization","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptographic protocols","digital signatures","electronic money","protocols","public key cryptography","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure timestamping service","Bitcoin participants","Bitcoin protocol","freshness properties","timestamping service","bitcoin timestamps","SSL/TLS servers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bitcoin","timestamping","freshness","blockchain"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00018","publicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8525353/8525381/08525399.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"(Short Paper) Towards More Reliable Bitcoin Timestamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"(Short Paper) Towards More Reliable Bitcoin Timestamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525399/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525399/","accessionNumber":"18232825","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"(Short Paper) Towards More Reliable Bitcoin Timestamps","confLoc":"Zug, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"720401a101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055214S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8525353","isNumber":"8525381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8525353","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8525381","articleId":"8525399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8525421,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Wei","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Advanced Communications and Data Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8605558/8525421/wei-2878571-small.gif","p":["Fan Wei received the B.S. degree from the Xi\u2019an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, in 2014.

To address those problems, a grant-free receiver design is considered in this paper based on sparse code multiple access (SCMA), one of the promising air interface technologies for 5G wireless networks. With the presence of unknown multipath fading, the proposed receiver performs joint channel estimation and data decoding without knowing the user activity in the network. Formulating a factor graph representation for the problem, we devise a message-passing receiver for the uplink SCMA that performs joint estimation iteratively. Motivated by the idea of approximate inference, we use expectation propagation to project the intractable distributions into Gaussian families such that a linear complexity decoder is obtained. The simulation results show that the proposed receiver can detect active devices in the network with a high accuracy and can achieve an improved bit-error-rate performance compared with existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"18","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18400975","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8525421/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Message-Passing Receiver Design for Joint Channel Estimation and Data Decoding in Uplink Grant-Free SCMA Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF, China","grantNumber":"61671294 and 61701301"},{"fundingName":"National Major Project","grantNumber":"2017ZX03001002-005 and 2018ZX03001009-002"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Kewei","grantNumber":"616JC1402900 and 17510740700"},{"fundingName":"NSF Guangxi","grantNumber":"2015GXNSFDA139003"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Key Laboratory of Automatic Detecting Technology and Instruments","grantNumber":"YQ14115"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message-Passing Receiver Design for Joint Channel Estimation and Data Decoding in Uplink Grant-Free SCMA Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-chen-2878571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132818S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8525421","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525422,"authors":[{"name":"Ruihan Hu","affiliation":["School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8738884/8525422/hu-2875471-small.gif","p":["Ruihan Hu was born in Wuhan, China, in 1992.

Due to the discontinuous nature of the internal state of spiking neuron, it is challenging to ensure that the number of output spikes and target spikes kept identical in multispike learning. This problem is conventionally dealt with by using the smaller of the number of desired spikes and that of actual output spikes in learning. However, if this approach is used, information is lost as some spikes are neglected. In this paper, a probability-modulated timing mechanism is built on the stochastic neurons, where the discontinuous spike patterns are converted to the likelihood of generating the desired output spike trains. By applying this mechanism to a probability-modulated spiking classifier, a probability-modulated SNN (PMSNN) is constructed. In its multilayer and multispike learning structure, more inputs are incorporated and mapped to the target spike trains. A clustering rule connection mechanism is also applied to a reservoir to improve the efficiency of information transmission among synapses, which can map the highly correlated inputs to the adjacent neurons. Results of comparisons between the proposed method and popular the SNN algorithms showed that the PMSNN yields higher efficiency and requires fewer parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2875471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8738884/08525422.pdf","startPage":"1984","endPage":"1997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2875471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525422/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Multispike Learning for Spiking Neural Networks Using Probability-Modulated Timing Method","volume":"30","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"18757950","pubMedId":"30418889","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8525422/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61574102 and 61404094"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007046","fundingName":"Wuhan University","grantNumber":"2042015kf0174 and 2042016kf0189"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2012T50688"},{"fundingName":"Hubei Province Science and Technology Pillar Program","grantNumber":"2015CFB536"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Multispike Learning for Spiking Neural Networks Using Probability-Modulated Timing Method","sourcePdf":"tnnls-chang-2875471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112651S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8738884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8738884","articleId":"8525422","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8525430,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Makki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8605558/8525430/makki-2878713-small.gif","p":["Behrooz Makki received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in bioelectric engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, and the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Particularly, we propose a fast HARQ protocol where, to increase the end-to-end throughput, some HARQ feedback signals and successive message decodings are omitted. Considering quasi-static channels and a bursty communication model, we derive closed-form expressions for the message decoding probabilities as well as the throughput, the expected delay, and the error probability of the HARQ setups. The analysis is based on the recent results on the achievable rates of finite-length codes and shows the effect of the codeword length on the system performance. Moreover, we evaluate the effect of various parameters, such as imperfect channel estimation and hardware on the system performance. As demonstrated, the proposed fast HARQ protocol reduces the packet transmission delay considerably compared with the state-of-the-art HARQ schemes. For example, with typical message decoding delay profiles and a maximum of 2,..., 5 transmission rounds, the proposed fast HARQ protocol can improve the expected delay compared with standard HARQ by 27%, 42%, 52% and 60%, respectively, independently of the code rate/fading model.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2878713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2878713","startPage":"194","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8605558/08525430.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast HARQ Over Finite Blocklength Codes: A Technique for Low-Latency Reliable Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Fast HARQ Over Finite Blocklength Codes: A Technique for Low-Latency Reliable Communication","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18400970","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8525430/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"671650"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) through the VINN Excellence Center Chase"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast HARQ Over Finite Blocklength Codes: A Technique for Low-Latency Reliable Communication","sourcePdf":"twc-makki-2878713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152117S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8525430","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525433,"authors":[{"name":"Fanghai Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9321228/8525433/zhang-2876003-small.gif","p":["Fanghai Zhang received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Fuyang Normal College, Fuyang, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2018.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher in control science and engineering with the School of Automation and School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

The recently introduced Spark platform is a new processing method for big data analysis and related learning systems, which has attracted increasing attention from both the scientific community and industry. In this paper, we propose a shared nearest-neighbor quantum game-based attribute reduction (SNNQGAR) algorithm that incorporates the hierarchical coevolutionary Spark model. We first present a shared coevolutionary nearest-neighbor hierarchy with self-evolving compensation that considers the features of nearest-neighborhood attribute subsets and calculates the similarity between attribute subsets according to the shared neighbor information of attribute sample points. We then present a novel attribute weight tensor model to generate ranking vectors of attributes and apply them to balance the relative contributions of different neighborhood attribute subsets. To optimize the model, we propose an embedded quantum equilibrium game paradigm (QEGP) to ensure that noisy attributes do not degrade the big data reduction results. A combination of the hierarchical coevolutionary Spark model and an improved MapReduce framework is then constructed that it can better parallelize the SNNQGAR to efficiently determine the preferred reduction solutions of the distributed attribute subsets. The experimental comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of the SNNQGAR, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art attribute reduction algorithms. Moreover, the results indicate that the SNNQGAR can be successfully applied to segment overlapping and interdependent fuzzy cerebral tissues, and it exhibits a stable and consistent segmentation performance for neonatal cerebral cortical surfaces.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning

Despite its significant progress in recent years, there are still two challenging issues in the current ensemble clustering research. First, most of the existing algorithms tend to investigate the ensemble information at the object-level, yet often lack the ability to explore the rich information at higher levels of granularity. Second, they mostly focus on the direct connections (e.g., direct intersection or pair-wise co-occurrence) in the multiple base clusterings, but generally neglect the multiscale indirect relationship hidden in them. To address these two issues, this paper presents a novel ensemble clustering approach based on fast propagation of cluster-wise similarities via random walks. We first construct a cluster similarity graph with the base clusters treated as graph nodes and the cluster-wise Jaccard coefficient exploited to compute the initial edge weights. Upon the constructed graph, a transition probability matrix is defined, based on which the random walk process is conducted to propagate the graph structural information. Specifically, by investigating the propagating trajectories starting from different nodes, a new cluster-wise similarity matrix can be derived by considering the trajectory relationship. Then, the newly obtained cluster-wise similarity matrix is mapped from the cluster-level to the object-level to achieve an enhanced co-association matrix, which is able to simultaneously capture the object-wise co-occurrence relationship as well as the multiscale cluster-wise relationship in ensembles. Finally, two novel consensus functions are proposed to obtain the consensus clustering result. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2876202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/9321228/08525437.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2018.2876202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9321228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Ensemble Clustering via Fast Propagation of Cluster-Wise Similarities","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.7592547.v1","uri":"https://codeocean.com/capsule/0974003/tree/v1","name":"MATLAB Source Code for: Enhanced Ensemble Clustering via Fast Propagation of Cluster-Wise Similarities (IEEE TSMC-S)","language":"MATLAB","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?slug=0974003&v=1","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Ensemble Clustering via Fast Propagation of Cluster-Wise Similarities","volume":"51","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2021","accessionNumber":"20287037","htmlLink":"/document/8525437/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61602189, 61502543, 61573387 and 61876193"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1001003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A030310457 and 2016A030306014"},{"fundingName":"Singapore Ministry of Education Tier-1 Grant","grantNumber":"RG21/15"},{"fundingName":"Singapore Ministry of Education Tier-2 Grant","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-023"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Ensemble Clustering via Fast Propagation of Cluster-Wise Similarities","sourcePdf":"tsmc-huang-2876202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182916S","chronDate":"Jan.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9321228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"9321228","articleId":"8525437","onlineDate":"06 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8525440,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8605558/8525440/liu-2878720-small.gif","p":["Lei Liu received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from Xidian University in 2017.

The GMP for MIMO-NOMA is a message passing algorithm operating on a fully-connected loopy factor graph, which is well understood to fail to converge due to the correlation problem. The GMP is attractive as its complexity order is only linearly dependent on the number of users, compared to the cubic complexity order of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) MUD. In this paper, we utilize the large-scale property of the system to simplify the convergence analysis of the GMP under the overloaded condition. We prove that the variances of the GMP definitely converge to the mean square error (MSE) of the LMMSE multi-user detection.

However, these loss functions are not very robust when categories are imbalanced or many easy examples dominate training losses. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose angular focus softmax (AF-Softmax) loss by introducing a focusing factor to lessen the losses attached to those well-classified examples.

We mask words according to their polarity scores and force the model to pay more attention to inapparent features. The model is supposed to extract not only the features with strong polarity but also the features with weak polarity, which is helpful for the classification.

This technology requires the interaction between the user and the device through a control interface that detects the user's movement intention. Basing on the Motor-Imagery theory, many researchers have explored a wide variety of Classifiers to identify patients' physiological signals from many different sources in order to detect patients' moves intentions. We here propose a novel approach relying on the use of a Weightless Neural Network-based classifier, whose design lends itself to an easy hardware implementation. Additionally, we employ a non-invasive light weight and easy donning EEG-helmet in order to provide a portable controller interface. The developed interface is connected to a robotic hand for controlling open/close actions. We compared the proposed classifier with state of the art classifiers by showing that the proposed method achieves similar performance and contemporaneously represents a viable and practicable solution due to its portability on hardware devices, which will permit its direct implementation on the helmet board.","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525521","startPage":"487","endPage":"490","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509495/8525500/08525521.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Weightless Neural Network as a Classifier to Translate EEG Signals into Robotic hand Commands","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Discrete wavelet transforms","Retina","Computer architecture","Robot sensing systems","Electroencephalography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","diseases","electroencephalography","helmet mounted displays","manipulators","medical robotics","medical signal processing","neural nets","signal classification","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portable controller interface","robotic hand commands","automatic movement-prothesis control","diseases","temporary paralysis","permanent paralysis","control interface","Motor-Imagery theory","weightless neural network","EEG signal translation","EEG-helmet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Weightless Neural Network as a Classifier to Translate EEG Signals into Robotic hand Commands","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8525521/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232496","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Weightless Neural Network as a Classifier to Translate EEG Signals into Robotic hand Commands","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"TuBT3-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057739S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509495","isNumber":"8525500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509495","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8525500","articleId":"8525521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8525556,"authors":[{"name":"Mingli Yu","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Lab, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingli","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086512122"},{"name":"Chuang Zhang","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Lab, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37592714100"},{"name":"Ming Wu","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Lab, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37595758900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6067-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6066-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6068-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"8525556","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Optical flow","Real-time systems","Optical buffering","Convolutional neural networks","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image motion analysis","image segmentation","video signal processing","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video image","real-time video action classification","three-dimensional convolutional neural network","real-time video streaming","spatio-temporal information","motionless segments","action classification task","low delay constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time video","Three-dimensional convolutional neural network","Optical flow"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525556","abstract":"This paper describes a model for performing action classification in real-time video streaming.

The objective is maximizing the overall performance which is evaluated by Packets Receive Ratio (PRR). To solve this NP-problem, a centralized resource allocation mechanism is proposed. The resource allocation algorithm divides vehicles into several groups according to their motion statuses. Then vehicles in the same group share the same Resource Block (RB) with NOMA manner to transmit packets while receivers apply Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to decode packets. Resource reallocation only happens to vehicle that changes its moving status.

Handing over objects for instance rely almost exclusively on such a capability: robots should be able to detect the object of interest, localize and track its movements in order to synchronize temporally and spatially the transition phase. In the past few years, a variety of architectures based on convolutional neural networks, especially that of the R-CNN and YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, largely contribute to the improvement of detection accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we design a visual detection system to detect some objects the Nao robot should detect and track based on the YOLO architecture. We adopt the tiny YOLO network as a pretrained model and modify the last fully connected layer for three-class object detection. The model is trained on 4322 training images and achieves the mean average precision (mAP) of 44.3% on our test set. This model is then applied to a well-known function of the Nao vision system: detecting and localizing landmarks. It is also applied to daily objects. The results demonstrate that it could help localizing and tracking accurately objects of interest in HRI (human-robot interaction).","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525582","startPage":"479","endPage":"482","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication

Our goal is to improve the performance of the sound event detection using a pre-processing module called parameterized multi-channel non-causal Wiener filter (PMWF). First, we convert the existing 1 channel data to 2 channels through the Room impulse response generator (RIR) module. The reason for 2-channel conversion is that PMWF requires multiple channels for beamforming. Noise cancellation is performed through PMWF and the results are derived through the proposed convolutional neural network model. As a result, we found that this method has a good effect on real-time sound event detection, and we found that peak normalization and median filter also have a good effect.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18248913","htmlLink":"/document/8525597/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sound Event Detection Based on Beamformed Convolutional Neural Network Using Multi-Microphones","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sound Event Detection Based on Beamformed Convolutional Neural Network Using Multi-Microphones","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"035-037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057314S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8511804","isNumber":"8525504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8511804","xplore-issue":"8525504","articleId":"8525597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525602,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086509551"},{"name":"Xiaoqi Li","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086513056"},{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405131300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6067-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6066-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6068-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"8525602","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":271},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525602","abstract":"Recent research about remote heart rate (pulse) estimation through facial videos has aimed to improve the measurement accuracy under noisy interference by improving the preprocessing method to get more robust time domain feature representation.

The current methods of getting license plate based on deep learning are increasingly various, however, there are still many images where illumination, size and blurriness make it is extremely difficult to recognize. As a result, images with low quality eventually affect the accuracy of recognition.

Furthermore, by following the channel cross-over probability of binary symmetric channel (BSC), the probability that a received codewords is the valid codewords of a BCH code is calculated and used in proposed algorithm. Through the hypothesis test which use the number of valid codewords, the BCH code used at the transmitter is distinguished at the receiver and then the generator polynomial can be reconstructed. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm has much better recognition performance than the previous method.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525647","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8511804/8525504/08525647.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Approach for Blind Recognition of Narrow-sense BCH Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Approach for Blind Recognition of Narrow-sense BCH Codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18248927","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525647/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525647/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Approach for Blind Recognition of Narrow-sense BCH Codes","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"074-057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064721S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8511804","isNumber":"8525504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8511804","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8525504","articleId":"8525647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8525652,"authors":[{"name":"Jesin James","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, NZ"],"firstName":"Jesin","lastName":"James","id":"37086509456"},{"name":"Catherine Inez Watson","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, NZ"],"firstName":"Catherine Inez","lastName":"Watson","id":"37587998100"},{"name":"Bruce MacDonald","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, NZ"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"MacDonald","id":"37300950400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7980-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7979-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7981-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1944-9445"}],"articleNumber":"8525652","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":627},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Empathy in Social Robots: An analysis of Emotions in Speech","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509495/8525500/08525652.pdf","startPage":"632","endPage":"637","publicationTitle":"2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525500","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525652","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Standards","Robot sensing systems","Medical services","Anthropomorphism","Human-robot interaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","emotion recognition","human-robot interaction","robots","service robots","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot speech","appropriate emotions","humans","robot interacting","empathetic speech","standard robotic voice","human users","social robots","artificial empathy","artificial speech","speech synthesizers","Human Robot Interaction","empathetically interacting robot","human perception experiment","human subjects"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525652","abstract":"Artificial speech developed using speech synthesizers has been used as the voice for robots in Human Robot Interaction (HRI). As humans anthropomorphize robots, an empathetically interacting robot is expected to increase the level of acceptance of social robots. Here, a human perception experiment evaluates whether human subjects perceive empathy in robot speech. For this experiment, empathy is expressed only by adding appropriate emotions to the words in speech. Also, humans' preferences for a robot interacting with empathetic speech versus a standard robotic voice are also assessed. The results show that humans are able to perceive empathy and emotions in robot speech, and prefer it over the standard robotic voice. It is important for the emotions in empathetic speech to be consistent with the language content of what is being said, and with the human users' emotional state. Analyzing emotions in empathetic speech using valence-arousal model has revealed the importance of secondary emotions in developing empathetically speaking social robots.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232632","htmlLink":"/document/8525652/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Empathy in Social Robots: An analysis of Emotions in Speech","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Empathy in Social Robots: An analysis of Emotions in Speech","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"TuDP-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068113S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509495","isNumber":"8525500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509495","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8525500","articleId":"8525652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525658,"authors":[{"name":"Valeria Villani","affiliation":["Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), University of Modena and Reggio, Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Villani","id":"38228363100"},{"name":"Lorenzo Sabattini","affiliation":["Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), University of Modena and Reggio, Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Sabattini","id":"37594737400"},{"name":"Cristian Secchi","affiliation":["Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), University of Modena and Reggio, Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Secchi","id":"37300905500"},{"name":"Cesare Fantuzzi","affiliation":["Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), University of Modena and Reggio, Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Cesare","lastName":"Fantuzzi","id":"37300904700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7980-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7979-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7981-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1944-9445"}],"articleNumber":"8525658","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525658","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Fatigue","Mobile robots","Stress","Heart rate variability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","human-robot interaction","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affect-based natural human-robot interaction","affective human-robot interaction","mental fatigue","forearm motion","affective robotics","wheeled mobile robot","robot autonomy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a general framework for affective human-robot interaction that allows users to intuitively interact with a robot and takes into account their mental fatigue, thus simplifying the task or providing assistance when the user feels stressed.

An approach based on affective robotics is used to adapt the level of robot's autonomy to the cognitive workload of the user. User's mental fatigue is detected from the analysis of heart rate, also measured by the smartwatch. The framework is general and can be applied to different robotic systems.

One of the key issues in improving the performance of SER systems is the choice of speech emotion features. In order to establish a robust speech emotion recognition system, it is essential to select the features which can be a perfect representation of speech emotion attributes. Researchers has done a lot of work, proposed a variety of emotional features and made great progress. Although each kind of features were proven to be effective, most of methods are based on a single type. In this paper, we proposed a method of feature fusion based on deep learning, combining spectral-based features and pitch-based hyper-prosodic features. The experiments show that this method improves the performance of speech emotion recognition system.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525706","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8511804/8525504/08525706.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Fusion of Speech Emotion Recognition Based on Deep Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525706/","displayDocTitle":"Feature Fusion of Speech Emotion Recognition Based on Deep Learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18248925","htmlLink":"/document/8525706/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Fusion of Speech Emotion Recognition Based on Deep Learning","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"040-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061794S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8511804","isNumber":"8525504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8511804","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8525504","articleId":"8525706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525714,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Shi","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086509979"},{"name":"Gang He","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"He","id":"37086511672"},{"name":"Xinwen Liu","affiliation":["Beijing WiseTone Technologies Co., Ltd, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinwen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086511790"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6067-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6066-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6068-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"8525714","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":688},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Anomaly detection","Predictive models","Data models","Boosting","Regression tree analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","regression analysis","time series","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["key performance indicators","data center","Web service","statistical machine learning","time series analysis method","regression-based machine","anomaly detection rule","gradient boosting regression trees","triple order exponential smoothing","Holt-Winters model","ARIMA model","long short-term memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Time Series","Holt-Winters","ARIMA","Gradient Boosting Regression Trees","Long short-term Memory","LSTM","Machine Learning"]}],"abstract":"The data center and servers generates a large amount of monitoring data and logs every day.

However, the recognition and generation of signed sentences is a complex task of high dimensionality that cannot be solved in sufficient quality yet. Thus, it is necessary to develop new technologies of improved performances. The sequence to sequence neural network model, traditionally used for machine translation, is adapted to the above two tasks by treating a SL sequence as a multi-dimensional sentence. We defined an encoding of the SL annotations and conducted experiments on the network structure to define a most accurate translation model. This study proves the network trainable and possibly applicable in real-life with an extended dataset, which shall be tested for deployment in virtual translation assistants in the following.","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525717","startPage":"370","endPage":"377","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509495/8525500/08525717.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven development of Virtual Sign Language Communication Agents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven development of Virtual Sign Language Communication Agents","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8525717/","accessionNumber":"18232637","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525717/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven development of Virtual Sign Language Communication Agents","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"TuAT3-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119521S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509495","isNumber":"8525500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509495","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8525500","articleId":"8525717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8525721,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzhi Huang","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligence System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086510999"},{"name":"Gang Liu","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Intelligence System Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600972900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6067-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6066-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6068-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"8525721","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525721","abstract":"The main task of the melody extraction is to extract the fundamental frequency contour of the vocal music in the polyphonic music in which the vocal music and the background music are mixed. There are many applications in the music information retrieval. In the paper of Fujishima, Hermes et al, the theory of subharmonic sum (SHS) was applied to extract the fundamental frequency[1] [2]. Sangeun Kum et al. applied neural networks to extract melody and obtain a state-of-the-art result[3] [4]. In this paper, the theory of harmonic structure and neural network are combined together, and a new network DHNN (Deep Harmonic Neural Network) is proposed, which is applied in the melody extraction. Compared with the method without neural network, the new network DHNN introduces the supervised learning and Sequence-to-sequence relationship. Compared with the neural network method of Sangeun Kum, the harmonic structure is introduced, making the new network, DHNN more suitable for melody extraction. This paper fulfill two kinds of the new network, RNN-DHNN and CNN-DHNN, the results we have obtained in the experiments are closed to, even beyond the state-of-the-art on MIREX1k and mirex05 datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525721","startPage":"174","endPage":"178","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8511804/8525504/08525721.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Melody Extraction Based on Deep Harmonic Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Neural networks","Spectrogram","Feature extraction","Network architecture","Hidden Markov models","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","information retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","music","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["melody extraction","fundamental frequency contour","vocal music","polyphonic music","background music","music information retrieval","network DHNN","deep harmonic neural network","subharmonic sum","SHS","sequence-to-sequence relationship","RNN-DHNN","CNN-DHNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Melody extraction","DHNN","RNN-DHNN","CNN-DHNN","Harmonic structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Melody Extraction Based on Deep Harmonic Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8525721/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232792","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Melody Extraction Based on Deep Harmonic Neural Network","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"036-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151866S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8511804","isNumber":"8525504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8511804","xplore-issue":"8525504","articleId":"8525721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8525737,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Han","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Han","id":"37085763608"},{"name":"Sheng Gao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37596428600"},{"name":"Jin Li","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086510571"},{"name":"Xinming Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086512850"},{"name":"Jun Guo","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085616442"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6067-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6066-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6068-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"8525737","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectrogram","Sensors","Recurrent neural networks","Microwave sensors","Monitoring","Data models","Anomaly detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["age issues","convolution","data analysis","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","patient diagnosis","pattern classification","recurrent neural nets","sensor fusion","signal classification","spectrometers","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","health data","abnormal human status","noncontact sensors","deep learning algorithms","convolutional neural network","activities classification","support vector machine","recurrent neural network","spectrogram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Anomaly Detection","Health Monitoring","Convolutional Neural Network","Recurrent Neural Network"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection in health data means finding out abnormal human status automatically.

This scheme includes two approaches, approach based on raw data which aims at abnormal activities and approach based on spectrogram which aims at abnormal status. Convolutional neural network is used to classify activities that predicted by support vector machine later, and recurrent neural network is used to predict signals directly.

However, the buildings and artificial facilities in the port area will cause false alarms in the vessel recognition results, which decrease the accuracy. Therefore, containing the object detection and semantic segmentation tasks of deep convolutional neural networks, this paper proposes a ship identification method based on scene-mask R-CNN. Based on the deep convolutional neural network, location information extraction, target classification and target scene discrimination are organically combined to a unified object detection framework. It works in the scene that contains the object, and the context information is used to suppress false alarms that appear in the non-target scene area.

Most of the industrial data are time series with multiple features collected from different sensors and a good feature presentation is very important for accurate results. In order to extract features automatically and get accurate results, we propose an end-to-end method, CNN-LSTM, for industrial data based on deep learning and transfer learning, where CNN extracts features automatically and LSTM analyzes the new feature sequences from CNN.

A robot usually listens to target acoustic signals such as speech and music in noisy conditions. Acoustic information on such signals inevitably contaminated with noise. Even when noise reduction techniques such as sound source separation are performed, the noise-reduced acoustic signals contain distortion and/or residual noise after the noise reduction to some extent. The distortion and residual noise basically degrade the performance of recognition processes such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). We decided to use bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) for acoustic signal restoration since it can represent dynamic behaviors well for a temporal sequence in the forward and backward directions. When applying Bi-LSTM to recover acoustic signals, there is an issue, that is, acoustic signals tend to be sparse in high frequencies, and thus Bi-LSTM training becomes insufficient in such high frequencies due to a lack of training data. Therefore, we propose a new restoration method based on Bi-LSTM with spectral filtering. The spectral filter and the corresponding inverse filter are introduced to a Bi-LSTM framework to accelerate training in high frequencies. Preliminary results showed that the proposed Bi-LSTM with spectral filtering can perform signal restoration even when a small amount of training data is available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232501","htmlLink":"/document/8525793/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Signal Restoration based on Bi-directional LSTM with Spectral Filtering for Robot Audition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Restoration based on Bi-directional LSTM with Spectral Filtering for Robot Audition","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"WeCT1-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092421S","chronDate":"27-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509495","isNumber":"8525500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509495","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8525500","articleId":"8525793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8525802,"authors":[{"name":"Taras Maksymyuk","affiliation":["Lviv Polytechnic National University, Lviv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Taras","lastName":"Maksymyuk","id":"37547517100"},{"name":"Juraj Gazda","affiliation":["Technical University of Ko\u0161ice, Kosice, Slovakia"],"firstName":"Juraj","lastName":"Gazda","id":"37391894100"},{"name":"Oleh Yaremko","affiliation":["Lviv Polytechnic National University, Lviv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Oleh","lastName":"Yaremko","id":"37086512326"},{"name":"Denys Nevinskiy","affiliation":["Lviv Polytechnic National University, Lviv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Denys","lastName":"Nevinskiy","id":"37086509448"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7587-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-9339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7586-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7588-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525802","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2738},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Array signal processing","Antenna arrays","5G mobile communication","Throughput","Spectral efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","array signal processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","MIMO communication","neural nets","next generation networks","optimisation","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic user mobility patterns","neural network","massive MIMO beamforming","5G mobile network","mobile networks forces operators","network design","deep adversarial reinforcement learning workflow","intelligent algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","massive MIMO","5G","beamforming","AI"]}],"abstract":"The rapid increasing of the data volume in mobile networks forces operators to look into different options for capacity improvement. Thus, modern 5G networks became more complex in terms of deployment and management. Therefore, new approaches are needed to simplify network design and management by enabling self-organizing capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent algorithm for performance optimization of the massive MIMO beamforming. The key novelty of the proposed algorithm is in the combination of three neural networks which cooperatively implement the deep adversarial reinforcement learning workflow. In the proposed system, one neural network is trained to generate realistic user mobility patterns, which are then used by second neural network to produce relevant antenna diagram. Meanwhile, third neural network estimates the efficiency of the generated antenna diagram returns corresponding reward to both networks. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it leans by itself and does not require large training datasets.","doi":"10.1109/IDAACS-SWS.2018.8525802","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 4th International Symposium on Wireless Systems within the International Conferences on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems (IDAACS-SWS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 4th International Symposium on Wireless Systems within the International Conferences on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems (IDAACS-SWS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8507706/8525498/08525802.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDAACS-SWS.2018.8525802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525498","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Massive MIMO Beamforming for 5G Mobile Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Massive MIMO Beamforming for 5G Mobile Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525802/","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18248816","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525802/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Massive MIMO Beamforming for 5G Mobile Network","confLoc":"Lviv, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"241-244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8507706","isNumber":"8525498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8507706","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8525498","articleId":"8525802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525808,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086510893"},{"name":"Yihong Hu","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yihong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085846296"},{"name":"Hongxing Li","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongxing","lastName":"Li","id":"37085769753"},{"name":"Guochu Shou","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guochu","lastName":"Shou","id":"37396578900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6067-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6066-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6068-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"8525808","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"abstract":"In Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, edge computing, one emerging paradigm, becomes a feasible supplementary solution under the cloud architecture by increasing computing and storage resources available at the network edge.

To solve the issue, we propose a lightweight edge computing platform relying on the emerging lightweight virtualization and the Edge Intelligent Server(EIS) which integrates computing and networking capabilities. In addition, we design a scheme of video services based on the platform and provide performance evaluations.

Few researches on employing deep learning for network traffic control and wireless resource management have emerged as a new research direction in the communication networking area. However, how to deploy the deep learning structure in a universal way to suit for common network applications and how to format the training data still remain as a formidable research challenge. Furthermore, whether and why the deep learning structure is efficient in contrast with that of the shallow learning model, from the perspective of networking applications, has not been investigated well in the literature. In this paper, we address these issues, and propose a matrix and tensor based spatial-temporal training data format. Our proposal can be regarded as a universal characterization of network traffic patterns. Furthermore, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure is constructed to fit the proposed training data format of the corresponding tensor space. The performance of our envisioned tensor based deep learning model is further analyzed by comparing with the shallow learning model. Computer based simulation results demonstrate that our proposal achieves significant improvement in terms of both training accuracy and network performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525850","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8511804/8525504/08525850.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"451","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Extracting the Spatial-Temporal Features of Network Traffic Patterns: A Tensor Based Deep Learning Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"On Extracting the Spatial-Temporal Features of Network Traffic Patterns: A Tensor Based Deep Learning Model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525850/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232760","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525850/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Extracting the Spatial-Temporal Features of Network Traffic Patterns: A Tensor Based Deep Learning Model","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"090-020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091942S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8511804","isNumber":"8525504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8511804","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8525504","articleId":"8525850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8525852,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ran","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ran","id":"37086019303"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37291355100"},{"name":"Hongyan Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086512544"},{"name":"Hongxin Song","affiliation":["Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongxin","lastName":"Song","id":"37086510058"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6067-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6066-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6068-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-4955"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2374-0272"}],"articleNumber":"8525852","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cataracts","Feature extraction","Radio frequency","Blindness","Artificial intelligence","Diseases","Surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","convolution","diseases","eye","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","medical image processing","patient treatment","random processes","vision defects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cataract detection","cataract blindness","fundus images","artificial intelligence algorithms","DCNN","deep convolutional neural network","random forests","eye diseases","cataract grading","visual impairment","diagnose cataracts","treatment","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cataract","Six-level grading","Random Forests","Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Combination"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525852","abstract":"Cataract is one of the most common eye diseases which leads to visual impairment and is the main cause of blindness. Early intervention and timely treatment can largely avoid cataract blindness. Cataract grading based on fundus images by artificial intelligence algorithms is a feasible method to assistant doctors to diagnose cataracts more effectively. In this paper, a method that Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) combined with Random Forests (RF) is proposed for six-level cataract grading. In this method, DCNN consists of three modules for feature extraction at different levels on fundus images, while RF implements more elaborate six-level cataract grading based on the feature datasets generated by DCNN. The six-level grading allows doctors to understand the patient's condition more accurately than four-level grading. The accuracy of six-level grading achieved by the proposed method is up to 90.69% on average, with superiority in specificity and sensitivity indicators. Our experimental results also show that RF improves the grading accuracy and reduces the concussion of DCNN on small datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525852","pdfPath":"/iel7/8511804/8525504/08525852.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"159","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cataract Detection and Grading Based on Combination of Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forests","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Cataract Detection and Grading Based on Combination of Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forests","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18232758","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525852/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cataract Detection and Grading Based on Combination of Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forests","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"032-085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074159S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8511804","isNumber":"8525504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8511804","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8525504","articleId":"8525852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8525868,"authors":[{"name":"Yejia Di","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University"],"firstName":"Yejia","lastName":"Di","id":"37085661911"},{"name":"Liang Shi","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Shi","id":"38019681300"},{"name":"Congming Gao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University"],"firstName":"Congming","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085533896"},{"name":"Qiao Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086498690"},{"name":"Chun Jason Xue","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chun Jason","lastName":"Xue","id":"37265504000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5563-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525868","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525868","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","flash memories","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wear leveling mechanism","lifetime improvement","wear leveling design","compression applied 3D NAND flash memory","data compression ratios","flash pages","state-of-the-art wear leveling schemes","three-dimensional NAND flash memory","memory cells","proportional wearing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D flash memory","compression","wear leveling"]}],"abstract":"Compression has been demonstrated as an efficient method for lifetime improvement on flash memory.

Thus, there will be some waste on lifetime exploitation, especially for three-dimensional (3D) NAND flash memory. 3D NAND flash memory is developed to boost the storage capacity by stacking memory cells vertically.

Despite the merits of video-based lectures, new challenges can paralyze the learning process. Challenges that deal with video content accessibility, such as searching, retrieving, explaining, matching, organizing, and even summarizing these contents, significantly limit the potential of video-based learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to segment video lectures and integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks to extract key linguistic features exist within the video. We exploit the benefits of visual, audio, and textual features in order to create comprehensive temporal feature vectors for the enhanced segmented video. Afterwards, we apply an NLP cosine similarity to the cluster and identify the various topics presented in the video. The final product would be an indexed, vector-based searchable video segments of a specific topic/subtopic.","doi":"10.1109/ICMCS.2018.8525880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCS.2018.8525880","publicationTitle":"2018 6th International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems (ICMCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 6th International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems (ICMCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488380/8525492/08525880.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"NLP-Enriched Automatic Video Segmentation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2018","accessionNumber":"18220037","htmlLink":"/document/8525880/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NLP-Enriched Automatic Video Segmentation","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICMCS18_paper_96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049533S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488380","isNumber":"8525492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488380","xplore-issue":"8525492","articleId":"8525880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525906,"authors":[{"name":"Hongfei Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hongfei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086510036"},{"name":"Jianwen Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Li","id":"37086510552"},{"name":"Kun He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"He","id":"37085733422"},{"name":"Wenjie Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Cai","id":"37086512553"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5563-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525906","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Vegetation","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Forestry","Minimization","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","electronic engineering computing","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","learning (artificial intelligence)","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wearable devices","embedded systems","computational parallelism","hierarchical ensemble learning","resource-aware FPGA computing","machine learning models","hardware systems","decision trees","single tree model","Random Forest","tree ensembles","hardware codesign","neuromorphic computing systems","software codesign"]}],"abstract":"Recent years witness the rapid development in hardware/software codesign that integrates machine learning (ML) models with hardware systems [1]-[4]. Despite the booming trend in building neuromorphic computing systems [2], decision trees still attract much attention in ML communities, from both software [5], [6] and hardware [1], [7], [8] approaches. A single tree model may not be as accurate as desired. One effective way to remedy this is to apply ensemble methods [5]-[7], [9]-[11], such as the Random Forest (RF) [5]. Larger tree ensembles typically improve accuracy, but demand more computation resources, especially for hardware implementation. Many methods have been proposed to address this issue. The motivation arouses from the fact that tree models usually demands much less computation resource comparing to neural networks, making them extremely potential for wearable devices and embedded systems at the edge nodes of the IoT [7], [11], [12]. Moreover, due to their inherent structures, tree ensembles are ideal for exploiting the computational parallelism on FPGA [1], [4], [7]-[9], [11], [13].","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509501/8525497/08525906.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Work-in-Progress: Hierarchical Ensemble Learning for Resource-Aware FPGA Computing","doi":"10.1109/CODESISSS.2018.8525906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CODESISSS.2018.8525906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2018-Oct. 5 2018","displayDocTitle":"Work-in-Progress: Hierarchical Ensemble Learning for Resource-Aware FPGA Computing","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232674","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-5 Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8525906/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Work-in-Progress: Hierarchical Ensemble Learning for Resource-Aware FPGA Computing","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"04D_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042453S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2018-Oct. 5 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509501","isNumber":"8525497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509501","xplore-issue":"8525497","articleId":"8525906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525915,"authors":[{"name":"Manuele Rusci","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna"],"firstName":"Manuele","lastName":"Rusci","id":"37085773071"},{"name":"Alessandro Capotondi","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Capotondi","id":"37085501625"},{"name":"Francesco Conti","affiliation":["D-ITET, ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Conti","id":"37085445513"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["D-ITET, ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37085360741"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5563-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525915","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525915","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Convolution","Artificial neural networks","Memory management","Libraries","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","embedded systems","hardware-software codesign","learning (artificial intelligence)","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","hardware-software codesign","random-access storage","cryptography","parallel processing","field programmable gate arrays","neural nets","invasive software","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine Learning","Quantized Neural Network","ARM Microcontrollers"]}],"abstract":"The following topics are dealt with: embedded systems;

The performance evaluation in term of the ergodic system capacity shows that the proposed CA HBF achieves the same performance as the fully-digital capacity-aware beamforming scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICMCS.2018.8525955","publicationTitle":"2018 6th International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems (ICMCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 6th International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems (ICMCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488380/8525492/08525955.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCS.2018.8525955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity-Aware Hybrid beamforming for Multi-User Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525955/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity-Aware Hybrid beamforming for Multi-User Massive MIMO","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18248217","htmlLink":"/document/8525955/","conferenceDate":"10-12 May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity-Aware Hybrid beamforming for Multi-User Massive MIMO","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICMCS18_paper_117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039734S","chronDate":"10-12 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488380","isNumber":"8525492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488380","xplore-issue":"8525492","articleId":"8525955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525964,"authors":[{"name":"Honghui Tang","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Honghui","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086511207"},{"name":"Tao Qin","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Qin","id":"37086512631"},{"name":"Zhijian Hui","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhijian","lastName":"Hui","id":"37086511626"},{"name":"Pengyu Cheng","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Pengyu","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086512355"},{"name":"Wensong Bai","affiliation":["College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wensong","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086512348"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7819-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7818-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7820-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525964","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Configurable and Aperiodic Pseudo Random Number Generator in FPGA","abstract":"Pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) play an important role in many fields such as encryption and hardware testing. One common structure of PRNGs is linear feedback shifting register (LFSR), which generate a n-bit sequence from a specific seed. However, the sequence of random numbers can be predicted given a fixed seed and some sequences of generated numbers. Considering the drawbacks of available LSFR-based PRNGs, in this paper we devised a configurable and aperiodic LSFR-based PRNG, which utilize the unpredictability of metastable state widely existed in digital circuits. In this case, the sequence of random numbers is almost unpredictable and can meet the requirements of most applications especially critical ones. Then we implemented it on FPGA and the simulation results indicate that the proposed PRNG has better performance in generating random numbers with high randomness.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Logic gates","Generators","Field programmable gate arrays","Multiplexing","Filtering","Digital circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","random number generation","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","pseudorandom number generators","encryption","hardware testing","n-bit sequence","configurable LSFR-based PRNG","aperiodic LSFR-based PRNG","linear feedback shifting register","digital circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LFSR","FPGA","PRNGs","aperiodic","metastable state","configurable"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525964","doi":"10.1109/CIRSYSSIM.2018.8525964","startPage":"47","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Circuits, System and Simulation (ICCSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Circuits, System and Simulation (ICCSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8513693/8525495/08525964.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRSYSSIM.2018.8525964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8525964/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Configurable and Aperiodic Pseudo Random Number Generator in FPGA","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18232795","htmlLink":"/document/8525964/","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Configurable and Aperiodic Pseudo Random Number Generator in FPGA","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"Ac-c.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100917S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8513693","isNumber":"8525495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8513693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8525495","articleId":"8525964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8525985,"authors":[{"name":"Hanie Ghaedrahmati","affiliation":["CARFIC Laboratory School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE), Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hanie","lastName":"Ghaedrahmati","id":"37086508997"},{"name":"Jianfeng Xue","affiliation":["CARFIC Laboratory School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE), Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086513257"},{"name":"Jing Jin","affiliation":["CARFIC Laboratory School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE), Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Jin","id":"37406881200"},{"name":"Jianjun Zhou","affiliation":["CARFIC Laboratory School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE), Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37404023600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7819-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7818-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7820-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8525985","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise shaping","Capacitors","Passive filters","Energy resolution","Switches","Gain","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","analogue-digital conversion","capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","flip-flops","logic design","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog-to-digital converter","dynamic amplifier-based filter","noise-shaping architecture","peak signal-to-noise-distortion ratio","ADC","CMOS technology","spurious-free-dynamic-range","capacitor-DAC array","low-power noise-shaping","power 1.0 mW","frequency 20.0 MHz","conductance 160.0 MS","size 40.0 nm","voltage 1.1 V","noise figure 68.0 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog-to-digital converter","successive approximation register","noise-shaping","dynamic-amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8525985","abstract":"A 10-bit 160MS/s 20MHz bandwidth low-power noise-shaping successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using a novel dynamic amplifier-based filter is presented.

The low-order harmonics used in the proposed scheme are determined as the conjugate (M/2 - 1)th and the (M/2 + 1)th harmonics for M = 4n, or the conjugate (M/2 - 2)th and the (M/2 + 2)th harmonics for M = 4n + 2, or the conjugate [(M - 1)/2]th and the [(M + 1)/2]th harmonics for M = 2n + 1, n = 1, 2, 3 . . .. The simulations show the effectiveness of the scheme for the eightand nine-level all-optical phase quantization. Furthermore, the application of the scheme to the all-optical phase regeneration is validated. An improved method with two cascading stages is also proposed and validated to achieve a monotonic step-like phase- phase transfer characteristic for the optimized all-optical phase quantization. This proposed scheme provides a new way for multilevel phase quantization and multi-level phase shift keying regeneration to meet the ever increasing demand for the bandwidth in fiber-optic communication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526291/","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2018","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"18284228","volume":"36","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Multi-Level Phase Quantization Based on Phase-Sensitive Amplification With Low-Order Harmonics","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331008 and 61871051"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Multi-Level Phase Quantization Based on Phase-Sensitive Amplification With Low-Order Harmonics","sourcePdf":"jlt-wang-2879922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071792S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8547159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8547159","articleId":"8526291","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8526292,"authors":[{"name":"Razan Abdulhammed","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bridgeport, Bridgeport, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Razan","lastName":"Abdulhammed","id":"37085803882"},{"name":"Miad Faezipour","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bridgeport, Bridgeport, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Miad","lastName":"Faezipour","orcid":"0000-0003-2684-0887","id":"37296205600"},{"name":"Abdelshakour Abuzneid","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bridgeport, Bridgeport, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Abdelshakour","lastName":"Abuzneid","orcid":"0000-0001-5416-0315","id":"37869793000"},{"name":"Arafat AbuMallouh","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Manhattan College, Riverdale, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Arafat","lastName":"AbuMallouh","id":"37086000223"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2475-1472"}],"articleNumber":"8526292","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2020},"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"173 KB","file":"/ielx7/7782634/8613119/8526292/graphical_abstract/lsens-gagraphic-2879990.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/7782634/8613119/8526292/graphical_abstract/lsens-gagraphic-2879990.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526292","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Forestry","Intrusion detection","Measurement","Sensors","Data integration","Neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","deep neural network (DNN)","imbalanced network traffic","random forest (RF)","variational autoencoder (VAE)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSENS.2018.2879990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7782634/8613119/08526292.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSENS.2018.2879990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8613119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep and Machine Learning Approaches for Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection of Imbalanced Network Traffic","abstract":"Recently, cybersecurity threats have increased dramatically, and the techniques used by the attackers continue to evolve and become ingenious during the attack.

The objective of this article is to utilize various techniques for handling imbalanced datasets to build an effective intrusion detection system from the up-to-date Coburg Intrusion Detection Dataset-001 (CIDDS-001) dataset. The effectiveness of sampling methods on CIDDS-001 is carefully studied and experimentally evaluated through deep neural networks, random forest, voting, variational autoencoder, and stacking machine learning classifiers. The proposed system was able to detect attacks with up to 99.99% accuracy when handling the imbalanced class distribution with fewer samples, making it more convenient in real-time data fusion problems that target data classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","externalId":"7101404","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8526292/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","volume":"3","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep and Machine Learning Approaches for Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection of Imbalanced Network Traffic","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Bridgeport Seed Money Grant","grantNumber":"UB-SMG 2018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep and Machine Learning Approaches for Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection of Imbalanced Network Traffic","sourcePdf":"lsens-faezipour-2879990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082822S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7782634","isNumber":"8613119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7782634","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8613119","articleId":"8526292","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8526301,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Stanslaski","affiliation":["Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/8599184/8526301/stans-2880148-small.gif","p":["Scott Stanslaski received the Bachelor of Science and master's degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

Blocking mainly results from the block-level quantization of the luma component, while color bleeding is mainly caused by the subsampling and quantization of chroma components. Restoring luma can reduce blocking distortion, but with little influence on color bleeding. On the contrary, color bleeding can be removed via chroma components restoration. This letter proposes a deep wide-activated residual network for reducing blocking and color bleeding artifacts simultaneously, in which the luma and chroma components are jointly restored. Chroma components usually suffer from more severe distortion than the luma component due to subsampling and coarse quantization. Thus, we use the luma component to guide the restoration of chroma components. Moreover, we reduce blocking and color bleeding artifacts in low-resolution space via pixel shuffle-based decimation and assembling, which allows to obtain high restoration speed. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on joint blocking and color bleeding artifacts reduction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Hemorrhaging","Image restoration","Image coding","Quantization (signal)","Transform coding","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image colour analysis","image resolution","image restoration","network theory (graphs)","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color bleeding artifacts","4:2:0 JPEG-compressed images","block-level quantization","luma component","chroma components restoration","deep wide-activated residual network","joint blocking artifacts reduction","chroma components subsampling","chroma components quantization","luma restoration","blocking distortion reduction","low-resolution space","pixel shuffle-based decimation","pixel shuffle-based assembling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["JPEG","blocking","color bleeding","4:2:0","wide-activated residual network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2018.2880146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/8539853/08526304.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8539853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2018.2880146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Wide-Activated Residual Network Based Joint Blocking and Color Bleeding Artifacts Reduction for 4:2:0 JPEG-Compressed Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Wide-Activated Residual Network Based Joint Blocking and Color Bleeding Artifacts Reduction for 4:2:0 JPEG-Compressed Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526304/","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8526304/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18265997","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871279 and 61471248"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2012017yjsy159"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201706240037"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Wide-Activated Residual Network Based Joint Blocking and Color Bleeding Artifacts Reduction for 4:2:0 JPEG-Compressed Images","sourcePdf":"lsp-he-2880146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102747S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8539853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8539853","articleId":"8526304","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":8526307,"authors":[{"name":"Adonis Bogris","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Computer Engineering, University of West Attica, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"p":["Adonis Bogris was born in Athens, Greece, on June 16, 1975.

In image vision, convolutional neural networks (CNN) stand out. This kind of network is expensive in terms of computational resources due to the large number of operations required to process a frame. In recent years, several frame-based chip solutions to deploy CNN for real time have been developed. Despite the good results in power and accuracy given by these solutions, the number of operations is still high, due the complexity of the current network models. However, it is possible to reduce the number of operations using different computer vision techniques other than frame-based, e.g., neuromorphic event-based techniques. There exist several neuromorphic vision sensors whose pixels detect changes in luminosity. Inspired in the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron, we propose in this manuscript an event-based field-programmable gate array (FPGA) multiconvolution system. Its main novelty is the combination of a memory arbiter for efficient memory access to allow row-by-row kernel processing. This system is able to convolve 64 filters across multiple kernel sizes, from 1 \u00d7 1 to 7 \u00d7 7, with latencies of 1.3 \u03bcs and 9.01 \u03bcs, respectively, generating a continuous flow of output events.

The SS network is considered to encompass device-to-device (D2D) transmissions between a single primary transmitter (PT) and multiple primary receivers (PRs), placed in distinctive zones around the PT. Power allocation is performed optimally so that the target rate of each application demanded by the PRs are adequately met. When the PT fails to meet the target rates over PT \u2192 PR D2D links, it transmits cooperatively through an appropriate secondary transmitter (ST) in the SS network, which acts as an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. The ST's basis for selection is the PT \u2192 ST channel state and power level at the ST. Use of game theory for solving the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem has also been quantified. ZBGrEEn introduces zone factor for determining the transmission time for each zone in the SS network. This time determines the energy consumption at the user terminals, thereby impacting its battery lifetime. The efficiency of the proposed scheme has been validated through simulation results, with the enhancement in battery lifetime of up to 46.28% achievable for the PT. Game theory is also observed to be rewarding in battery lifetime augmentation, especially for ultradense networks (UDNs). Performance of other user terminals in the network can be similarly evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2879949","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8612978/08526311.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2879949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"405","endPage":"419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zonal-Based GrEEn Algorithm for Augmenting the Battery Life in Spectrum Shared Networks via D2D Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Zonal-Based GrEEn Algorithm for Augmenting the Battery Life in Spectrum Shared Networks via D2D Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526311/","volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8526311/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18409501","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"5G and IoT Lab"},{"fundingName":"DoECE"},{"fundingName":"TBIC"},{"fundingName":"Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zonal-Based GrEEn Algorithm for Augmenting the Battery Life in Spectrum Shared Networks via D2D Communication","sourcePdf":"tvt-jha-2879949-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165447S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8612978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8612978","articleId":"8526311","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8526313,"authors":[{"name":"Yichen Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8694093/8526313/zhou-2879987-small.gif","p":["Yichen Zhou (M'18) was born in January 1990, Jiyuan, China.

For an efficient integration of photovoltaic generation, a gain scheduling wide-area damping controller (WADC) is designed to guarantee system damping performance under a wide-area signal delay and a changing operating condition, which could be aggravated by the fluctuant and uncertain photovoltaic generation. A linear parameter-varying (LPV) model is proposed to represent all possible operating conditions within varying ranges of the photovoltaic generation and the load. Then, a tensor product (TP) model transformation is applied to transform the LPV model into a TP model. Based on the TP model, a parallel distributed compensation controller (PDC) framework is adopted to design the gain scheduling WADC, which is solved by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) considering the accommodation to the random interval delay. In addition, a staircase basis function method is proposed to reduce the conservatism of LMIs within the PDC framework. The gain of the proposed WADC will be adjusted according to the operating condition acknowledged through the real-time scheduling and control center, once a wide-area oscillation is detected. Finally, the performance of the proposed WADC is verified by a 2-area 4-machine system and a 68-bus 16-machine system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Photovoltaic

Specifically, an effective method to utilize the activation pattern constraint of GSM signal vector per user in the posterior probability computation of scalar symbol node is derived. Furthermore, a simple while effective damping strategy is introduced in AMP detector to guarantee convergence in correlated channels. Second, for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with IM in rapidly time-varying channels, the damped AMP detector is further studied.

However, using cloud resource is a double-edged sword because of the potentially enormous network energy consumption of mobile devices. In this paper, we study the mobile device resource management problem for application throughput fairness and energy efficiency in computation offloading environment. Our problem seeks to optimize task arrival rates, scheduling for local processing and offloading, CPU clock speed, and network interface selection, so as to maximize the energy-utility efficiency defined as achievable utility per unit energy consumption. The efficiency metric has a fractional form that is hard to deal with in general. To address this difficulty, we modify a general Lyapunov optimization technique and derive a series of short-term problems that change over time with respect to an unknown objective parameter. Then, we derive an offloading algorithm and prove that the algorithm maximizes the long-term energy-utility efficiency. Trace-driven simulations demonstrate that our algorithm achieves high-energy efficiency while maintaining throughput fairness among applications running on a mobile device.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Computation Offloading for Application Throughput Fairness and Energy Efficiency","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2868679","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8605558/08526324.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2868679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Computation Offloading for Application Throughput Fairness and Energy Efficiency","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8526324/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18392509","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT Research and Development Program of MSIP/IITP through the Research on Adaptive Machine Learning Technology Development for Intelligent Autonomous Digital Companion","grantNumber":"2016-0-00563"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government MSIT","grantNumber":"NRF-2018R1A5A1059921"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through NRF"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010449","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2018R1D1A1B07048388"},{"fundingName":"BK21 Plus Project of the National Research Foundation of Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Computation Offloading for Application Throughput Fairness and Energy Efficiency","sourcePdf":"twc-lee-2868679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181464S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8526324","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8526328,"authors":[{"name":"Subham Sahoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8721605/8526328/shaoo-2879886-small.gif","p":["Subham Sahoo (S\u201916\u2013M\u201918) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla, India, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, New Delhi, India, in 2018.","He was a Visiting Student with the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Cardiff University, Cardiff, U.K., in 2017.

Considering a set of conventional cyber attacks, the detection becomes fairly easy for distributed observer based techniques. However, a well-planned set of balanced attacks, termed as the stealth attack, can bypass the conventional observer based detection theory as the control objectives are met without any physical error involved. In this paper, we discuss the formulation and associated scope of instability from stealth attacks to deceive distributed observers realizing the necessary and sufficient conditions to model such attacks. To address this issue, a novel cooperative vulnerability factor (CVF) framework for each agent is introduced, which accurately identifies the attacked agent(s) under various scenarios. To facilitate detection under worst cases, the CVFs from the secondary voltage control sublayer is strategically cross coupled to the current sublayer, which ultimately disorients the control objectives in the presence of stealth attacks and provides a clear norm for triggering defense mechanisms. Finally, the performance of the proposed detection strategy is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and experimentally validated for false data injection and stealth attacks on sensors and communication links.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2018.2879886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8721605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2018.2879886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8721605/08526328.pdf","startPage":"8162","endPage":"8174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stealth Cyber-Attack Detection Strategy for DC Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Stealth Cyber-Attack Detection Strategy for DC Microgrids","volume":"34","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8526328/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18708260","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526328/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Academic Research Fund Tier 1 from the Ministry of Education, Government of Singapore","grantNumber":"R-263-000-C27-133"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stealth Cyber-Attack Detection Strategy for DC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tpel-peng-2879886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112318S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8721605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"8721605","articleId":"8526328","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526331,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Chao Bo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8602378/8526331/bo-2876230-small.gif","p":["Xi Chao Bo was born in Shaanxi, China, in 1993.

They are difficult to detect using conventional protection relays because the fault current is insufficient to cause tripping. The delay in detecting HIFs can result in severe bushfires and energy losses; hence a high throughput, low latency detection scheme needs to be developed for HIF detection. Moreover, the complexities associated with HIF detection demands signal processing techniques combined with artificial intelligence to achieve higher detection accuracy. This paper proposes a sustainable deep learning-based approach in an edge device, that can be mounted on top of a power pole to detect HIFs in real-time. Data acquisition, feature extraction, and deep learning based fault identification are performed in an embedded edge node to achieve higher throughput, reduced latency as well as offload the network traffic. Furthermore, optimization techniques such as hardware parallelism and pipelining are adapted to achieve real-time fault identification on edge devices while ensuring the efficient usage of its limited resources. Real-time implementation of the proposed system is validated through laboratory experiments and the results demonstrate the suitability of edge computing to detect HIFs in terms of reduced detection latency (115.2 ms) and higher detection accuracy (98.67%).","doi":"10.1109/TSUSC.2018.2879960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7742329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSUSC.2018.2879960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274860/7742329/08526333.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sustainable Deep Learning at Grid Edge for Real-time High Impedance Fault Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Sustainable Deep Learning at Grid Edge for Real-time High Impedance Fault Detection","volume":"PP","issue":"99","isEarlyAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526333/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","earlyAccessFlag":"yes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sustainable Deep Learning at Grid Edge for Real-time High Impedance Fault Detection","sourcePdf":"tsusc-2879960-pp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02555S","isNumber":"7742329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274860","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8526333","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Early Access Articles","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526337,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Demir","affiliation":["Human Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Mesa, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221037/8664414/8526337/demir-2877482-small.gif","p":["Mustafa Demir (M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in simulation, modeling and applied cognitive science with a focus on team coordination dynamics in human-autonomy teaming from Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, in Spring 2017.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Dr. Nancy Cooke at Ira A.

The current study examines team coordination dynamics with an extended version of the NDS methods and assumes that its relationship with team performance for human-autonomy teams (HAT) is nonlinear. In this study, three team conditions are compared with the goals of better understanding how team coordination dynamics differ between all-human teams and HAT and how these dynamics relate to team performance and team situation awareness. Each condition was determined based on manipulation of the .pilot role: in the first condition (synthetic) the pilot role was played by a synthetic agent, in the second condition (control) it was a randomly assigned participant, and in the third condition (experimenter) it was an expert who used a role specific coordination script. NDS indices revealed that synthetic teams were rigid, followed by experimenter teams, who were metastable, and control teams, who were unstable. Experimenter teams demonstrated better team effectiveness (i.e., better team performance and team situation awareness) than control and synthetic teams. Team coordination stability is related to team performance and team situation awareness in anonlinear manner with optimal performance and situation awareness associated with metastability coupled with flexibility. This result means that future development of synthetic teams should address these coordination dynamics, specifically, rigidity in coordination.","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2018.2877482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/8664414/08526337.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8664414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2018.2877482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Team Coordination and Effectiveness in Human-Autonomy Teaming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526337","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6221037/8664414/8526337-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"Team Coordination and Effectiveness in Human-Autonomy Teaming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526337/","publicationDate":"April 2019","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18630194","htmlLink":"/document/8526337/","volume":"49","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N000141110844 and N000141712382"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BCS 1255922"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Team Coordination and Effectiveness in Human-Autonomy Teaming","sourcePdf":"thms-demir-2877482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137928S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"8664414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8664414","articleId":"8526337","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526339,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Jawad","affiliation":["COMSATS University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/9447310/8526339/jawad-2879948-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Jawad received the PhD degree from North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA.

Variations in parameters, such as power demand, electricity price, and renewable power generation effects the data center's power consumption cost. Therefore, in this paper, a smart power management system based on a robust energy cost optimization algorithm is proposed for the data center. The designed robust optimization algorithm coordinates data center workload, battery bank, diesel generators, renewable power, and trade electricity price in real-time and day-ahead power market to reduce expected energy consumption cost. The uncertain parameters, such as data center workload and renewable power are computed using forecasting algorithms. The optimization algorithm is used to limit unbalance power purchase from real-time power market due to uncertainty of real-time electricity price. The algorithm formulation is obtained using mixed-integer linear programming. Moreover, a model to calculate prices to be used in service level agreements with data centers\u2019 clients for on-demand cloud services is designed considering operational cost of the data center. Simulations are performed on actual data center workload, weather parameters, and electricity price. The results have shown that the proposed methodology is an effective tool to minimize data center operational cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526339/","volume":"9","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8526339/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 April-June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Optimization Technique for Energy Cost Minimization of Cloud Data Centers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Optimization Technique for Energy Cost Minimization of Cloud Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tcc-jawad-2879948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143218S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"9447310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9447310","articleId":"8526339","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8526340,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Niu","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8723653/8526340/niu-2880007-small.gif","p":["Kun Niu is an Associate Professor with the School of Software Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

While that past approaches for short-term traffic prediction have existed for some time, emerging smart transportation technologies require the traffic prediction capability to be both fast and scalable to full urban networks. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network, named L-CNN based on CNN and LSTM, and develop an effective real-time prediction model to forecast the most likely potential passenger for taxi drivers. It is noteworthy that our model can be easily extended to other real-time traffic prediction problems, such as road traffic and flow prediction. Finally, we test our method based on GPS trajectories generated by Cheng Du taxi. The method presented provides passenger prediction over 15-min intervals for up to 1 h in advance and the results prove the efficiency of our predicting system.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2880007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8723653/08526340.pdf","startPage":"4122","endPage":"4129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2880007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8723653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Taxi-Passenger Prediction With L-CNN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526340/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Taxi-Passenger Prediction With L-CNN","volume":"68","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8526340/","publicationDate":"May 2019","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18708476","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2016YFE0204500"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671081"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4172042"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Taxi-Passenger Prediction With L-CNN","sourcePdf":"tvt-cheng-2880007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062644S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8723653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8723653","articleId":"8526340","onlineDate":"07 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8526351,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Farahmand","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Majid Farahmand received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran, in 1996, the M.S. degree in communications engineering from the University of Science and Technology in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in communications systems from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, in 2018.","His research interests include cloud computing, cellular networks, and computer networks."]},"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Farahmand","orcid":"0000-0003-2195-536X","id":"37720389400"},{"name":"Abbas Mohammadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Abbas Mohammadi received the B.Sc. degree from Tehran University, Tehran, Iran, in 1988, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, in 1995 and 1999, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","Since 2000, he has been with the Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, where he is currently a Professor.

Using stochastic geometry tools, analytical expressions are derived to describe downlink ergodic rate and coverage probability for coordination multipoint joint transmission in C-RAN. Based on these expressions and by taking advantage of central processing and coordination in baseband unit pool, power allocation among remote radio heads is optimized using the WSB. The WSB optimization algorithm is based on water-filling power allocation strategy and redistributing the power among RRHs. The improvement in both EE and ergodic rate is achieved. The improvement in EE is pronounced up to 28% using WSB technique compare to the equal power beamforming method in the proposed C-RAN network.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2018.2871130","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/8506641/08526351.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2018.2871130","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","startPage":"151","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Sparse Beamforming in Cloud Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Sparse Beamforming in Cloud Radio Access Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526351/","volume":"41","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8526351/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Summer 2018","accessionNumber":"18211558","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Sparse Beamforming in Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"cjece-farahmand-2871130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090008S","chronDate":"Summer  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"8506641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","xplore-issue":"8506641","articleId":"8526351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8526353,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Schinianakis","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6731002/8526352/8526353/schoi-2860381-small.gif","p":["Dimitrios Schinianakis\u00a0(IEEE SM \u201818) received his diploma\n in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2005 and his PhD in 2013, both from the University of Patras,\n Greece.\u00a0His current research interests include 5G/IoT security architectures, cryptography, post-quantum and\n homomorphic encryption, and computer arithmetic.\u00a0 Since 2008, in parallel with his PhD studies, he has been\n employed in Nokia, first as a Product Line Manager and then as Senior Security Researcher, focusing on IoT and 5G\n security strategies.

In this apocalyptic scenario, the world of cryptography would be in a state of shock, since almost everything that forms the foundations of current security would collapse. Indeed, the presence of a quantum computer would render state-of-the-art, public-key cryptography useless. All the underlying assumptions about the intractability of mathematical problems that offer confident levels of security today would no longer apply in the presence of a quantum computer. But are we really doomed? Is cryptography dead? Well, luckily no. This paper examines the technologies that will enable crypto to survive the post-apocalyptic world of quantum computing. There are many things yet to be done to offer an environment as safe as current crypto does, but the tools are there. It is now a game of engineering, pro-active standardization and ingenious mathematics, while following a careful development approach to pave a safe way through the qubits inferno.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526353/","volume":"23","htmlLink":"/document/8526353/","accessionNumber":"18231853","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quo Vadis Qubit?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quo Vadis Qubit?","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"bltj-schoinianakis-2860381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08406S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6731002","isNumber":"8526352","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","xplore-issue":"8526352","articleId":"8526353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"Bell Periodical","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8526364,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this work, we propose a semantic level shadow segmentation by using generative adversarial networks and created a dataset of pre-processed images for training, validation and test. In this way, we trained a generator network that produces shadow masks with condition on a satellite image patch and tries to fool a discriminator, which is trained to discern if a given mask comes from the ground truth or from the generator model.

A natural implementation of SoC circuit uses global clock, but in DSM technology (Deep-Sub-Micron) global clock signal causes several problems. An interesting style for SoC design that reduces the problems of the global clock is the GALS (Globally Asynchronous, Locally Synchronous) paradigm. Currently, the major drawback in the design of a GALS system, shows to be the asynchronous interface. This paper proposes a novel asynchronous wrapper based on a unique port controller aiming to the point-to-point GALS style and easily generalized to multi-point GALS systems. The proposed asynchronous wrapper allows the communication between modules to be performed in the two-phase handshake protocol, which reduces the latency time when compared to the previous ones, and it is robust with respect to essential hazard. A comparison with seven wrappers found in literature shows that the proposed wrapper leads to an average reduction in latency time of 61.1% and average reduction in area of 58% in the FPGA (Field Programmable Gated array) platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE XXV International Conference on Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computing (INTERCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484861/8526365/08526456.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE XXV International Conference on Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computing (INTERCON)","doi":"10.1109/INTERCON.2018.8526456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTERCON.2018.8526456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Low-Latency Robust Asynchronous Interfaces for GALS Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays","Hazards","Table lookup","Protocols","Logic gates","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GALS system","asynchronous interface","unique port controller","point-to-point GALS style","multipoint GALS systems","FPGA implementation","complex digital systems","SoC circuit","global clock","DSM technology","SoC design","system-on-chip","low-latency robust asynchronous interfaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous logic","wrapper","GALS","synthesis logic","communication ports"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Low-Latency Robust Asynchronous Interfaces for GALS Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8526456/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18248191","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of Low-Latency Robust Asynchronous Interfaces for GALS Systems","confLoc":"Lima, Peru","sourcePdf":"paper_99.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060388S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484861","isNumber":"8526365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484861","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8526365","articleId":"8526456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8526503,"authors":[{"name":"Yadong Huang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yadong","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Yueting Chai","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yueting","lastName":"Chai"},{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Jianping Shen","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Shen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"8526503","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1922},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Portals","Ontologies","Organizations","Reliability","Cyberspace","History","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic commerce","parallel processing","retail data processing","supply and demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel processing","intelligent matching transactions","personalized portal","social contact","demand satisfaction","supply release","subject information synchronization","next-generation e-commerce platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["e-commerce","personalized portal","accurate demand","reliable supply","smart cyberspace"]}],"abstract":"E-commerce, driven by computer and internet technology, has experienced a significant growth in almost all fields during the past two decades. E-commerce has significantly changed the rules of business. Numerous research institutions and enterprises have made e-commerce more intelligent and convenient. Here, we propose a novel prototype of next-generation e-commerce platform with an architecture framework and theoretical models. Each subject, including the individual, enterprise, and administrative department, has his/her personalized portal to complete the subject information synchronization, supply release, demand satisfaction, and social contact. By using the personalized portal, instead of the traditional trading platform, the consumers and suppliers can complete intelligent matching transactions without intermediate traders. Moreover, the overall transaction process can be reviewed, making the transaction safer, more transparent, and more interesting. Moreover, the interconnected personalized portals solve the isolated islands of information, and the counterparts support parallel processing. Thus, this may improve the operating efficiency of the entire society.","doi":"10.26599/TST.2018.9010067","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971803/8526498/08526503.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.26599/TST.2018.9010067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture of next-generation e-commerce platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Architecture of next-generation e-commerce platform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526503/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18813830","volume":"24","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Architecture of next-generation e-commerce platform","sourcePdf":"1829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038709S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","isNumber":"8526498","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8526503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526533,"authors":[{"name":"Yufeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8657433/8526533/wang-2878191-small.gif","p":["Yufeng Wang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2018 from the School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, where he is currently working toward the master's degree in electrical engineering."]},"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-6739-927X","id":"37086588205"},{"name":"Weilin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8657433/8526533/li-2878191-small.gif","p":["Weilin Li (S'10\u2013M'13) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.) degree from the Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems, E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany, in 2013, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, as an Associate Professor.

Therefore, the dc circuit breaker plays an important role in ensuring the normal work of a dc microgrid. In this paper, a novel bidirectional dc solid-state circuit breaker is proposed to realize the bidirectional flow of energy, which ensures the higher operating efficiency of the dc microgrid. Compared with other solid-state circuit breakers, the proposed novel topology has simpler structure, common ground, and fewer components. First, this paper makes a detailed analysis of the different working stages of the circuit when the fault occurs in combination with simulation results of the circuit topology. Then, the standard of selecting the components through the calculation and analysis of the circuit is given in this paper. Finally, the performance of the novel bidirectional solid-state circuit breaker is verified by experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Bidirectional Solid-State Circuit Breaker for DC

Since edge networks and computing resources are highly dynamic, handling such dynamics is essential for providing high-quality MAR services. In this paper, we design a new network protocol named DARE (dynamic adaptive AR over the edge) that enables mobile users to dynamically change their AR configurations according to wireless channel conditions and computation workloads in edge servers. The dynamic configuration adaptations reduce the service latency of MAR users and maximize the quality of augmentation (QoA) under varying network conditions and computation workloads. Considering the video frame size and computation model, i.e., object detection algorithms, as two key parameters in adapting the AR configuration, we develop analytical models to characterize the impact of these parameters on QoA and the service latency. Then, we design optimization mechanisms on both the edge server and AR devices to guide the AR configuration adaptation and server computation resource allocation. The performance of the DARE protocol is validated through a small-scale testbed implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2018.00011","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International

Systems","abstract":"Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has been recently exploited as a hardware accelerator to improve the performance of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). However, GPU-accelerated NFV systems suffer from significant latency variation when multiple network functions (NFs) are co-located in the same machine, which prevents operators from supporting latency Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Existing research efforts to address this problem can only guarantee a limited number of SLOs with very low resource utilization efficiency. In this paper, we present the Grus framework to support latency SLOs in GPU-accelerated NFV systems. Grus thoroughly analyzes the sources of latency variation and proposes three design principles: (1) dynamic batch size setting is needed to bound packet batching latency in CPU; (2) a reordering mechanism for data transfer over PCI-E is required to guarantee the stalling time; and (3) maximizing concurrency in GPU is necessary to avoid NF execution waiting time. Guided by the principles, Grus consists of two logical layers including an infrastructure layer and a scheduling layer. The infrastructure layer is equipped with an in-CPU Reorder-able Worker Pool that could adjust batching size and packet transfer order, and in-GPU Controllable Concurrent Executors to provide maximized concurrency. The scheduling layer runs a heuristic algorithm to perform accurate and fast scheduling to guarantee SLOs based on our prediction models. We have implemented a prototype of Grus. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Grus can significantly reduce latency variation and satisfy 4.5 \u00d7 more SLO terms than state-of-the-art solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526813/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Sep 2018","accessionNumber":"18232856","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Grus: Enabling Latency SLOs for GPU-Accelerated NFV Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grus: Enabling Latency SLOs for GPU-Accelerated NFV Systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"604300a154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.167634S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526479","isNumber":"8526788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526479","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8526788","articleId":"8526813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8526814,"authors":[{"name":"Satadal Sengupta","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Satadal","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37085768671"},{"name":"Niloy Ganguly","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Niloy","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37401796200"},{"name":"Sandip Chakraborty","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"38022635200"},{"name":"Pradipta De","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computing, Georgia Southern University, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Pradipta","lastName":"De","id":"37085571845"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6043-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6044-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"8526814","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":921},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526814","abstract":"A large fraction of video content providers have adopted adaptive bitrate streaming over HTTP. The client player typically runs an adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm to decide upon the most optimal quality for the next few seconds of video playback. State-of-the-art ABR algorithms attempt to achieve an optimal trade-off among the competing objectives of high bitrate, less rebuffering, and high smoothness, in the face of unpredictable bandwidth variability. However, optimal bandwidth utilization does not necessarily ensure high quality of experience (QoE). Different users have different content preferences even within the same video, due to differences in team loyalties (in sport), character preferences (in movies and soaps), and so on. In this work, we present HotDASH, a system which enables opportune prefetching of user-preferred temporal video segments (called hotspots). HotDASH implements a prefetch module in the open source DASH player dash.js, which is powered by an optimal prefetch and bitrate decision engine. The decision engine is designed as a cascaded reinforcement learning (RL) model, implemented using a state-of-the-art actor-critic RL algorithm over a neural network. We train the neural network using trace-driven simulations over a large variety of bandwidth conditions. HotDASH outperforms all baseline algorithms, with a 16.2% QoE improvement over the best-performing baseline, and achieves 14.31% better average bitrate due to its ability to prefetch opportunistically.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2018.00026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526788","startPage":"165","endPage":"175","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526479/8526788/08526814.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018

Our objective is to implement a new 5G firewall that allows the detection, differentiation and selective blocking of 5G network traffic in the edge-to-core network segment of a 5G infrastructure, using a hardware-accelerated framework based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), developed using the P4 language. The proposed 5G firewall has been prototyped with the new capabilities proposed empirically validated.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2018.00066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2018.00066","startPage":"446","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526479/8526788/08526854.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-Accelerated Firewall for 5G Mobile Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526854/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Accelerated Firewall for 5G Mobile Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18249087","publicationDate":"Sep 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526854/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Accelerated Firewall for 5G Mobile Networks","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"604300a446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035346S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526479","isNumber":"8526788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526479","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8526788","articleId":"8526854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526867,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Elyasi","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, US"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Elyasi"},{"name":"Mohammad Arjomand","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Arjomand","id":"37400275000"},{"name":"Anand Sivasubramaniam","affiliation":["The Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Sivasubramaniam","id":"37273174700"},{"name":"Mahmut T.

This is particularly significant in the delays due to queueing for service from individual NAND-flash chips that can take dozens/hundreds of microseconds to perform the read/write operations. Owing to the no-write-in-place policy that is employed in flash chips, writes are inherently suited to be redirected to chips with lower load, in case their original destination chip is overloaded. However, to date, there has been no work to redirect read requests, since they cannot be serviced by other chips, which do not have the data. While blindly replicating all the data everywhere seems very promising from a read redirection perspective, doing so results in high space overheads, high write/replication overheads and lower endurance. This paper presents a novel approach to selective replication, wherein the popularity of data is used to figure out the \"what\", \"how much\", \"where\" and \"when\" questions for replication. Leveraging value locality/popularity, that is often observed in practice, popular data is replicated across multiple chips to provide more opportunities for dynamic read redirection to less loaded flash chips. Using extensive workload traces running over weeks from real systems, we show that our Read Redirected SSD (RR-SSD) can provide up to 45% improvement in read performance, with average improvement of 23.9%, and up to 40% improvement when considering both read and write requests, with 16% improvement on average.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00009","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526867.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content Popularity-Based Selective Replication for Read Redirection in SSDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526867/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Content Popularity-Based Selective Replication for Read Redirection in SSDs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18232844","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526867/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content Popularity-Based Selective Replication for Read Redirection in SSDs","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"688600a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14523S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526478","isNumber":"8526858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526478","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8526858","articleId":"8526867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526869,"authors":[{"name":"James Byron","affiliation":["Center for Research in Storage Systems, University of California, Santa Cruz"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Byron","id":"37086517595"},{"name":"Darrell D.

Archival systems must store valuable data for years while adapting to changing user needs, capacity, and performance requirements. Storage devices differ in terms of performance, capacity, reliability, acquisition cost, power consumption, and the rates at which their features change over time. As a result, choosing the best storage technology to use for an archive has become increasingly challenging with the proliferation of new technologies alongside existing ones. We have designed a simulator that models the capacity, performance, acquisition cost, and power cost of an archival system using the characteristics of the drives and media that comprise it. We simulate and compare four storage technologies that exhibit different cost and performance characteristics: tape, optical disc, hard disk, and NAND flash SSD. We evaluate the total cost of ownership for each storage technology within an archival system, and we explore the effect that prospective technological advancements and growth rates over time may have on the relative cost and viability of each storage technology for archival systems. We show that the lifecycle and upgrade cost of drives are significant cost factors for removable media archives. We observe that increasing performance requires adding more drives to an archival system, and the cost of each drive dominates the cost to increase performance. We compare trends in storage technologies to suggest developments that could minimize the long-term total cost of ownership for archival systems. We show that hard disks and flash could become cost-competitive with tape-based archives by adopting new designs to minimize infrastructure and electricity costs.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00011","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526869.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Simulation to Design Scalable and Cost-Efficient Archival Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Using Simulation to Design Scalable and Cost-Efficient Archival Storage Systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526869/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18249062","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526869/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Simulation to Design Scalable and Cost-Efficient Archival Storage Systems","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"688600a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103239S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526478","isNumber":"8526858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526478","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8526858","articleId":"8526869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526871,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Jadidi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Jadidi","id":"38277816100"},{"name":"Mahmut Kandemir","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mahmut","lastName":"Kandemir","id":"37275431900"},{"name":"Chita Das","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chita","lastName":"Das","id":"37268589600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1526-7539"}],"articleNumber":"8526871","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Random access memory","Resistance","Scalability","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","CMOS memory circuits","data compression","DRAM chips","memory architecture","phase change memories","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rank subsetting memory architecture","write disturbance problem","word-line","vulnerable cells","bit-line","adjacent memory lines","compressed memory line","read-intensive memory lines","write-intensive addresses","super dense PCM-based main memory","tolerating write disturbance","constant technology scaling","modern computing systems","thread-level parallelism","dense main memory subsystem","data-intensive workloads","dominant technology","power consumption problems","sub-micron scales","Phase Change Memory","reliability problems","cell size","low-overhead mechanisms","DRAM","computing systems","scalable memory subsystem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase Change Memory","Write Disturbance Error"]}],"abstract":"Constant technology scaling has enabled modern computing systems to achieve high degrees of thread-level parallelism, making the design of a highly scalable and dense main memory subsystem a major challenge, especially for data-intensive workloads. While during the past three decades DRAM has been widely used as the dominant technology to build main memory, it faces serious scalability and power consumption problems at sub-micron scales. Phase Change Memory (PCM) has been proposed as one of the most promising technologies to replace DRAM in future computing systems, because of its short access latency and high scalability. However, PCM has some reliability problems below 20nm technology. As the cell size scales down, the thermal-disturbance between the cells is exacerbated. More precisely, the generated heat during the write operation can disseminate to the adjacent cells and potentially change their values. This phenomenon is known as the write disturbance problem. In this work, we study the impact of write disturbance along the word-line and bit-line in a PCM-based main memory. We then propose two low-overhead mechanisms to address this problem in different dimensions. Our proposed schemes are based on a rank subsetting memory architecture where each chip can be accessed separately. To mitigate the write disturbance problem along the word-line, we use a combination of differential write (DW) and verify-and-correct (VnC) schemes only if the chance of having cascaded verification steps is low. Otherwise, we write into all the vulnerable cells within the target chip to avoid performance loss. To tolerate write disturbance along the bit-line, we use data compression to compact the data and place the adjacent memory lines in a non-overlapping fashion. We further use the extra space within a compressed memory line to store BCH code, in order to protect read-intensive memory lines against write-intensive addresses. Our proposed schemes guarantee reliable write operations in a super dense PCM-based main memory, and improve the system performance by 17% on average, compared to the state-of-the-art mechanism in this domain.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00013","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526871.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tolerating Write Disturbance Errors in PCM: Experimental Characterization, Analysis, and Mechanisms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Tolerating Write Disturbance Errors in PCM: Experimental Characterization, Analysis, and Mechanisms","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18232851","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526871/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tolerating Write Disturbance Errors in PCM: Experimental Characterization, Analysis, and Mechanisms","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"688600a053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10713S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526478","isNumber":"8526858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8526858","articleId":"8526871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8526873,"authors":[{"name":"Narges Shahidi","affiliation":["The Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA"],"firstName":"Narges","lastName":"Shahidi","id":"37604067500"},{"name":"Mahmut T.

However, some specific features they have such as erase-before-write and limited erase count make this transition more challenging. To tackle the issues brought by these features, Flash Translation Layer (FTL) leverages functionalities such as Garbage Collection (GC) to provide free space by erasing the blocks and cleaning the stale data. This process occupies SSD resources and causes extra waiting time for normal IO requests, and ultimately increases response time. Cloud workloads include many applications with small random write access patterns which cause frequent GC invocations. Flash occupation at the time of GC causes inconsistent performance and increases tail latency which may in turn violate SLA in these applications. In this paper, we modify the conventional GC process and propose a Cache-assisted Garbage Collection (CachedGC). CachedGC postpones writing back valid pages during the GC, erases the block at the first possible time, and hence resumes normal SSD operations sooner. CachedGC reduces request response time and tail latency by reducing the effective latency of GC.

Thus it is important to exploit the unprecedented power of leadership High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems for greater potential of deep learning. While much attention has been paid to leverage the latest processors and accelerators, I/O support also needs to keep up with the growth of computing power for deep neural networks. In this research, we introduce an entropy-aware I/O framework called DeepIO for large-scale deep learning on HPC systems. Its overarching goal is to coordinate the use of memory, communication, and I/O resources for efficient training of datasets. DeepIO features an I/O pipeline that utilizes several novel optimizations: RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)-assisted in-situ shuffling, input pipelining, and entropy-aware opportunistic ordering. In addition, we design a portable storage interface to support efficient I/O on any underlying storage system. We have implemented DeepIO as a prototype for the popular TensorFlow framework and evaluated it on a variety of different storage systems. Our evaluation shows that DeepIO delivers significantly better performance than existing memory-based storage systems.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00023","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526881.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526858","startPage":"145","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy-Aware I/O Pipelining for Large-Scale Deep Learning on HPC Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Entropy-Aware I/O Pipelining for Large-Scale Deep Learning on HPC Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526881/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232852","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526881/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy-Aware I/O Pipelining for Large-Scale Deep Learning on HPC Systems","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"688600a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075669S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526478","isNumber":"8526858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526478","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8526858","articleId":"8526881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8526883,"authors":[{"name":"Mackenzie Haffey","affiliation":["University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Mackenzie","lastName":"Haffey","id":"37086517609"},{"name":"Martin Arlitt","affiliation":["University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Arlitt","id":"37297477600"},{"name":"Carey Williamson","affiliation":["University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Carey","lastName":"Williamson","id":"37276124700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1526-7539"}],"articleNumber":"8526883","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Time series analysis","Image edge detection","Correlation","Reactive power","Analytical models","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet","invasive software","peer-to-peer computing","protocols","SQL","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network services","campus edge networks","periodic traffic detection","Bro connection logs","P2P detection","classication taxonomy","periodic network communications","botnet traffic flows","periodic traffic analysis","campus edge network","flexible SQL-based approach","simple SQL-based approach","Network Time Protocol","periodic network traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Periodic traffic","workload characterization","Network traffic measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526883","abstract":"Traffic in today's edge networks is diverse, exhibiting many different patterns.

These systems adopt slab-based space management on flash and provide a low-cost solution for key-value caching. However, optimizing cache efficiency for flash-based key-value cache systems is highly challenging, due to the huge number of key-value items and the unique technical constraints of flash devices. In this paper, we present a dynamic on-line compression scheme, called SlimCache, to improve the cache hit ratio by virtually expanding the usable cache space through data compression. We have investigated the effect of compression granularity to achieve a balance between compression ratio and speed, and leveraged the unique workload characteristics in key-value systems to efficiently identify and separate hot and cold data. In order to dynamically adapt to workload changes during runtime, we have designed an adaptive hot/cold area partitioning method based on a cost model. Inorder to avoid unnecessary compression, SlimCache also estimates data compressibility to determine whether the data are suitable for compression or not. We have implemented a prototype based on Twitter's Fatcache. Our experimental results show that SlimCache can accommodate more key-value items in flash by up to 125.9%, effectively increasing throughput and reducing average latency by up to 255.6% and 78.9%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00029","startPage":"209","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526887.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SlimCache: Exploiting Data Compression Opportunities in Flash-Based Key-Value Caching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526887/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"SlimCache: Exploiting Data Compression Opportunities in Flash-Based Key-Value Caching","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18232849","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526887/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SlimCache: Exploiting Data Compression Opportunities in Flash-Based Key-Value Caching","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"688600a209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08827S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526478","isNumber":"8526858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8526858","articleId":"8526887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526889,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Aussel","affiliation":["SAMOVAR, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Aussel","id":"37086276169"},{"name":"Yohan Petetin","affiliation":["SAMOVAR, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, France"],"firstName":"Yohan","lastName":"Petetin","id":"38474722600"},{"name":"Sophie Chabridon","affiliation":["SAMOVAR, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, France"],"firstName":"Sophie","lastName":"Chabridon","id":"37342871200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1526-7539"}],"articleNumber":"8526889","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":679},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Data mining","Natural language processing","Computational modeling","Vocabulary","Transforms","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","grammars","natural language processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["log messages","failure prediction","log mining techniques","anomaly prediction","NLP-based log parsing","industrial systems","data mining approaches","industrial aeronautical system","raw unstructured text","natural language processing","HDFS cluster"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine Learning","Failure Prediction","Data Mining","Natural Language Processing","Log Parsing"]}],"abstract":"Failure prediction of industrial systems is a promising application domain for data mining approaches and should naturally rely on log messages which are a prime source of data as they are generated by many systems. However, before extracting relevant information of such log messages, another critical step is to parse the logs, that is to say to transform a raw unstructured text from the log messages into a suitable input for data mining. These two problems (log parsing then log mining) are often studied separately while they are directly related in the context of failure prediction; moreover, few performance benchmarks are publicly available. In this paper, we focus on the impact of log parsing techniques via natural language processing on the performances of log mining on two datasets. The first one is a log of an industrial aeronautical system comprising over 4,500,000 messages collected over one year of operation; the second one is a public benchmark set from an HDFS cluster. On the latter, we show that it is possible to raise the F-score from 96% to 99.2% while using simpler and more robust log parsing techniques that require less parameter tuning provided that they are correctly combined with log mining techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Performances of Log Mining for Anomaly Prediction Through NLP-Based Log Parsing","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00031","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526889.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Improving Performances of Log Mining for Anomaly Prediction Through NLP-Based Log Parsing","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8526889/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232842","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Performances of Log Mining for Anomaly Prediction Through NLP-Based Log Parsing","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"688600a237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075593S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526478","isNumber":"8526858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526478","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8526858","articleId":"8526889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8526892,"authors":[{"name":"Parth Thakkar","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Trichy, India"],"firstName":"Parth","lastName":"Thakkar","id":"37086517706"},{"name":"Senthil Nathan","affiliation":["IBM Res.

Hyperledger Fabric is one such permissioned blockchain platform and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation. The Fabric comprises various components such as smart-contracts, endorsers, committers, validators, and orderers. As the performance of blockchain platform is a major concern for enterprise applications, in this work, we perform a comprehensive empirical study to characterize the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and identify potential performance bottlenecks to gain a better understanding of the system. We follow a two-phased approach. In the first phase, our goal is to understand the impact of various configuration parameters such as block size, endorsement policy, channels, resource allocation, state database choice on the transaction throughput & latency to provide various guidelines on configuring these parameters. In addition, we also aim to identify performance bottlenecks and hotspots. We observed that (1) endorsement policy verification, (2) sequential policy validation of transactions in a block, and (3) state validation and commit (with CouchDB) were the three major bottlenecks. In the second phase, we focus on optimizing Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 based on our observations. We introduced and studied various simple optimizations such as aggressive caching for endorsement policy verification in the cryptography component (3x improvement in the performance) and parallelizing endorsement policy verification (7x improvement). Further, we enhanced and measured the effect of an existing bulk read/write optimization for CouchDB during state validation & commit phase (2.5x improvement). By combining all three optimizations1, we improved the overall throughput by 16x (i.e., from 140 tps to 2250 tps).","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00034","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526892.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Benchmarking and Optimizing Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Performance Benchmarking and Optimizing Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Platform","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526892/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18232832","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526892/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Benchmarking and Optimizing Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Platform","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"688600a264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09426S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526478","isNumber":"8526858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526478","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"8526858","articleId":"8526892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8526893,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolas Ioannou","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich"],"firstName":"Nikolas","lastName":"Ioannou","id":"37393013400"},{"name":"Kornilios Kourtis","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich"],"firstName":"Kornilios","lastName":"Kourtis","id":"37393238300"},{"name":"Ioannis Koltsidas","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Koltsidas","id":"37394157800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1526-7539"}],"articleNumber":"8526893","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Magnetic recording","Software","Drives","Flash memories","Media","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","input-output programs","optimisation","storage management","video servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commodity storage","SALSA host translation layer","multiple storage technologies","random access","device translation layers","multiple devices","durability","storage devices","multidevice optimizations","storage demands","SALSA design","MySQL","Swift object store","video server"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data storage systems","Flash memories","Nonvolatile memory","Hard disks","System software"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526893","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526893.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00035","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2018.00035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526858","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elevating Commodity Storage with the SALSA Host Translation Layer","abstract":"To satisfy increasing storage demands in both capacity and performance, industry has turned to multiple storage technologies, including Flash SSDs and SMR disks. These devices employ a translation layer that conceals the idiosyncrasies of their mediums and enables random access. Device translation layers are, however, inherently constrained: resources on the drive are scarce, they cannot be adapted to application requirements, and lack visibility across multiple devices. As a result, performance and durability of many storage devices is severely degraded. In this paper, we present SALSA: a translation layer that executes on the host and allows unmodified applications to better utilize commodity storage. SALSA supports a wide range of single-and multi-device optimizations and, because is implemented in software, can adapt to specific workloads. We describe SALSA's design, and demonstrate its significant benefits using microbenchmarks and case studies based on three applications: MySQL, the Swift object store, and a video server.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8526893/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18232831","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8526893/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Elevating Commodity Storage with the SALSA Host Translation Layer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elevating Commodity Storage with the SALSA Host Translation Layer","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"688600a277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.293299S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526478","isNumber":"8526858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8526858","articleId":"8526893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8526984,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Tainan University of Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37065518100"},{"name":"Jen-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37311438700"},{"name":"Siou-Cyuan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Siou-Cyuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086509760"},{"name":"Ching-Chuan Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chuan","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37085868505"},{"name":"Chia-Ming Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Ming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086510090"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5214-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5213-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5215-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"8526984","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Training","Wireless communication","Global Positioning System","Base stations","Satellites","Adaptive learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cellular radio","computational complexity","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","neural nets","precision engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement devices","inverse matrix","gradient descent adaptive learning rate training algorithm","input/output mapping","approximation results","geometric dilution of precision","mobile station positioning","precision approximation","adaptive neural network learning","GDOP","GDOP approximation error","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Geometric dilution of precision (GDOP)","Artificial neural network (ANN)","Gradient descent adaptive learning rate algorithm (GDA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526984","abstract":"The geometric dilution of precision is widely used as criterion for selecting the best set of the measurement devices. Some methods had been proposed to rmd the value of the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP), such as using inverse matrix to solve the linear equation. But it takes a large amount of computing time to find the optimal solution. In this paper, we propose to adopt a neural network with gradient descent adaptive learning rate training algorithm to approximate the value of GDOP. The proposed two types of input/output mapping used the element in the matrix as the input data of the neural network. After finishing the training process, it can get a better approximation results with the proposed two types. The simulation result shows that proposed algorithm has lower GDOP approximation error using less Epochs than the other types. For cellular wireless communication system, it will significantly reduce the computational complexity and the training time by selecting the service base station at first with three other base stations to estimate the position of mobile station.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2018.8526984","startPage":"474","endPage":"479","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and

However, most of the current studies are based on those popular languages such as Chinese and English, and there is a little research on minority languages. To this end, the speech parameter generation and emotional speech synthesis for Malay are studied in this paper. We first used recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the features of dependencies in Malay, and the parametric model was established through multivariate feature matrices for Malay texts using long short-term (LSTM). Most of the inputs are audio and corresponding triphone models which are obtained after a series of segmentation in the process of speech synthesis. There are few emotional components remained in the segmented results. This paper used LSTM RNN to directly model on the waveform of Malay speech and to keep emotions as much as possible. Experimental results on real-life data showed that the synthesis of Malay speech parameter based on LSTM RNN model achieved satisfying performance which are 1.16 and 0.25 improvements in two indexes respectively and applying that model in Malay emotional speech synthesis reached the precision of 85.46%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research On Synthesis Of Speech Parameter And Emotional Speech For Malay Language Using LSTM RNN","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2018.8527008","startPage":"598","endPage":"603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2018.8527008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526922","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501632/8526922/08527008.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 July 2018","displayDocTitle":"Research On Synthesis Of Speech Parameter And Emotional Speech For Malay Language Using LSTM RNN","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8527008/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18232948","conferenceDate":"15-18 July 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research On Synthesis Of Speech Parameter And Emotional Speech For Malay Language Using LSTM RNN","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0598_4044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05612S","chronDate":"15-18 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501632","isNumber":"8526922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501632","xplore-issue":"8526922","articleId":"8527008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8527012,"authors":[{"name":"MEI-PING SONG","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"MEI-PING","lastName":"SONG","id":"37278155200"},{"name":"YUE-JING CAO","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"YUE-JING","lastName":"CAO","id":"37086510529"},{"name":"CHUN-YAN YU","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"CHUN-YAN","lastName":"YU","id":"37086099864"},{"name":"JU-BAI AN","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"JU-BAI","lastName":"AN","id":"37086486000"},{"name":"CHEIN-I CHANG","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, USA"],"firstName":"CHEIN-I","lastName":"CHANG","id":"37086485543"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5214-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5213-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5215-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"8527012","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image matching","Approximation algorithms","Feature extraction","Filtering algorithms","Lighting","Brightness","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","electronic engineering computing","feature extraction","image filtering","image matching","nonlinear filters","solar cells","solar power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-pixel precision","repeated shooting solar image recognition","eigenvector","hamming distance initial matching","image point coordinates","numerical solution","AKAZE-FREAK","RANSAC algorithm","image feature point matching accuracy","SURF-FREAK","SIFT-FREAK","error matching point","FREAK descriptors","feature points","fast display diffusion","nonlinear diffusion filter","image pyramid","single feature point matching strategy","improved freak algorithm","solar image matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature point matching","AKAZE","FREAK","Improvement FREAK"]}],"abstract":"FREAK algorithm has the defects of not having scale invariance and single feature point matching strategy, being prone to unsatisfactory results. Based on AKAZE and RANSAC algorithm, an improved FREAK algorithm is proposed, named AKAZE-FREAK. The image pyramid was constructed by using the nonlinear diffusion filter and the numerical solution was obtained by fast display diffusion (FED) to obtain the image point coordinates with sub-pixel precision. Then the feature points were described by the FREAK descriptors to distribute directions for the feature points. Finally, based on the initial matching of the hamming distance to the eigen vector, RANSAC is used to eliminate the error matching point. In this paper, this algorithm is applied to the recognition of repeated shooting solar images. After the improved algorithm is compared with the SIFT-FREAK, SURF-FREAK and FREAK algorithms, it shows an improvement in the image feature point matching accuracy with good robustness on the scale difference, illumination difference and rotation difference of the image. It also improves the accuracy of the judgement of the late repeat.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2018.8527012","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501632/8526918/08527012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2018.8527012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8526918","startPage":"126","endPage":"131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solar Image Matching Based on Improved Freak Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Solar Image Matching Based on Improved Freak Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 July 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527012/","conferenceDate":"15-18 July 2018","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18249134","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8527012/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solar Image Matching Based on Improved Freak Algorithm","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0126_2088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058331S","chronDate":"15-18 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501632","isNumber":"8526918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501632","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8526918","articleId":"8527012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8527031,"authors":[{"name":"WEI-FENG WANG","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Army Academy of Armored Forces, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"WEI-FENG","lastName":"WANG","id":"37086513397"},{"name":"XUE-HUAN QIU","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Army Academy of Armored Forces, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"XUE-HUAN","lastName":"QIU","id":"37086508848"},{"name":"CAI-SEN CHEN","affiliation":["Department of Training Center, Army Academy of Armored Forces, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"CAI-SEN","lastName":"CHEN","id":"37087319764"},{"name":"BO LIN","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Army Academy of Armored Forces, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"BO","lastName":"LIN","id":"37086510734"},{"name":"HUI-MIN ZHANG","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Army Academy of Armored Forces, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"HUI-MIN","lastName":"ZHANG","id":"37086512606"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5214-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5213-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5215-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"8527031","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Training","Data models","Neurons","Logic gates","Biological neural networks","Gears"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","fault diagnosis","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden layer neurons","convolutional neural network","recurrent neural network","LSTM method","short-term memory network","fault identification","fault diagnosis method","long short-term memory neural network","support vector machine","SVM","CNN","RNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","fault diagnosis","lSTM neural network","machine learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527031","abstract":"In order to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis and accelerate the speed of fault identification, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, and constructs its architecture and model framework.

Therefore, designing an optimal heuristic function becomes the primary goal of developing a search algorithm for specific domains in artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to design a well-constructed heuristic function without careful consideration and trial-and-error, especially for complex pathfinding problems. The complexity of a heuristic function increases and becomes unmanageable to design when an increasing number of parameters are involved. Existing approaches often avoids complex heuristic function design: they either trade-off the accuracy for faster computation or taking advantage of the parallelism for better performance. The objective of this paper is to reduce the difficulty of complex heuristic function design for A* search algorithm. We aim to design an algorithm that can be automatically optimized to achieve rapid search with high accuracy and low computational cost. In this paper, we present a novel design and optimization method for a Multi-Weighted-Heuristics function (MWH) named Evolutionary Heuristic A* search (EHA*) to: 1) minimize the effort on heuristic function design via Genetic Algorithm (GA), 2) optimize the performance of A* search and its variants including but not limited to WA* and MHA*, and 3) guarantee the completeness and optimality. EHA* algorithm enables high performance searches and significantly simplifies the processing of heuristic design. We apply EHA* to two classic AI search problems: the Blocks World and the Sliding Tile Puzzle.

In particular, some recent applications such as robot navigation, self-driving drones/vehicles, and construction robotics need three-dimensional high-definition maps within cm-level accuracy to make a decision of action by themselves. These maps are based on point cloud data from three-dimensional surveys of geographic features on the Earth by laser scanning and photogrammetry. Point clouds provide a flexible and accurate geometric information for reconstructing 3D shapes of not only indoor but also outdoor features. However, it expends time on creating a map due to many manual operations of processing. In this paper, we design an interoperable framework of semantic annotation for point cloud data. Semantic annotation of point cloud is the process of attaching conceptual label information such as cars, buildings, desks, or people to each point in a set of data. This process takes first priority to create training data set for machine learning and deep learning tasks. An efficient annotation tool for 3D point cloud data is crucial to improve the quality of deep learning models and getting better results in deep learning would be helpful to reduce the manual processing. Even though there are already a number of tools, they are usually standalone and tightly coupled systems. This is likely to lead to a problem of limited interoperability of data and process between systems. This paper introduces a resource-oriented design for the annotation framework of point cloud data on the Web with the ability of quick adaptation of various machine learning techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8527352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIKE.2018.00052","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE First International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (AIKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE First International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (AIKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8526512/8527352/08527484.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"233","doi":"10.1109/AIKE.2018.00052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Resource-Oriented Framework for Point Cloud Semantic Annotation with Deep Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Resource-Oriented Framework for Point Cloud Semantic Annotation with Deep Learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8527484/","publicationDate":"Sep 2018","accessionNumber":"18232875","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527484/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Resource-Oriented Framework for Point Cloud Semantic Annotation with Deep Learning","confLoc":"Laguna Hills, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"955500a228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072302S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8526512","isNumber":"8527352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8526512","xplore-issue":"8527352","articleId":"8527484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8527497,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Burwood, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8527497/choi-2880159-small.gif","p":["Jinho Choi (SM\u201902) was born in Seoul, South Korea.

To analyze the access delay of multichannel ALOHA with fast retrial, we employ an erasure channel model, which is equivalent to the widely used collision model, and study the effective capacity and the quality of service (QoS) exponent. Through the asymptotic analysis, we show that the QoS exponent grows logarithmically with the system dimension (i.e., the number of subchannels), which implies that multichannel ALOHA with fast retrial can effectively shorten the average access delay by increasing the system dimension. However, the growth rate of the effective capacity is shown to be slower than linear when the system dimension increases, which becomes the cost of improved access delay. In particular, the effective capacity is proportional to (N/ lnN), where N is the number of subchannels. From the QoS exponent, the tail probability of queue is obtained and compared with simulation results, which confirms that the theoretical results from the derived QoS agree with the simulation results for large systems.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2880159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2880159","startPage":"3175","endPage":"3185","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8709863/08527497.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8709863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Latency Multichannel ALOHA With Fast Retrial for Machine-Type Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"Low-Latency Multichannel ALOHA With Fast Retrial for Machine-Type Communications","publicationDate":"April 2019","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8527497/","accessionNumber":"18654030","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527497/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Latency Multichannel ALOHA With Fast Retrial for Machine-Type Communications","sourcePdf":"jiot-choi-2880159-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117314S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8527497","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8527518,"authors":[{"name":"William J.

Recent technological developments point toward the possibility of implanting sensors inside the body, thus enabling in-situ data gathering and real-time actuation with the transmission of the sensed data to other implants as well as external computational clouds. This paper aims to survey and compare the existing methods for achieving intra-body communication (IBC) covering the methods of galvanic coupling (waveguide-based), capacitive coupling (electric field-based), ultrasound (acoustic-based) and magnetic resonant coupling (magnetic field-based). The performance of each method is evaluated in terms of its physical layer characteristics, including operating frequency range, attenuation effects within the body, channel modeling methods, power consumption, achievable data rates, communication distance, and safety limits under prolonged signal exposure. Based on this metric-driven study, we identify specific scenarios where one or more of these different IBC methods are better suited. For the specific case of galvanic coupling, we provide select system designs, experimental results from a custom-designed testbed and target applications that are more appropriate for this method of IBC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that encapsulates the state of the art and current research trends for several different types of IBC solutions, a topic that promises to revolutionize the future of healthcare.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2018.2879643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8727625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8727625/08527518.pdf","endPage":"1164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Survey of Galvanic Coupling and Alternative Intra-Body Communication Technologies","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2018.2879643","startPage":"1145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527518","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9739/8727625/8527518-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Survey of Galvanic Coupling and Alternative Intra-Body Communication Technologies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527518/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18726271","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8527518/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1453384"},{"fundingName":"Draper Laboratory Fellowship Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Comprehensive Survey of Galvanic Coupling and Alternative Intra-Body Communication Technologies","sourcePdf":"comst-tomlinson-2879643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.236494S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8727625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8727625","articleId":"8527518","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8527520,"authors":[{"name":"Zijun Gong","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8584171/8527520/gong-2880232-small.gif","p":["Zijun Gong received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

Therefore, massive MIMO systems are generally assumed to work in low SNR regime. However, channel estimates are contaminated by white noise in practical scenarios, which will induce great performance degradation, especially in low SNR regime. To improve channel estimation quality, we propose a channel estimator to filter out noise in the conventional matched filter-based channel estimates by exploring the spatial sparsity of massive MIMO signals. The viability of this new method is based on the fact that wireless channels are sparse in space domain. To be specific, most energy of the desired signals concentrates on a small number of paths (or directions, equivalently), while the energy of noise is equally spread on all directions. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to identify the desired signals and eliminate most noise. One of the largest advantages of the proposed algorithm is that statistical information concerning the channel vectors is unnecessary. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results justify the efficacy of the proposed channel estimator.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8584171/08527520.pdf","startPage":"883","endPage":"893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2018.2880232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2018.2880232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for Sparse Massive MIMO Channels in Low SNR Regime","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO communication","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparsity","massive MIMO","channel estimation","low SNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for Sparse Massive MIMO Channels in Low SNR Regime","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8527520/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2018-03792"},{"fundingName":"InnovateNL SensorTECH","grantNumber":"5404-2061-101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for Sparse Massive MIMO Channels in Low SNR Regime","sourcePdf":"tccn-li-2880232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112817S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8584171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8584171","articleId":"8527520","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527522,"authors":[{"name":"Konpal Ali","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Divison, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Konpal","lastName":"Ali","orcid":"0000-0002-2741-8330","id":"37085708651"},{"name":"Hesham Elsawy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"Elsawy","orcid":"0000-0003-4201-6126","id":"38523664000"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Divison, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","orcid":"0000-0003-4827-1793","id":"37274291900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8527522","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Silicon carbide","Downlink","Interference","Decoding","Fading channels","STEM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cellular radio","multi-access systems","statistical distributions","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["meta distribution","downlink nonorthogonal multiple access","MD","coverage probability","downlink nonorthogonal-multiple-access networks","NOMA users","beta distribution","closed-form moments","approximate moments","cell-center users","Poisson networks","downlink NOMA networks","integral calculation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stochastic geometry","meta distribution","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527522","abstract":"We study the meta distribution (MD) of the coverage probability (CP) in downlink non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) networks.

However, modern Internet of Things applications, such as augmented reality and real-time monitoring, bring stringent delay requirements to the computation tasks in the device-to-computing-facility communications. To better accommodate the delay requirements of the computation tasks, the recently proposed fog computing architecture suggests that these computation tasks can be extensively offloaded to the distributed computation facilities along the cloud-to-things continuum. These computation facilities, including central clouds and the computation facilities standing at the network edge, jointly form an overlay network, named a fog network, to provide fog computing services for end devices. This paper targets a practical and efficient scheme to schedule tasks with heterogeneous delay sensitivities in a shared fog network. A mathematical model is first constructed to capture the major characteristics of a fog network. The model enforces lexicographic max\u2013min fairness, an enhanced metric compared to conventional max\u2013min fairness. The task offloading problem is modeled as an integer nonlinear program. An efficient and exact solution method is proposed based on problem-specific analysis. Finally, synthesized-trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed offloading scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8614370/08527523.pdf","startPage":"4945","endPage":"4956","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2880250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2880250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8614370","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Aware Task Offloading in Shared Fog Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Delays","Cloud computing","Edge computing","Mathematical model","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fog computing","optimization","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Aware Task Offloading in Shared Fog Networks","volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8527523/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Aware Task Offloading in Shared Fog Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-jiang-2880250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097987S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8614370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8614370","articleId":"8527523","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527524,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8629373/8527524/wang-2877172-small.gif","p":["Luke Wang (S\u201918) received the B.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2011, and the M.A.Sc. degree from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree, with a focus on optimizing reconfigurable analog-to-digital converters for wireline applications.","In 2013, he joined Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA, as an Intern, working on a 28-nm SerDes project.

In this letter, we investigated the mapping of subsurface electrical resistivity distributions from electromagnetic (EM) data with CNNs. To begin imaging electrical resistivity using CNNs, we carried out precise delineation of a subsurface salt structure, which is indispensable for identification of offshore hydrocarbon reservoirs, using towed streamer EM data. For training the CNN model, an electrical resistivity model, including a salt body, and corresponding EM data calculated through numerical modeling were used as the label and input, respectively. The optimal weights and biases of the CNN were obtained minimizing the mean-square error between the predicted resistivity distribution and the target label. The final CNN model was selected using a validation data set during training. After training, we applied the trained CNN to test data sets of noisy data and simulated-SEAM data, which were not provided to the network during training. The test results demonstrate that our trained CNN model is stable, reliable, and efficient, and indicate the possibility of successful application of our CNN model to field data.

This information can be retrieved from network traffic traces, network alarms, signal quality indicators, users' behavioral data, etc. Advanced mathematical tools are required to extract meaningful information from these data and take decisions pertaining to the proper functioning of the networks from the network-generated data. Among these mathematical tools, machine learning (ML) is regarded as one of the most promising methodological approaches to perform network-data analysis and enable automated network self-configuration and fault management. The adoption of ML techniques in the field of optical communication networks is motivated by the unprecedented growth of network complexity faced by optical networks in the last few years. Such complexity increase is due to the introduction of a huge number of adjustable and interdependent system parameters (e.g., routing configurations, modulation format, symbol rate, coding schemes, etc.) that are enabled by the usage of coherent transmission/reception technologies, advanced digital signal processing, and compensation of nonlinear effects in optical fiber propagation. In this paper we provide an overview of the application of ML to optical communications and networking.

It employs vehicular nodes connected to other smart objects equipped with a powerful multisensor platform, communication technologies, and IP-based connectivity to the Internet, thereby creating a possible social network called Social IoV (SIoV). Ensuring the required trustiness among communicating entities is an important task in such heterogeneous networks, especially for safety-related applications. Thus, in addition to securing intervehicle communication, the driver/passengers honesty factor must also be considered, since they could tamper the system in order to provoke unwanted situations. To bridge the gaps between these two paradigms, we envision to connect SIoV and online social networks (OSNs) for the purpose of estimating the drivers and passengers honesty based on their OSN profiles. Furthermore, we compare the current location of the vehicles with their estimated path based on their historical mobility profile. We combine SIoV, path-based and OSN-based trusts to compute the overall trust for different vehicles and their current users. As a result, we propose a trust-aware communication architecture for social IoV (TACASHI). TACASHI offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and intervehicle communication architecture for SIoV considering also the drivers honesty factor based on OSN. Extensive simulation results evidence the efficiency of our proposal, ensuring high detection ratios >87% and high accuracy with reduced error ratios, clearly outperforming previous proposals, known as RTM and AD-IoV.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527532/","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8527532/","accessionNumber":"18869302","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"TACASHI: Trust-Aware Communication Architecture for Social Internet of Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TACASHI: Trust-Aware Communication Architecture for Social Internet of Vehicles","sourcePdf":"jiot-ahmed-2880332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118868S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8784345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8784345","articleId":"8527532","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8527533,"authors":[{"name":"Hyoukjun Kwon,","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Hyoukjun Kwon is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at School of Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.

Most DNN accelerators are optimized for regular mapping of the problems, or dataflows, emanating from dense matrix multiplications in convolutional layers. However, continuous innovations in DNN including myriad layer types/shapes, cross-layer fusion, and sparsity have led to irregular dataflows within accelerators, which introduces severe PE underutilization because of rigid and tightly coupled connections among PEs and buffers. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a communication-centric approach called MAERI for designing DNN accelerators. MAERI's key novelty is a light-weight configurable interconnect connecting all compute and memory elements that enable efficient mapping of both regular and irregular dataflows providing near 100% PE utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2018","volume":"38","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2018","publicationDate":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8527533/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Communication-Centric Approach for Designing Flexible DNN Accelerators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Communication-Centric Approach for Designing Flexible DNN Accelerators","sourcePdf":"mm-kwon-2877289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041374S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"40","isNumber":"8584166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8584166","articleId":"8527533","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527536,"authors":[{"name":"Axelle Pochet","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Axelle","lastName":"Pochet","orcid":"0000-0002-6684-8552","id":"37086697179"},{"name":"Pedro H.

Despite the many tools developed in the past decades, automation of this task remains a challenge. We investigate the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to seismic fault detection. CNN is a deep learning method growing in interest in the computer vision community, due to its high performances in a great variety of object detection tasks. One of the constraints of this method is the need to provide a massive number of interpreted data, a requirement particularly difficult to attend in the seismic area. To this end, we built a synthetic data set with simple fault geometries. The input of our network is the seismic amplitude only; the method does not require computing any seismic attribute. We apply a strategy of patch classification along the images, which requires a simple postprocess to extract the exact fault location. Our network shows good results on synthetic data and encouraging results when tested on regions of a real section of The Netherland offshore F3 block in the North Sea.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seismic Fault Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks Trained on Synthetic Poststacked Amplitude Maps","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2018.2875836","startPage":"352","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2018.2875836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8653434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/8653434/08527536.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Seismic Fault Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks Trained on Synthetic Poststacked Amplitude Maps","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8527536/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18489575","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shell Brazil through the \u201cCoupled Geomechanics\u201d project at Tecgraf Institute (PUC-Rio)"},{"fundingName":"ANP \u201cCompromisso com Investimentos em Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento\u201d through the Research and Development Levy Regulation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seismic Fault Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks Trained on Synthetic Poststacked Amplitude Maps","sourcePdf":"lgrs-pochet-2875836-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056001S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8653434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8653434","articleId":"8527536","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527537,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Shahini","affiliation":["Advanced Networking Laboratory, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8527537/shahi-2880190-small.gif","p":["Ali Shahini (S\u201911) received the M.S. degree (with distinction) in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.","His current research interests include Internet of Things, network optimization, resource allocation, machine learning, and green communications."]},"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Shahini","orcid":"0000-0001-9586-7966","id":"37085700866"},{"name":"Abbas Kiani","affiliation":["Advanced Networking Laboratory, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8527537/kiani-2880190-small.gif","p":["Abbas Kiani (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from Shahed University, Tehran, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.","He is currently with AT&T, Dallas, TX, USA.

More importantly, we design an optimization framework that captures a fundamental tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency of the network. In particular, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem that maximizes EE while taking into consideration of user buffer occupancy, data rate fairness, energy causality constraints, and interference constraints. We further prove that the proposed optimization framework is an NP-hard problem. Thus, we propose a low complexity heuristic algorithm, to solve the resource allocation and energy harvesting optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is shown to be capable of achieving near optimal solution with high accuracy while having polynomial complexity.

In the first-stage 5b SAR ADC, the switching power consumption is significantly reduced due to the switching operation by only a separate digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with a small unit capacitance, which generates the comparator decision threshold. When this setup is applied to an actual system, the reference voltage driver of the system is less burdened. Furthermore, the SAR ADC employs a custom-encapsulated capacitor to improve the limited linearity of a DAC caused by parasitic capacitance. A residue amplifier employs an ultra-low power ring amplifier structure. The amplifier is shared by each channel to reduce not only the power consumption and die area but also channel mismatches. The prototype ADC in a 28-nm CMOS process demonstrates a measured differential non-linearity and integral non-linearity within 1.50 LSB and 2.85 LSB at 12b, respectively, with a maximum signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio and a spurious-free dynamic range of 58.0 dB and 73.7 dB at 140 MS/s, respectively. The ADC occupies an active die area of 0.202 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and consumes 1.1 mW at a 0.8-V supply voltage, corresponding to a figure of merit of 12.1 fJ/conversion-step.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2880288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2880288","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8746742/08527538.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8746742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12.1 fJ/Conv.-Step 12b 140 MS/s 28-nm CMOS Pipelined SAR ADC Based on Energy-Efficient Switching and Shared Ring Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A 12.1 fJ/Conv.-Step 12b 140 MS/s 28-nm CMOS Pipelined SAR ADC Based on Energy-Efficient Switching and Shared Ring Amplifier","volume":"66","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2019","accessionNumber":"18777138","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8527538/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007107","fundingName":"KAIST"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003052","fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy","grantNumber":"10080488"},{"fundingName":"MSIT through the ITRC Program"},{"fundingName":"IITP","grantNumber":"IITP-2018-0-01421"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12.1 fJ/Conv.-Step 12b 140 MS/s 28-nm CMOS Pipelined SAR ADC Based on Energy-Efficient Switching and Shared Ring Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tcsii-ahn-2880288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058531S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8746742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8746742","articleId":"8527538","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8527539,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Kumar Jain","affiliation":["Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"],"bio":{"p":["Abhishek Kumar Jain is a Postdoctoral Research Staff Member with the Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, USA.

These challenges stem from the nature of the video content itself, the stochastic nature of wireless links as well as the intermittent availability of the licensed primary channels. Motivated by the above, this paper follows a different approach to tackle such a problem. Specifically, the proposed approach relies on obtaining an exact closed-form expression for the statistical distribution of the total amount of data that can be transmitted over the available primary users' channels for any arbitrary interval of time. The validity of the obtained expression is verified through a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. We then use this expression to propose a simple low complexity stochastic-based rate control approach for video streaming over cognitive radio networks. Due to its low computational complexity, the proposed approach can be easily implemented by any base station. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using the SimEvents simulator through reporting the average buffer occupancy, the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the inter-starvation interval. These metrics were reported for different parameters settings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2019","accessionNumber":"18505293","htmlLink":"/document/8527542/","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic-Based Rate Control Approach for Video Streaming Over Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002724","fundingName":"American University of Sharjah","grantNumber":"FRG16-R-23"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic-Based Rate Control Approach for Video Streaming Over Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tccn-hassan-2880228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090278S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8662263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","xplore-issue":"8662263","articleId":"8527542","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8527543,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-2541-6283","id":"38240992500"},{"name":"Wen-De Zhong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wen-De","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085417739"},{"name":"Helin Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Helin","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-9697-7470","id":"38575827800"},{"name":"Pengfei Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Du","orcid":"0000-0002-1096-8125","id":"37086047498"},{"name":"Yanbing Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yanbing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086032378"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8527543","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":781},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Silicon carbide","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bit rate","Downlink","Resource management","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","error statistics","free-space optical communication","light propagation","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective power allocation ratio range","UCD-based NOMA","CPC-based NOMA","successive interference cancellation-based nonorthogonal multiple access","conventional superposition coding-based nonorthogonal multiple access","bit error rate performance","VLC experiments","flexible-rate multiple access","NOMA-based VLC systems","uneven constellation demapping","downlink VLC systems","flexible-rate SIC-free NOMA technique","error propagation effect","visible light communication systems","constellation partitioning coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication","non-orthogonal multiple access","constellation partitioning coding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527543","abstract":"Visible light communication (VLC) systems utilizing conventional superposition coding/successive interference cancellation (SPC/SIC)-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) suffer from the error propagation effect due to imperfect SIC.

Moreover, by selecting a proper bit allocation scheme, flexible-rate multiple access can be supported in the VLC system applying CPC/UCD-based NOMA. Proof-of-concept two-user VLC experiments verify that, compared with conventional SPC/SIC-based NOMA, the bit error rate performance of the near user can be greatly improved by using CPC/UCD-based NOMA, and hence the effective power allocation ratio range can be substantially extended.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8685245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8685245/08527543.pdf","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2018.2879924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2018.2879924","startPage":"568","endPage":"571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible-Rate SIC-Free NOMA for Downlink VLC Based on Constellation Partitioning Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527543/","displayDocTitle":"Flexible-Rate SIC-Free NOMA for Downlink VLC Based on Constellation Partitioning Coding","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8527543/","volume":"8","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18598677","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002465","fundingName":"Delta"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible-Rate SIC-Free NOMA for Downlink VLC Based on Constellation Partitioning Coding","sourcePdf":"lwc-chen-2879924-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065768S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8685245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8685245","articleId":"8527543","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":8527544,"authors":[{"name":"Youngchul Kwak","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngchul","lastName":"Kwak","orcid":"0000-0002-5161-311X","id":"37086803619"},{"name":"Woo-Jin Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Jin","lastName":"Song","orcid":"0000-0002-9780-7980","id":"37363530500"},{"name":"Seong-Eun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Control Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Eun","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0002-4518-4208","id":"37404970000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"8527544","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1013},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Synthetic aperture radar","Target recognition","Training","Feature extraction","Exponential distribution","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","radar imaging","radar target recognition","remote sensing by radar","speckle","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR image despeckling","CNN training","SAR target recognition","stationary target acquisition","recognition database","speckle-noise-invariant convolutional neural network","synthetic aperture radar images","target recognition performance","convolutional neural networks","speckle-noise-invariant CNN","feature extraction","Lee sigma filter","despeckled images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network (CNN)","data augmentation","feature extraction","regularization","speckle noise","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2018.2877599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/8673667/08527544.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8673667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2018.2877599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speckle-Noise-Invariant Convolutional Neural Network for SAR Target Recognition","abstract":"Speckle noise is inherent to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and degrades the target recognition performance. Deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been widely applied for SAR target recognition, but the extracted features are still sensitive to speckle noise. In addition, speckle noise has been seldom considered in such CNN-based approaches. In this letter, we propose a speckle-noise-invariant CNN that employs regularization for minimizing feature variations caused by this noise. Before CNN training, we performed SAR image despeckling using the improved Lee sigma filter for feature extraction. Then, we generated SAR images for CNN training by adding speckle noise to the despeckled images. The proposed regularization improves both the feature robustness to speckle noise and SAR target recognition. Experiments on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition database demonstrate that the proposed CNN notably improves the classification accuracy compared with the conventional methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527544/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18528979","htmlLink":"/document/8527544/","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Speckle-Noise-Invariant Convolutional Neural Network for SAR Target Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2017R1C1B5017254 and 2018M3C1B8017549"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, under the ICT Consilience Creative Program supervised by the Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion","grantNumber":"IITP-2018-2011-1-00783"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004118","fundingName":"LG Display"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speckle-Noise-Invariant Convolutional Neural Network for SAR Target Recognition","sourcePdf":"lgrs-kim-2877599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070867S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8673667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8673667","articleId":"8527544","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527545,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Rezaei Aghdam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8727625/8527545/aghda-2880421-small.gif","p":["Sina Rezaei Aghdam (S\u201915\u2013M\u201918) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) in 2011 and 2013, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Bilkent University in 2018.

The vast majority of the existing studies in the area of physical layer security focus exclusively on the scenarios where the channel inputs are Gaussian distributed. However, in practice, the signals employed for transmission are drawn from discrete signal constellations such as phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation. Hence, understanding the impact of the finite-alphabet input constraints and designing secure transmission schemes under this assumption is a mandatory step toward a practical implementation of physical layer security. With this motivation, this paper reviews recent developments on physical layer security with finite-alphabet inputs. We explore transmit signal design algorithms for single-antenna as well as multi-antenna wiretap channels under different assumptions on the channel state information at the transmitter. Moreover, we present a review of the recent results on secure transmission with discrete signaling for various scenarios including multi-carrier transmission systems, broadcast channels with confidential messages, cognitive multiple access and relay networks. Throughout the article, we stress the important behavioral differences of discrete versus Gaussian inputs in the context of the physical layer security. We also present an overview of practical code construction over Gaussian and fading wiretap channels, and discuss some open problems and directions for future research.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2018.2880421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2018.2880421","startPage":"1829","endPage":"1850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8727625/08527545.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8727625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview of Physical Layer Security With Finite-Alphabet Signaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Physical Layer Security With Finite-Alphabet Signaling","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18726261","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8527545/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)","grantNumber":"113E223"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overview of Physical Layer Security With Finite-Alphabet Signaling","sourcePdf":"comst-rezaeiaghdam-2880421-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.356233S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8727625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8727625","articleId":"8527545","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8527546,"authors":[{"name":"Elisa Sacco","affiliation":["MICAS Laboratories, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Elisa","lastName":"Sacco","orcid":"0000-0002-0775-5815","id":"37086111402"},{"name":"Jorge Marin","affiliation":["MICAS Laboratories, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Marin","id":"37085785224"},{"name":"Johan Vergauwen","affiliation":["Melexis Technologies, Melexis, Tessenderlo, Belgium"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Vergauwen","id":"37086112813"},{"name":"Georges Gielen","affiliation":["MICAS Laboratories, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Gielen","id":"37275184800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8527546","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","Phase noise","Computer architecture","Quantization (signal)","Linearity","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","digital signal processing chips","integrated circuit noise","phase locked loops","phase noise","quantisation (signal)","sensors","signal conditioning circuits","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-based architectures","sensor interfaces","voltage-controlled oscillator","highly-digital scalable implementation","phase-locked loop","VCO nonlinearity","phase detection","VCO phase noise","performance limitation analysis","SNR","first-order quantization noise","closed-loop sensor-to-digital converter architectures","state-variable-based simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated circuits","sensor interface","sensor-to-digital converter","voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)","VCO-based","time-based","noise-shaping","\u03a3 \u0394"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527546","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8746742/08527546.pdf","startPage":"1114","endPage":"1118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2880258","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2880258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8746742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Limitation Analysis of Highly-Digital Time-Based Closed-Loop Sensor-to-Digital Converter Architectures","abstract":"This brief presents the theoretical and comparative analysis of two major time-based architectures for sensor interfaces.

As the proportion of dual-band APs and clients increase enormously, how to select which band to access to achieve considerable user experience is becoming essential in wireless network. Clients' native decisions that tend to prefer 5 GHz will consequently cause serious interference in 5 GHz and leave 2.4 GHz notably idle. Through analyzing a unique dataset in the wild, we quantitatively study the impact of various WiFi factors on the wireless delay. We propose a decision tree approach to intelligent access selection that decides which band to access dynamically according to prior learned schemes. A prototype of the access selection system named LazyAS, which only requires modification at AP side, is realized and deployed in a production WiFi network. Evaluation results demonstrate that LazyAS reduces the 90th percentile of wireless delay in the production WiFi network from 32 ms to 12 ms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8527549/","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18510100","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach to Client-Transparent Access Selection of Dual-Band WiFi","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFF0214700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61725206 and 61602448"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Approach to Client-Transparent Access Selection of Dual-Band WiFi","sourcePdf":"tnsm-zhang-2880222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124731S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8664201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8664201","articleId":"8527549","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8527553,"authors":[{"name":"Hyuk Su Son","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyuk Su","lastName":"Son","orcid":"0000-0003-4813-4780","id":"37958039800"},{"name":"Tae Hwan Jang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae Hwan","lastName":"Jang","orcid":"0000-0002-7004-3423","id":"37085626038"},{"name":"Seung Hun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Hun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086339861"},{"name":"Kyung Pil Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Pil","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086928615"},{"name":"Joon Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kunsan National University, Gunsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joon Hyung","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0003-0642-2338","id":"37560176400"},{"name":"Chul Soon Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chul Soon","lastName":"Park","id":"37085406318"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8527553","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":807},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527553","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Impedance","Power amplifiers","Wireless communication","Circuits and systems","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","millimetre wave power amplifiers","transformers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flat gain","pole-controlled transformer","transformer-based interstage matching network","pole-controlled PA","peak power-added efficiency","wireless chip-to-chip communication","zero in-band ripple condition","pole-controlled wideband CMOS power amplifier","sub-THz band","figure of merit","bandwidth 38.5 GHz","gain 15.8 dB","frequency 96.5 GHz to 135 GHz","efficiency 9.44 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","D-band","linearizer","millimeter wave (mm-wave)","sub-THz","power amplifier (PA)","power combiner","transformer","W-band","wideband"]}],"abstract":"This brief proposes a wideband CMOS power amplifier (PA) with flat gain using a pole-controlled transformer in the sub-THz band for wireless chip-to-chip communication.

First, a low-pass lumped-element ladder network is considered. Then the series inductors are replaced with commensurate transmission lines. As a result, a practically important mixed-element structure is obtained. Then the description of the structure by means of two frequency variables (one for shunt capacitors and one for transmission lines) is detailed: Explicit expressions for the coefficients of the descriptive two-variable polynomials in terms of the coefficients of the single variable boundary polynomials are derived for various numbers of elements, which are obtained first time in the literature. Finally, a mixed-element broadband matching network is designed to illustrate the usage of the obtained expressions. If it is preferred not to have shunt capacitors, they can be replaced with open-ended stubs via Richard's transformation. So the resultant circuit is extremely suitable for microstrip fabrication.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2880262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8781992/08527556.pdf","startPage":"1331","endPage":"1335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8781992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2880262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Mixed-Element Structures Formed With Shunt Capacitors Separated by Transmission Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Mixed-Element Structures Formed With Shunt Capacitors Separated by Transmission Lines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527556/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18881578","htmlLink":"/document/8527556/","volume":"66","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Kadir Has University Scientific Research Project","grantNumber":"2017-BAP-15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Mixed-Element Structures Formed With Shunt Capacitors Separated by Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"tcsii-sengul-2880262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043712S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8781992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8781992","articleId":"8527556","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8527635,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsin Aziz","affiliation":["iRadio Lab, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8635013/8527635/aziz-2877940-small.gif","p":["Mohsin Aziz received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.

In this paper, we present a new closed-form expression for the probability density function (PDF) of I and Q components in the presence of transmitter's impairments and propose a blind post-compensation approach for the mitigation of these impairments. These impairments include static PA nonlinearity and frequency-independent I/Q imbalance. The accuracy of the analytical PDF is evaluated using Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hellinger square distance. Simulation results show a reasonable correspondence between the derived PDF and non-parametric kernel density estimation-based PDF. After a closed-form PDF is obtained, higher order statistics-based method is used to estimate PA nonlinearity in the presence of I/Q impairments. Finally, a maximum-likelihood estimation of I/Q imbalance parameters is obtained using the analytical PDF. Simulation results show a normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) of around -40 dB and an adjacent channel power ratio of around -53 dBc, along with an error vector magnitude (EVM) of around 1%, for a 3-MHz local thermal equilibrium signal.

It is further coupled with industry standard BSIM-BULK, ASM-HEMT, and BSIM-CMG models for SPICE simulation and validated for various phase-transition FETs, illustrating the previously proposed steep switching effect and a subthreshold slope below the Boltzmann limit of 60 mV/decade.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8527638/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18364831","volume":"66","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Compact Modeling of Insulator\u2013Metal Transition Material-Based PhaseFET Including Hysteresis and Multidomain Switching","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DST Nanomission, Government of India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Compact Modeling of Insulator\u2013Metal Transition Material-Based PhaseFET Including Hysteresis and Multidomain Switching","sourcePdf":"ted-dasgupta-2877295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167613S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8585319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","xplore-issue":"8585319","articleId":"8527638","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8527642,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Chih Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chih","lastName":"Chen","id":"37078480100"},{"name":"Yu-Hsuan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hsuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37068279700"},{"name":"Jung-Lin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Lin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086111546"},{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huei","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-9903-1979","id":"37280092300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8527642","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2012},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Modulation","Linearity","Transistors","CMOS process","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","microwave power amplifiers","millimetre wave power amplifiers","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ka-band transformer-based Doherty power amplifier","leakage power","symmetrical Doherty structure","CMOS process","frequency 34.0 GHz","frequency 28.7 GHz to 41.9 GHz","gain 19.8 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS power amplifier (PA)","Doherty power amplifier (DPA)","PA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527642","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2018.2878133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2018.2878133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8542898","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8542898/08527642.pdf","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A <i>Ka</i>-Band Transformer-Based Doherty Power Amplifier for Multi-Gb/s Application in 90-nm CMOS","abstract":"A Ka-band transformer (TF)-based Doherty power amplifier (DPA) is designed and fabricated in 90-nm CMOS process.

A way to measure the charges diffusion time (time for the to be collected by the photodiode) using the analysis of an IRM is given. An unexpected phenomenon that occurs when performing a specific IRM is then showcased: performing two successive transfers, a short duration one followed by a long duration one is actually less efficient than performing a single transfer of long duration (same duration as the second transfer in the first case). Accordingly, a mathematical sufficient condition on the charge transfer efficiency function (CTEF) is enounced. A physical modeling based on thermionic emission theory and the influence of the potential barrier's width on its effective height is presented. The model leads to a new CTEF expression that fulfills the mathematical requirement. Finally, a numerical simulation with the new CTEF fitting the experimental IRM data is performed.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2018.2873632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8540961/08527643.pdf","startPage":"5400","endPage":"5405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2018.2873632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8540961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Analytical Charge Transfer Model for Time-of-Flight Image Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527643/","displayDocTitle":"A New Analytical Charge Transfer Model for Time-of-Flight Image Sensors","volume":"65","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18281138","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8527643/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Analytical Charge Transfer Model for Time-of-Flight Image Sensors","sourcePdf":"ted-deipanemamoreira-2873632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078419S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8540961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8540961","articleId":"8527643","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527648,"authors":[{"name":"Peijun Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8635013/8527648/wang-2877414-small.gif","p":["Peijun Wang (S\u201916) received the M.S. degree in basic mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","He is a Reviewer of the American Mathematical Society.

Motivated by this observation, we try to show how to achieve node-to-node synchronization and complete synchronization in multi-layer networks under directed switching communication topologies, where the nodes have Lur'e type dynamics. First, by using the multiple Lyapunov stability theory, we show that node-to-node synchronization in two-layer networks can be achieved by choosing sufficiently large coupling strength as well as suitable feedback gain matrix if the average dwell time is bounded below by some positive constants. The result is then extended to the case of multiple layers. Furthermore, if the inner communication topologies of each layer have a directed spanning tree with a common root, we show complete synchronization in the considered network can be achieved if the control parameters and the average dwell time are appropriately chosen. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through performing numerical simulations on Chua's circuit with double scroll attractors.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2018.2877414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8635013/08527648.pdf","startPage":"1141","endPage":"1152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8635013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2018.2877414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of Multi-Layer Networks: From Node-to-Node Synchronization to Complete Synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of Multi-Layer Networks: From Node-to-Node Synchronization to Complete Synchronization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527648/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18434417","htmlLink":"/document/8527648/","volume":"66","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673107, 61722303 and 61673104"},{"fundingName":"General Joint Fund of the Equipment Advance Research Program of the Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"6141A020223"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Networked Collective Intelligence","grantNumber":"BM2017002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DE180101268 and DP170102303"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China"},{"fundingName":"Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"KYCX17_0041"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of Multi-Layer Networks: From Node-to-Node Synchronization to Complete Synchronization","sourcePdf":"tcsi-yu-2877414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121396S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8635013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8635013","articleId":"8527648","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8527649,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, International Research Center for Intelligent Perception and Computation, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8697166/8527649/zhang-2876123-small.gif","p":["Mingyang Zhang received the B.S. degree in automation and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012 and 2018, respectively.","Since 2018, he has been a Lecturer with the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University.

Recently, due to the powerful ability of deep learning (DL) to extract spatial and spectral features, DL-based FE methods have shown great potentials for HSI processing. However, most of the DL-based FE methods are supervised, and the training of them suffers from the absence of labeled samples in HSIs severely. The training issue of supervised DL-based FE methods limits their application on HSI processing. To address this issue, in this paper, a novel modified generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to train a DL-based feature extractor without supervision. The designed GAN consists of two components, which are a generator and a discriminator. The generator can focus on the learning of real probability distributions of data sets and the discriminator can extract spatial-spectral features with superior invariance effectively. In order to learn upsampling and downsampling strategies adaptively during FE, the proposed generator and discriminator are designed based on a fully deconvolutional subnetwork and a fully convolutional subnetwork, respectively. Moreover, a novel min-max cost function is designed for training the proposed GAN in an end-to-end fashion without supervision, by utilizing the zero-sum game relationship between the generator and discriminator. Besides, the proposed modified GAN replaces the original Jensen-Shannon divergence with the Wasserstein distance, aiming to mitigate the unstability and difficulty of the training of GAN frameworks. Experimental results on three real data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527649/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8527649/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2019","accessionNumber":"18617338","volume":"57","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Feature Extraction in Hyperspectral Images Based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772393"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB0802200"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2018ZDXM-GY-045"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Feature Extraction in Hyperspectral Images Based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network","sourcePdf":"tgrs-gong-2876123-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.367514S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8697166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8697166","articleId":"8527649","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8527652,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangtao Zheng","affiliation":["Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning, State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8697166/8527652/zheng-2875304-small.gif","p":["Xiangtao Zheng received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in signal and information processing from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Xi\u2019an, China, in 2014 and 2017, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning, State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, CAS.

In real scenarios, HSIs are inevitably corrupted by noise because of sensors' imperfectness or atmospheric influence. Recently, many HSI denoising methods have been proposed to utilize the interband information between different spectral bands. However, these methods regard the HSI as a whole and treat the different spectral bands with the same noise level. In fact, the noise levels in different bands are different. Especially, only few certain bands are corrupted by noise, named the target noised bands. Under this circumstance, an HSI denoising method is proposed by considering the band relationship and different noise levels. The target noised bands are adaptively denoised by fusing some selected bands. Specifically, some related but quality superior bands are selected according to the target noised bands. Then, the target noised bands can be denoised by fusing the selected related bands. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performances in comparison with several state-of-the-art hyperspectral denoising methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Denoising by Fusing the Selected Related Bands","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2875304","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8697166/08527652.pdf","startPage":"2596","endPage":"2609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2875304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8697166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Denoising by Fusing the Selected Related Bands","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8527652/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18617334","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61632081, 61472413, 61772510 and 61806193"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"QYZDB-SSW-JSC015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011158","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics","grantNumber":"SKLST2017010"},{"fundingName":"CAS \u201cLight of West China\u201d Program","grantNumber":"XAB2017B26"},{"fundingName":"Xi\u2019an Postdoctoral Innovation Base Scientific Research Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Denoising by Fusing the Selected Related Bands","sourcePdf":"tgrs-lu-2875304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127573S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8697166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8697166","articleId":"8527652","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527658,"authors":[{"name":"Senzhang Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8782673/8527658/wang-2870948-small.gif","p":["Senzhang Wang received the M.Sc. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2016.

The effectiveness and efficiency of the existing GPS probe data-based traffic estimation models are largely limited due to the following two challenges. First, due to the low sampling frequency of GPS probes, probe data are usually sparse, especially for some road links not located in the central urban areas. Second, due to the very complex temporal and spatial dependencies among the road links, the variable space of the existing traffic estimation models is huge. It is time consuming to get an accurate estimation of a large arterial road network with thousands of road links. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes to extract traffic event signals from social media and incorporate them with GPS probe data to alleviate the data sparse issue. We first collect traffic-related posts that report various traffic events, including traffic jam, accident, and road construction from Twitter. By considering the GPS probe readings and the traffic event tweets as two types of observations, we next extend the conventional coupled hidden Markov model for integrating the two types of data to obtain a more accurate estimation of traffic conditions. To address the computational challenge, a parallel importance sampling-based electromagnetic algorithm is further introduced. We evaluate our model on the arterial network of downtown Chicago. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the model in both effectiveness and efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Traffic Estimation With Multi-Sourced Data by Parallel Coupled Hidden Markov Model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2018.2870948","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8782673/08527658.pdf","startPage":"3010","endPage":"3023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2018.2870948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8782673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527658","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6979/8782673/8527658-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527658/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Traffic Estimation With Multi-Sourced Data by Parallel Coupled Hidden Markov Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8527658/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18869439","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2016YFB1000802 and 2018YFB1003902"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61602237, 61772270 and 61672313"},{"fundingName":"Director\u2019s Project Fund of the Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2017KF03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20171420"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-1526499, IIS-1763325 and CNS-1626432"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Efficient Traffic Estimation With Multi-Sourced Data by Parallel Coupled Hidden Markov Model","sourcePdf":"tits-zhang-2870948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088578S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8782673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8782673","articleId":"8527658","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527663,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver De Candido","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8605558/8527663/candi-2879106-small.gif","p":["Oliver De Candido (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering and information technology from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany, in 2014 and 2017, respectively.

First, we analyze the achievable sum rate lower-bound using the Bussgang decomposition under new assumptions. In the presence of the non-linear quantization, our analysis indicates the potential merit of reconsidering traditional signal processing techniques in coarsely quantized systems, i.e., reconsidering transmit covariance matrices whose rank is equal to the rank of the channel. Furthermore, in the latter part of this paper, we propose a linear precoder design that achieves the predicted increase in performance compared with a state-of-the-art linear precoder design. Moreover, our linear signal processing algorithm allows for higher order modulation schemes to be employed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18400961","htmlLink":"/document/8527663/","displayDocTitle":"Reconsidering Linear Transmit Signal Processing in 1-Bit Quantized Multi-User MISO Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconsidering Linear Transmit Signal Processing in 1-Bit Quantized Multi-User MISO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-decandido-2879106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137797S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8527663","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":8527666,"authors":[{"name":"Md Badruddoja Majumder","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8628286/8527666/majum-2876693-small.gif","p":["Md Badruddoja Majumder (S\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2013.

In this paper, we design a new tag generation system for integrity checking of RRAM. A single read operation to a crossbar RRAM in the presence of sneak path currents can output a tag for the memory data that can be used for integrity checking. An analytical approach to model such a tag generation process is described in this paper. Security results predicted by the analytical model provide various design options leading to an optimal system from the perspective of considered security properties. The proposed design is simulated to investigate and verify the security properties of the system for a number of optimal design options predicted by the analytical model. Reliability of the proposed system is also measured for varying conditions of device parameters, operating temperatures, load resistances, and read voltage. Finally, the performance of the proposed system is compared against another existing lightweight tag generation method from the perspective of energy consumption, transistor count, and delay.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2876693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2876693","startPage":"416","endPage":"429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8628286/08527666.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Secure Integrity Checking System for Nanoelectronic Resistive RAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Secure Integrity Checking System for Nanoelectronic Resistive RAM","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18416861","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8527666/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-16-1-0301"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure Integrity Checking System for Nanoelectronic Resistive RAM","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-majumder-2876693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115598S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8628286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"8628286","articleId":"8527666","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8527670,"authors":[{"name":"Zati Bayani Zawawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, South Kensington Campus, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8605558/8527670/zawaw-2879092-small.gif","p":["Zati Bayani Zawawi received the M.Sc. degree in mobile communication systems from the University of Surrey, U.K., in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Imperial College London, U.K., in 2018.

Despite some progress in wirelessly powered backscatter communications, the focus has been on backscatter and energy harvesters (EHs). Recently, significant progress has been made on the design of the transmit multisine waveform, adaptive to the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), in a point-to-point backscatter system. In this paper, we leverage the work and study the design of the transmit multisine waveform in a multi-user backscatter system, made of one transmitter, one reader, and multiple tags active simultaneously. We derive an efficient algorithm to optimize the transmit waveform so as to identify the tradeoff between the amount of energy harvested at the tags and the reliability of the communication, measured in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the reader. The performance with the optimized waveform based on the linear and nonlinear EH models is studied. The numerical results demonstrate the benefits of accounting for the EH nonlinearity, multiuser diversity, frequency diversity, and multisine waveform adaptive to the CSIT to enlarge the SINR-energy region.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2879092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2879092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8605558/08527670.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Wirelessly Powered Backscatter Communications: Nonlinearity, Waveform Design, and SINR-Energy Tradeoff","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Wirelessly Powered Backscatter Communications: Nonlinearity, Waveform Design, and SINR-Energy Tradeoff","volume":"18","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8527670/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18392497","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527670/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P003885/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Wirelessly Powered Backscatter Communications: Nonlinearity, Waveform Design, and SINR-Energy Tradeoff","sourcePdf":"twc-clerckx-2879092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108875S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8527670","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8527675,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyuan Chen","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8782673/8527675/chen-2871269-small.gif","p":["Yuanyuan Chen received the B.E. degree in automation from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2018.

In this paper, we focus on a specific problem in social media mining which is to extract traffic relevant microblogs from Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform. It is transformed into a machine learning problem of short text classification. First, we apply the continuous bag-of-word model to learn word embedding representations based on a data set of three billion microblogs. Compared to the traditional one-hot vector representation of words, word embedding can capture semantic similarity between words and has been proved effective in natural language processing tasks. Next, we propose using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models and their combination LSTM-CNN to extract traffic relevant microblogs with the learned word embeddings as inputs. We compare the proposed methods with competitive approaches, including the support vector machine (SVM) model based on a bag of n-gram features, the SVM model based on word vector features, and the multi-layer perceptron model based on word vector features. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning approaches.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8782673/08527675.pdf","startPage":"3049","endPage":"3058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Traffic Information From Social Media Texts With Deep Learning Approaches","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2018.2871269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8782673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2018.2871269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Traffic Information From Social Media Texts With Deep Learning Approaches","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18869426","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8527675/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61533019, 71232006 and 61233001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Traffic Information From Social Media Texts With Deep Learning Approaches","sourcePdf":"tits-wang-2871269-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13172S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8782673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8782673","articleId":"8527675","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8527680,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Shi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8605558/8527680/shi-2879109-small.gif","p":["Jia Shi received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Southampton, U.K., in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

The novel performance analysis is studied based on the general backhaul network (GBN) and the simplified backhaul network (SBN) models. To analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability of the backhaul networks, a range of the exact- and closed-form expressions are derived for both the GBN and SBN models. With the aid of the tractable model, the optimal power control algorithm is proposed for maximizing the trade-off between energy-efficiency (EE) and area spectral-efficiency (ASE) for the mm-wave backhaul networks. The analytical results of the SINR coverage probability are validated, and they match those obtained from Monte-Carlo experiments. The numerical results of the ASE performance demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our P2MP architecture over the traditional point-to-point setup. Moreover, our P2MP mm-wave backhaul networks are able to achieve dramatically higher rate performance than that obtained by the ultra-high-frequency networks. Furthermore, to achieve optimal EE and ASE tradeoff, the mm-wave backhaul networks should be designed to limit the link distances and line-of-sight interferences while optimizing the transmission power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"18","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18392490","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8527680/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Point-to-Multipoint Millimeter Wave Backhaul Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU H2020 TWEETHER Project","grantNumber":"644678"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61631015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society","grantNumber":"IEC170324"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P015883/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Point-to-Multipoint Millimeter Wave Backhaul Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-ni-2879109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158517S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8527680","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8527681,"authors":[{"name":"Shivani Bathla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8628286/8527681/bathl-2876917-small.gif","p":["Shivani Bathla received the B.E. degree (honors) from BITS Pilani, Pilani, India, in 2011 and the M.S. degree from IIT Madras, Chennai, India, in 2017, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","From 2011 to 2014, she was a Design Engineer at Texas Instruments, Bengaluru, India.

Using the activities obtained, we compute a criticality metric to identify the nets where glitch minimization techniques are likely to provide the maximum benefit. The proposed metric provides insight into which techniques are best suited for use in glitch reduction for a given circuit. This enables targeted application of glitch reduction techniques. Experiments with several glitch intensive benchmarks show a faster convergence within fewer iterations to solutions with reduced glitch activity. We validate this observation by using the proposed metric to guide the application of some glitch reduction techniques and quantify the resultant savings. The proposed algorithm can be seamlessly incorporated in modern event-driven logic simulators.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2876917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2876917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8628286/08527681.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simulation-Based Metric to Guide Glitch Power Reduction in Digital Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Simulation-Based Metric to Guide Glitch Power Reduction in Digital Circuits","volume":"27","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8527681/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18439126","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527681/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004316","fundingName":"International Business Machines Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulation-Based Metric to Guide Glitch Power Reduction in Digital Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bathla-2876917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091608S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8628286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8628286","articleId":"8527681","onlineDate":"08 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8527726,"authors":[{"name":"Jafar Alim Habibi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Jafar Alim","lastName":"Habibi","id":"37283433800"},{"name":"Fahrizal Djohar","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Fahrizal","lastName":"Djohar","id":"37086509780"},{"name":"Rifqy Hakimi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Rifqy","lastName":"Hakimi","id":"37085990780"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6163-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6161-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6162-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6164-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8527726","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Computer architecture","Edge computing","Vehicular ad hoc networks","Cloud computing","Servers","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cloud computing","Internet of Things","machine-to-machine communication","mobile computing","software defined networking","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN-based vehicular network framework","5G services","mobile edge computing","massive communication","machine-to-machine","vehicle-to-vehicle","vehicle-to-infrastructure","fog computing","massive Internet of Everything","IoE","5G-based SDN","M2M","V2V","V2I","MEC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fog","mobile edge","computing","framework","vehicular network"]}],"abstract":"The development of 5G and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are compassed to be singular comprehensive line to allocate massive communication in the future.

Many of desktop virtualization initiatives considered as fail because it run smooth during trial, but facing bottlenecks during real-life operation. Not surprising, since during trial, we dealt only with very small quantity of VMs, compared with production. Some enterprise solution with focus on storage performance has proposed full-flash storage solution, but for small to medium scale organization that had budget constrains may prefer DAS (Direct Attached Storage) or NAS (Network Access Storage). Of course DAS and NAS had limitation in performance compared with SAN, then some vendors offer server-side caching solution for virtualization that utilize RAM (Random Access Memory) or flash drive to leverage the storage performance. This experimental test was conducted to evaluate DAS and NAS from two perspectives (Performance and initial-investment cost), using IOmeter as workload simulator and benchmark tools for five storage scenarios, all configured in RAID10 and using server-side caching as storage accelerator. This experimental test also intended to answer which storage approach (between DAS and NAS) that most suitable with ABC's requirement, ABC was a university located in Jakarta. Three scenarios from DAS-based approach, labeled as SAS7.2k, SAS10k, SAS15k, and two other scenarios from NAS-based approach was labeled as NAS1-7.2k, and NAS2-7.2k. When talked about performance, we focused on three critical parameters (IOPS, bandwidth and latency). While SAS15k (DAS-based) and NAS2-7.2k (NAS-based) were the top performer from each respective category, the author found that NAS2-7.2k was the best option, it outperformed SAS15k that 9,11% higher in price. NAS2-7.2k had 108,14% higher in total IOs per second (Represent IOPS), 108,1% higher in total MBs per second (Represent bandwidth), and 107,53% lower in average IOs response time (Represent latency) when compared with SAS15k.","doi":"10.1109/ICWT.2018.8527830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8527723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWT.2018.8527830","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Wireless and Telematics (ICWT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Wireless and Telematics (ICWT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510708/8527723/08527830.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Cache-Accelerated Approach on DAS and NAS as Storage Solution for Small Scale Virtual Desktop Deployment \u2013 A Case Study at ABC University","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-13 July 2018","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Cache-Accelerated Approach on DAS and NAS as Storage Solution for Small Scale Virtual Desktop Deployment \u2013 A Case Study at ABC University","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8527830/","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18249478","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527830/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Cache-Accelerated Approach on DAS and NAS as Storage Solution for Small Scale Virtual Desktop Deployment \u2013 A Case Study at ABC University","confLoc":"Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"08-PID5480225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089961S","chronDate":"12-13 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510708","isNumber":"8527723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510708","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8527723","articleId":"8527830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8527833,"authors":[{"name":"Fadil Hamdani","affiliation":["Radio Telecommunication and Microwave Laboratory, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Fadil","lastName":"Hamdani","id":"37086513081"},{"name":"Mohammad Sigit Arifianto","affiliation":["Radio Telecommunication and Microwave Laboratory, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Sigit","lastName":"Arifianto","id":"37428113100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6163-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6161-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6162-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6164-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8527833","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","femtocellular radio","multi-access systems","probability","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detection spectrum sensing","dynamic spectrum access","BER","femtocell base station","bit error rate","channel usage priority level","interference signature","cognitive radio","wireless channel","sparse code multiple access system","imperfect channel sensing","uplink cognitive femtocell SCMA systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision threshold","femtocell","SCMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the performance of a femtocell implementing sparse code multiple access (SCMA) system, which has the ability to access the wireless channel opportunistically using cognitive radio (CR) capabilities.

Simulation result show degradation of bit error rate (BER) when probability of missed detection of energy detection spectrum sensing increase. It is also shown that as the decision threshold of energy detection become higher, the number of received bit error in the femtocell base station increased.","doi":"10.1109/ICWT.2018.8527833","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Wireless and Telematics (ICWT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Wireless and Telematics (ICWT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510708/8527723/08527833.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWT.2018.8527833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8527723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance Evaluations of Uplink Cognitive Femtocell SCMA Systems Under Imperfect Channel Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8527833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 July 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8527833/","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance Evaluations of Uplink Cognitive Femtocell SCMA Systems Under Imperfect Channel Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18249487","htmlLink":"/document/8527833/","conferenceDate":"12-13 July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance Evaluations of Uplink Cognitive Femtocell SCMA Systems Under Imperfect Channel Sensing","confLoc":"Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"21-PID5575967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067216S","chronDate":"12-13 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510708","isNumber":"8527723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510708","xplore-issue":"8527723","articleId":"8527833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8527835,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sigit Arifianto","affiliation":["ITB, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Sigit","lastName":"Arifianto","id":"37428113100"},{"name":"Azwar Mudzakkir Ridwan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, UIN SGD Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Azwar Mudzakkir","lastName":"Ridwan","id":"37086312484"},{"name":"Maulana Randa","affiliation":["Department of Research and Development, The Ministry of Defense, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Maulana","lastName":"Randa","id":"37085393581"},{"name":"Achmad Munir","affiliation":["ITB, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Achmad","lastName":"Munir","id":"37312083500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6163-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6161-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6162-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6164-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8527835","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectangular waveguides","Dielectric materials","Resonant frequency","Loaded waveguides","Time-domain analysis","Hollow waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anisotropic media","dielectric materials","dielectric waveguides","electric fields","finite difference time-domain analysis","magnetic fields","rectangular waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetics problems","EM problems","magnetic field","electric field","hollow rectangular waveguide","finite-difference time-domain method","3D-FDTD method","anisotropic dielectric material","resonant frequency analysis","size 40.0 mm","size 20.0 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D-FDTD method","anisotropic dielectric material","rectangular waveguide","resonant frequency"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the resonant frequency analysis based on three dimension (3D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for rectangular waveguide which is loaded with anisotropic dielectric material.

Compared with the dc/ac/dc converter based on modular multilevel converter, the non-isolated modular dc/dc converter (MDCC) offers lower cost and higher efficiency, due to the elimination of the ac transformer and reduced submodules (SMs). However, the MDCC based on the half bridge SM (HBSM) can not block the dc short fault. Therefore, the MDCC with the hybrid configuration of the unipolar full-bridge SM (UFBSM) and HBSM, which achieves the dc fault blocking capability, is analysed in this paper, and a damping resistor is introduced in the UFBSM to reduce the ascending voltage of the SM capacitor under dc fault. The fault blocking mechanism of the converter is described, and the fast recovery strategy is presented to ride through the temporary fault. In addition, the design principle of the converter is discussed through a study case.

After demonstrating the inefficiency of the conventional long-term evolution (LTE)-based RAP for HVUs in mmWave networks, linear-frequency-modulation-based RAP (LFM RAP) is proposed for the detection of HVUs. The correlation of LTE-based RAP, and ambiguity and extended-ambiguity functions of LFM RAP are analyzed to examine their properties affected by the high-velocity of the user. The performance of RAPs is evaluated through detection and false alarm probabilities in a high-velocity and multiuser environment. The results show that the LFM RAP is appropriate for HVUs in mmWave cellular networks because of its high-detection probability in a high-speed environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8528305/","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2018","publicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Random Access Preamble Design for High-Velocity User in Millimeter-Wave Cellular Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"MSIT 2018R1A2B2002621 and 2018R1A4A1023826"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Random Access Preamble Design for High-Velocity User in Millimeter-Wave Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"access-cho-2878818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117973S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8528305","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8528318,"authors":[{"name":"Le Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-2298-3901","id":"37086586202"},{"name":"Jianzhong Qi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianzhong","lastName":"Qi","id":"37086521468"},{"name":"Peng Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Song","id":"37086521440"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8528318","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528318","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Detectors","Receivers","Complexity theory","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","continuous phase modulation","error statistics","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear approximation","CPM signal","closed-loop architecture","derivative matched filters","pulse amplitude modulation approximation","simplified direct-decision synchronization algorithm","coherent CPM receiver","linear phase approximation","simplified decision-directed synchronization algorithm","continuous phase modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous phase modulation","synchronization","coherent demodulation","decision-directed estimation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a simplified decision-directed synchronization algorithm for continuous phase modulation (CPM) based on the linear approximation to the phase of the CPM signal.

We consider two vehicular communication scenarios with the assistance of roadside unit (RSU), i.e., RSU-to-vehicle-to-vehicle (RVV) and vehicle-to-RSU-tovehicle (VRV) scenarios. In particular, we analyze the outage performance of vehicular networks with the amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols under the effect of residual loopback-interference (LBI) and channel estimation errors. For RVV scenario, the upper bounds for the outage probability of the AF based FD and HD relaying over double Rayleigh fading channels are derived. Moreover, we derive the approximate closed form expressions for the outage probability of the DF based FD and HD relaying protocol over Rayleigh fading channels; For VRV scenario, the exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the AF and DF relaying protocols are presented in case of FD and HD modes. Furthermore, we derive the approximate closed-form expressions for the outage probability of hybrid FD/HD mode on AF and DF relaying protocols.

Different from the traditional ground-only communications, the control techniques tightly impact UAV communications, which could be jointly designed to enhance the performance of data transmission. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and challenges of combining the communications and control in UAV systems. For single-UAV scenario, we introduce a new frequency-dependent 3D channel model. We then show how to perform channel tracking with a flight control system as well as how to mechanically and electronically formulate the transmission beams. For multi-UAV scenario, we present new techniques as cooperative communications, self-positioning, trajectory design, resource allocation, and seamless coverage. In the end, we provide some interesting discussions over communication protocol, secrecy, 3D dynamic topology heterogeneous networks, and low-cost design for practical UAV applications.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08528342.pdf","startPage":"67519","endPage":"67527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Communications and Control for UAV Systems: Opportunities and Challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Communications and Control for UAV Systems: Opportunities and Challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528342/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8528342/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61531011, 61771274 and 61831013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4182030"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Key Laboratory Project","grantNumber":"2017B030314147"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871398"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Integrating Communications and Control for UAV Systems: Opportunities and Challenges","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-2879637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068255S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8528342","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528343,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528343/tang-2878732-small.gif","p":["Hua Tang was born in Kaili, China, in 1987.

Fortunately, the antenna selection is an effective way to solve the problem, which can capture most of the advantages of massive MIMO. In this paper, a novel global-searching-based iterative swapping antenna selection method is proposed under the partial channel knowledge case for massive MIMO based on capacity maximization. The method is investigated with detailed mathematical derivations, as well as convergence discussion. Both global-searching-based \u201clocal\u201d swapping (GSL-swapping) and global-searching-based \u201cglobal\u201d swapping algorithms are proposed for massive MIMO with imperfect channel state information (CSI). The former exchanges the selected antenna with the unselected one which is \u201cbetter\u201d than the selected one. Different from the GSL-swapping algorithm, the latter only swaps the \u201cworst\u201d selected antenna with the \u201cbest\u201d unselected antenna which is \u201cbetter\u201d than the \u201cworst\u201d selected one. In addition, an improved global-searching-based \u201cglobal\u201d swapping algorithm with imperfect CSI is proposed to further decrease the complexity. Due to the \u201cglobal searching\u201d characteristic, the proposed algorithms can obtain a near optimal performance. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the proposed algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global-Searching-Based Iterative Swapping Antenna Selection for Massive MIMO Systems with Imperfect Channel Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878732","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08528343.pdf","startPage":"66557","endPage":"66564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Global-Searching-Based Iterative Swapping Antenna Selection for Massive MIMO Systems with Imperfect Channel Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8528343/","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Global-Searching-Based Iterative Swapping Antenna Selection for Massive MIMO Systems with Imperfect Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"access-tang-2878732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056782S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8528343","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528346,"authors":[{"name":"Puning Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528346/zhang-2873662-small.gif","p":["Puning Zhang received the Ph.D. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2017.

The cellular D2D caching technology can offload part of the traffic of the base station and effectively alleviate the data transmission pressure of the base station.

Therefore, the cooperative willingness aware collaborative caching mechanism towards cellular D2D communication (CWCM) is proposed.

Second, a D2D UE service relationship perception method is presented in which the content cache and the content discard records are used to comprehensively consider the cooperative and non-cooperative behavior to sense the service relationship between D2D UEs. Third, a collaborative willingness awareness caching mechanism is designed by considering the cache capability of the UE and the service relationship between the UEs. Simulation results show that the proposed CWCM can greatly improve the cache hit rate, largely reduce the transmission energy consumption, and average delay.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08528346.pdf","startPage":"67046","endPage":"67056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Willingness Aware Collaborative Caching Mechanism Towards Cellular D2D Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528346","topic":"Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528346/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Willingness Aware Collaborative Caching Mechanism Towards Cellular D2D Communication","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8528346/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771082"},{"fundingName":"Program for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing","grantNumber":"CXTDX201601020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007957","fundingName":"Chongqing Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"KJQN201800615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cooperative Willingness Aware Collaborative Caching Mechanism Towards Cellular D2D Communication","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2873662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108246S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications"],"articleId":"8528346","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528347,"authors":[{"name":"Benying Tan","affiliation":["The School of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of Aizu, Aizuwakamatsu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528347/tan-2879336-small.gif","p":["Benying Tan received the B.E. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree from The University of Aizu, Japan, in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Applying an adaptive dictionary for sparse representation of nonnegative signals has been shown to be very effective; but constructing adaptive dictionary, i.e., dictionary learning, remains a challenge. In this paper, we attempt to design an effective and tailored algorithm for the sparse representation of nonnegative signals. We consider the so-called determinant sparsity measure formed with the determinant of the Gram matrix of sparse coefficients. Based on the determinant measure, we formulate the nonnegative dictionary learning problem that is optimization of a non-convex function. For reducing the computational complexity of the optimization, the difference of convex functions (DC) programming is employed since the non-convex function can be set to the form of difference of two convex functions. Because there are two variables in the dictionary learning problem that cannot be solved directly by DC programming, an alternation scheme is employed to treat the sparse coding and dictionary update of the dictionary learning problem alternatively with the DC programming. Our proposed novel dictionary learning algorithm has three advantages: 1) the higher recovery ratio is achieved by the proposed algorithm, even when the signals are weakly sparse; 2) the generalization ability of the proposed algorithm is greater, more often converging to a global solution than to local optimal solutions; and 3) the obtained sparse solution has a low-overlapping property that enables the solutions to be sparse and makes the proposed algorithm robust. Numerical experiments and experiments using real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879336","startPage":"67301","endPage":"67315","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08528347.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonnegative Sparse Representation of Signals With a Determinant-Type Sparsity Measure Based on the DC Programming","topic":"Theory, Algorithms, and Applications of Sparse Recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Nonnegative Sparse Representation of Signals With a Determinant-Type Sparsity Measure Based on the DC Programming","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8528347/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528347/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001863","fundingName":"New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"KAKENHI 18K18083 and KAKENHI 16K00335"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Nonnegative Sparse Representation of Signals With a Determinant-Type Sparsity Measure Based on the DC Programming","sourcePdf":"access-tan-2879336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103052S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Theory, Algorithms, and Applications of Sparse Recovery"],"articleId":"8528347","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8528349,"authors":[{"name":"Jue Wang","affiliation":["Nantong Research Institute for Advanced Communication Technologies, Nantong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528349/wang-2879902-small.gif","p":["Jue Wang (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in communications engineering from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2006, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the National Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

In addition to the conventional MF/HF/VHF bands, there has been increasing interests in the utilization of higher frequency bands to provide broadband data service to the sea area. To design efficient maritime communication systems, the first and a fundamental requirement is to develop a framework to understand the wireless channels. In an integrated air-ground-sea communications network, there are two major type of channels to be investigated, namely the air-to-sea channel (e.g., for communication links from the aircraft-based base stations or relays) and the near-sea-surface channel (for land-to-ship/ship-to-land or ship-to-ship communications). Due to the unique features of the maritime propagation environment such as sparse scattering, sea wave movement, and the ducting effect over the sea surface, the modeling of these maritime channel links differs from conventional terrestrial wireless channels in many aspects and, consequently, will result in significant impact on the transceiver design. In this survey, we highlight the most notable differences from the modeling perspective as well as the channel characteristics for the air-to-sea and near-sea-surface channel links, with more focus on the latter. After a thorough review of existing modeling approaches and measurement campaigns, we conclude that the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sparse</i>\n and the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">location-dependent</i>\n properties constitute the most important and distinctive characteristics of the maritime wireless channels.

The analysis of brain tumors without human intervention is considered a significant area of research because the extracted brain images need to be optimized using a segmentation algorithm that is highly resilient to noise and cluster size sensitivity problems and automatically detects the region of interest (ROI). In this paper, an improved orthogonal gamma distribution-based machine-learning approach is used to analyze the under- segments and over-segments of brain tumor regions to automatically detect abnormalities in the ROI. Further data imbalances due to improper edge matching in the abnormal region is sampled by matching the edge coordinates and sensitivity, and the selectivity parameters are measured using the machine learning algorithm. The benchmark medical image database was collected and analyzed to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the optimal automatic detection in tumor and non-tumor regions. The mean error rate of the algorithm was determined using a mathematical formulation. The system is evaluated based on experimental results that showed the method of orthogonal gamma distribution with the machine learning approach attained an accuracy of 99.55% in detecting brain tumors. This research contributes to the field of brain abnormality detection and analysis without human intervention in the health care sector.","topic":"New Trends in Brain Signal Processing and Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8528358/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2019","publicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning Approach-Based Gamma Distribution for Brain Tumor Detection and Data Sample Imbalance Analysis","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Machine Learning Approach-Based Gamma Distribution for Brain Tumor Detection and Data Sample Imbalance Analysis","sourcePdf":"access-manogaran-2878276-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074378S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["New Trends in Brain Signal Processing and Analysis"],"articleId":"8528358","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8528362,"authors":[{"name":"Mike O.

A simple current source or lumped-port model is introduced in formulation of a determinant FEM algorithm. By incorporating the SOC in the FEM solver, the intrinsic port discontinuity caused by this port model is then fully removed or calibrated out of the core non-planar periodic guided-wave structure during the calibration process. Because of the 3-D nature of FEM, the effective per-unit-length parameters of the core periodic guided-wave structure, i.e., effective propagation constant and effective characteristic impedance, are extracted successfully. Two numerical examples, including microstrip line with periodical loading of shorting pins and metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal composite right/left handed structure, are numerically modeled for demonstration and verification. Extracted results have validated the feasibility and accuracy of the presented FEM-SOC, thereby exhibiting its advanced capability in numerical modeling and de-embedding of non-planar structures with

used in several scientific domains. It is well recognized that computation times on distributed clusters are often dominated by the slowest workers (called stragglers). Recent work has demonstrated that straggler mitigation can be viewed as a problem of designing erasure codes. For matrices A and B, the technique essentially maps the computation of ATB into the multiplication of smaller (coded) submatrices. The stragglers are treated as erasures in this process. The computation can be completed as long as a certain number of workers (called the recovery threshold) complete their assigned tasks. We present a novel coding strategy for this problem when the absolute values of the matrix entries are sufficiently small. We demonstrate a tradeoff between the assumed absolute value bounds on the matrix entries and the recovery threshold. At one extreme, we are optimal with respect to the recovery threshold, and on the other extreme, we match the threshold of prior work. Experimental results on cloud-based clusters validate the benefits of our method.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4234/8605392/8528366-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"23","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18392443","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8528366/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Erasure Coding for Distributed Matrix Multiplication for Matrices With Bounded Entries","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1718470"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Erasure Coding for Distributed Matrix Multiplication for Matrices With Bounded Entries","sourcePdf":"lcomm-ramamoorthy-2880213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115534S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8605392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8605392","articleId":"8528366","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-03"},{"_id":8528368,"authors":[{"name":"Yajun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computational Sciences, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhangjiagang, China"],"firstName":"Yajun","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-0512-9922","id":"37086196722"},{"name":"Renjie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Renjie","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-5662-6745","id":"37086813415"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-1042-6297","id":"37598871100"},{"name":"Feng Shu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Shu","orcid":"0000-0003-0073-1965","id":"37296299900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8528368","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Time-domain analysis","Frequency-domain analysis","Kernel","Search problems","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","computational complexity","error statistics","filtering theory","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","OFDM systems","average power ratio reduction problem","tone reservation-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","parallel Tabu search-based scheme","sub-optimal peak reduction tone","sub-optimal PRT set","bit error rate performances","adaptive amplitude clipping","PTS-based PRT scheme","secondary peaks","AICF scheme","fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm","peak to average power ratio reduction problem","adaptive iterative clipping and filtering method","adaptive scaling","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PAPR","tone reservation","parallel tabu search"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we focus on the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction problem in tone reservation-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems.

After finding the sub-optimal PRT set, we apply it in an adaptive iterative clipping and filtering (AICF) method for PAPR reduction. Furthermore, PAPR reduction and bit error rate (BER) performances are compared among the AICF method, the adaptive scaling, the adaptive amplitude clipping and the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm schemes. Simulation results verify that the PTS-based PRT scheme can obtain better secondary peaks with lower computational complexity, and the AICF scheme effectively reduces PAPR with a faster convergence speed while its BER performance is only slightly worse than for the existing methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction Based on Parallel Tabu Search for Tone Reservation in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2018.2880432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8685245/08528368.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2018.2880432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8685245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction Based on Parallel Tabu Search for Tone Reservation in OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8528368/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18598661","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61727802, 61872184 and 61501238"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK20150786"},{"fundingName":"Specially Appointed Professor Program in Jiangsu Province, 2015"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"30916011205"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2017D04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction Based on Parallel Tabu Search for Tone Reservation in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"lwc-li-2880432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09446S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8685245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8685245","articleId":"8528368","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528374,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The integrated interference analyzer achieves the highly reliable connection in the presence of the undesired signal and hence improves the frequency usage efficiency by identifying the wireless LAN (WLAN) and other signals in the 2G/5G band.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2018.2877168","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/8580626/08528383.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8580626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2018.2877168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"3688","endPage":"3699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 802.11ax 4 - 4 High-Efficiency WLAN AP Transceiver SoC Supporting 1024-QAM With Frequency-Dependent IQ Calibration and Integrated Interference Analyzer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"An 802.11ax 4 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$ </tex-math></inline-formula> 4 High-Efficiency WLAN AP Transceiver SoC Supporting 1024-QAM With Frequency-Dependent IQ Calibration and Integrated Interference Analyzer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528383/","volume":"53","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8528383/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18365051","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 802.11ax 4 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$ </tex-math></inline-formula> 4 High-Efficiency WLAN AP Transceiver SoC Supporting 1024-QAM With Frequency-Dependent IQ Calibration and Integrated Interference Analyzer","sourcePdf":"jssc-kawai-2877168-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162364S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8580626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8580626","articleId":"8528383","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8528386,"authors":[{"name":"Rony Kumer Saha","affiliation":["Future Access Network Division, KDDI Research, Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528386/saha-2879835-small.gif","p":["Rony Kumer Saha received the M.Eng. degree in information and communications technologies from the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, in 2017.

Control-and user-plane of each cell is decoupled. The clustering technique consists of two levels of clustering such that level 1 clustering defines an initial 3D femtocell cluster size. Level 2 clustering defines a cooperating set of femtocells per floor within each level 1 cluster to explore joint transmission coordinated multipoint (CoMP) during off-states of their transmit power. Femtocells are split at the MAC layer, and a mechanism is presented to model the bandwidth and latency fronthaul constraints. We derive the system level aggregate capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. We then develop a heuristic algorithm and discuss its scheduler implementation. With numerical and simulation results, we show with an example scenario that the proposed technique can achieve the maximum CoMP capacity gain of 44% per building and 32.15% in overall system level. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed technique can achieve the performance requirements of 5G cellular systems and point out the significance and further research issues.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Technique for Cloud Based Clustering and Spatial Resource Reuse and Scheduling of 3D In-Building Small Cells Using CoMP for High Capacity CRAN","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879835","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08528386.pdf","startPage":"71602","endPage":"71621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"A Technique for Cloud Based Clustering and Spatial Resource Reuse and Scheduling of 3D In-Building Small Cells Using CoMP for High Capacity CRAN","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8528386/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18597628","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Technique for Cloud Based Clustering and Spatial Resource Reuse and Scheduling of 3D In-Building Small Cells Using CoMP for High Capacity CRAN","sourcePdf":"access-saha-2879835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102315S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8528386","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528390,"authors":[{"name":"John W.

The link employs an energy-efficient, single-ended ground-referenced signaling scheme. Implemented in 16-nm FinFET CMOS technology, the link operates at a data rate of 25 Gb/s/pin with 1.17-pJ/bit energy efficiency and uses a simple but robust matched-delay clock forwarding scheme that cancels most sources of jitter. The modest frequency-dependent attenuation of short-reach links is compensated using an analog equalizer in the transmitter. The receiver includes active-inductor peaking in the input amplifier to improve overall receiver frequency response. The link employs a novel power supply regulation scheme at both ends that uses a PLL ring-oscillator supply voltage as a reference to flatten circuit speed and reduce power consumption variation across PVT. The link can be calibrated once at an arbitrary voltage and temperature, then track VT variation without the need for periodic re-calibration. The link operates over a 10-mm-long on-package channel with -4 dB of attenuation with 0.77-UI eye opening at bit-error rate (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-15</sup>\n.

In addition, based on the covariance matrix estimation technology of the newly proposed knowledge-aided STAP method, two knowledge-aided persymmetric adaptive detectors in the nonhomogeneous environment are proposed as well. First, a two-step design procedure-based detector is proposed for the partially homogeneous model, which is called knowledge-aided persymmetric adaptive coherence estimator.

IoT data analytics can be defined as a process to control and optimize decision making in real time, by analyzing huge chunks of IoT sensor data. Moreover, data analytics stands on the shoulders of sensor data aggregation that includes data pre-processing and routing. This paper envisions two open problems of data aggregation, first, raw IoT sensor data is highly uncertain, second, the traditional algorithms are not fit for processing highly uncertain sensor data. This is formally known as data veracity problem. This paper proposes a data aggregation scheme for highly uncertain raw IoT sensor data collected using the device to device communication. The approach initially reconstructs the subspace using sample data and then it iteratively tracks down the low-rank approximation of the dominant subspace in the presence of high uncertainties at the fog server. Later, the robust dominant subspace is used to estimate a more reliable true sensor data matrix from the highly uncertain raw IoT sensor data traffic matrix. Moreover, the proposed scheme achieves the aforementioned tasks while processing the raw IoT sensor data without any prior information, i.e., in a fully unsupervised fashion. The existing literature based on sampling, approximation, and data reduction either causes random data reduction or destruction of global characteristics of the raw data. However, unlike the existing solutions, the proposed method removes the uncertainties while preserving the global characteristics of the raw data. Performance evaluations conducted using both the real world sensor data and synthetic data injected with noise, outliers, and missing values. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can estimate a reliable true sensor data matrix in the presence of high uncertainties and the energy efficient device to device communication-based data delivery mechanism can accommodate a large number of IoT devices.","topic":"Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528395/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8528395/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving Quality of Data: IoT Data Aggregation Using Device to Device Communications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771082"},{"fundingName":"Program for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing","grantNumber":"CXTDX201601020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007957","fundingName":"Chongqing Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"KJQN201800615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Improving Quality of Data: IoT Data Aggregation Using Device to Device Communications","sourcePdf":"access-sanyal-2878640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067646S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications"],"articleId":"8528395","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528400,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Xu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Information Service Engineering, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528400/xu-2878995-small.gif","p":["Cheng Xu (M\u201917) received the B.E. and MA.Sc. degrees from the Beijing Key Laboratory of Information Service Engineering, Beijing Union University, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

This information also needs to be shared with other vehicles. The effective integration of information and the strong privacy protection are the key restrictions on the development of the V2X. The previous privacy protection model has mainly focused on the centralized network, and there were problems with the centralized gateway and single-point decision, which were not suitable for the decentralized scenario. Therefore, this paper proposes a remote attestation security model based on a privacy-preserving blockchain. The overall model involves two core steps. First, the vehicle provides the network with an evidence of a credible identity and integrity. Secured, the vehicles in the network calculate the nodes to make their respective decisions, and the accounting nodes summarize the sub-conclusions, form the final results, and write them into data blocks.

Due to the energy constraint and energy imbalanced dissipation of underwater nodes, it is a challenge to maximize the energy efficiency and balance energy consumption simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm for target tracking in UWSNs to address this issue. First, for maximizing the energy efficiency, we design an adaptive sampling interval adjustment (ASIA) method using a two-input-single-output fuzzy logic controller. In this method, the sampling interval is adaptively adjusted to make the actually uncertainty equal to the uncertainty threshold, which minimizes the sampling frequency and then reduces the energy consumption of information exchange. Second, for balancing the energy consumption, we develop a dynamic uncertainty threshold adjustment (DUTA) method using a single-input-single-output fuzzy logic controller. According to the residual energy of network nodes, the DUTA method dynamically adjusts the uncertainty threshold in the ASIA method, which changes the sampling frequency for avoiding premature death of nodes. Finally, the simulations show that, compared to the existing adaptive sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm not only saves about 36% of energy but also alleviates the imbalance of energy consumption in different parts of the tracking area.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879536","startPage":"68324","endPage":"68336","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08528403.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Target Tracking in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Target Tracking in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8528403/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528403/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61803328"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"F201703084"},{"fundingName":"Post-Doctoral Priority Funding of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"B2017003009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Target Tracking in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-yuan-2879536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091429S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8528403","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8528406,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Rahouti","affiliation":["Intelligent Computer Networking and Security Lab, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528406/rahou-2874539-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Rahouti received the M.S. degree in statistics from the University of South Florida in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol.

At the same time, millimeter-wave communications are able to provide directional multi-gigabit transmission rates with large available bandwidth. Based on the user mobile trajectories in a region, several activity hotspots that users pass by frequently can be obtained. By caching popular content at the edge nodes near the hotspots, users can download the cached content directly at a short distance, and the user experience can be significantly improved. Considering multiple hotspots in a region, how to efficiently schedule the transmission for the caching at edge nodes becomes a key problem. In this paper, we focus on the problem of mobility-aware transmission scheduling for caching at edge nodes near hotspots and utilize the multi-hop relaying and concurrent transmissions to achieve better performance. After formulating the optimal scheduling problem as a stochastic nonlinear mixed integer program, we propose a mobility-aware caching scheduling scheme, called Multi-Hop Relaying-based Caching, where multi-hop D2D paths are established for edge nodes, and concurrent transmissions are exploited in the scheduling of caching at edge nodes.

The explosive growth of mobile users and IoT applications injects massive traffic to the IoT network and also speeds up the drainage of sensor batteries. Caching at the IoT gateway (GW), which stores the IoT data and directly send them to the users, can avoid activating sensors too frequently, hence reducing the traffic in the IoT network as well as the energy consumption of sensors. To overcome the limited energy capacity of sensors, energy transmitters (ETs) are deployed to charge them. Practically, the GW and ETs may be owned by different operators, and the GW operator needs to incentivize ETs to provision the charging service. In this paper, we formulate a Stackelberg game in the cache-enabled energy harvesting aided IoT framework to improve the user quality of service. Caching strategies, incentive strategies, and ET transmission power strategies are jointly optimized to find the Stackelberg equilibrium by our proposed alternative direction approach. Simulation results elicit the benefits of our framework and demonstrate the performances of our proposed algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Energy harvesting","Quality

multiple-input multiple-output multiple-eavesdropper multicast network where a transmitter sends confidential information to multiple intended users and provides energy for multiple idle nodes while multiple passive eavesdroppers try to overhear the secret information. Supposing Gaussian CSI uncertainties, the proposed outage-constrained secrecy rate maximization (OC-SRM) problem is nonconvex and its analytical analysis is more challenging than several existing OC-SRM schemes. Technically, to circumvent this mathematically intractable secrecy problem, we resort to low SNR approximation and some conservative approximations (e.g., Bernstein-type inequality and sphere bounding) to reformulate the OC-SRM problem into two convex subproblems which can be efficiently solved by the off-the-shelf optimization solver. Simulation results are provided to validate the security performance of the robust AN-aided precoding design.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2018.2880439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8741121/08528432.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2018.2880439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8741121","startPage":"657","endPage":"660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Constrained Secrecy Rate Maximization for MIMOME Multicast Wiretap Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage Constrained Secrecy Rate Maximization for MIMOME Multicast Wiretap Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18757899","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8528432/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572114"},{"fundingName":"National Major Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2018YFB0904900 and 2018YFB0904905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Constrained Secrecy Rate Maximization for MIMOME Multicast Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"lwc-wen-2880439-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058284S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8741121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8741121","articleId":"8528432","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528435,"authors":[{"name":"Baoping Feng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528435/feng-2879376-small.gif","p":["Baoping Feng received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from Jilin University, China, in 2015.

We first introduce two key iterative strategies based on the PO relation of the synthetic channels. Then, we analyze the iteration process of the proposed method through a binary tree and a linear table structure and further derive the theoretical complexity of the proposed method. We validate the theoretical analysis through simulation results. Finally, considering the practical application, we propose a suboptimal simplified version of the proposed method to significantly reduce the complexity. Compared with the sorting method, the proposed simplified method needs only at most 10% of the comparison numbers in the process of the information set selection with negligible performance loss under the cyclic redundancy check-aided successive cancellation list decoding.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"67404","endPage":"67414","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879376","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08528435.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Method for Channel-Dependent Construction of Polar Codes Using Partial Order","topic":"Advances in Channel Coding for 5G and Beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528435/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Method for Channel-Dependent Construction of Polar Codes Using Partial Order","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","publicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8528435/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Low Complexity Method for Channel-Dependent Construction of Polar Codes Using Partial Order","sourcePdf":"access-feng-2879376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112589S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Advances in Channel Coding for 5G and Beyond"],"articleId":"8528435","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528453,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenling Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528453/wang-2876859-small.gif","p":["Zhenling Wang received the B.S. degree from the Information Engineering University of People\u2019s Liberation Army in 2009 and the M.S. degree from Henan Normal University in 2012.

The relay harvests energy from dedicated energy signal sent by a base station, while it reuses energy from loop self-interference (LI) signal. To characterize the performance of the system proposed, new expressions of exact and asymptotic outage probabilities for two users are derived. Based on analytical results, the diversity orders achieved by the nearby and distant user are one and two, respectively. We confirm that the diversity orders of the distant user are obtained with direct link and relaying link, since the energy from LI is harvested for information transmission at the relay. Numerical results are presented to validate the accuracy of the derived results and demonstrate that: 1) when the DF or AF protocol is employed, the outage behavior of the SRF-NOMA system is superior to orthogonal multiple access; 2) in the high signal-to-noise ratio region, DF relay in the SRF-NOMA system is capable of enhancing the outage performance compared to AF relay; and 3) the distant user in the SRF-NOMA system with QMF relay is able to obtain a better performance than that of DF and AF relays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528453/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8528453/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex User Relaying for NOMA System With Self-Energy Recycling","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Full-Duplex User Relaying for NOMA System With Self-Energy Recycling","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2876859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090657S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8528453","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528456,"authors":[{"name":"Yongbo Li","affiliation":["School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8528456/li-2873782-small.gif","p":["Yongbo Li (M\u201916) received the master\u2019s degree from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in general mechanics from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2017.

The fault diagnosis of rotating machines plays a vital important role to reduce the catastrophic failures and heavy economic loss. However, the measured vibration signal of rotating machinery often represents non-linear and non-stationary characteristics, resulting in difficulty in the fault feature extraction. As a statistical measure, entropy can quantify the complexity and detect dynamic change through taking into account the non-linear behavior of time series. Therefore, entropy can be served as a promising tool to extract the dynamic characteristics of rotating machines. Recently, many studies have applied entropy in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. This paper aims to investigate the applications of entropy for the fault characteristics extraction of rotating machines. First, various entropy methods are briefly introduced. Its foundation, application, and some improvements are described and discussed. The review is divided into eight parts: Shannon entropy, R\u00e9nyi entropy, approximate entropy, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, permutation entropy, and other entropy methods. In each part, we will review the applications using the original entropy method and the improved entropy methods, respectively.

A distributed optimization method typically consists of two key components: communication and computation. More specifically, at every iteration (or every several iterations) of a distributed algorithm, each node in the network requires some form of information exchange with its neighboring nodes (communication) and the computation step related to a (sub)-gradient (computation). The standard way of judging an algorithm via only the number of iterations overlooks the complexity associated with each iteration. Moreover, various applications deploying distributed methods may prefer a different composition of communication and computation. Motivated by this discrepancy, in this paper, we propose an adaptive cost framework that adjusts the cost measure depending on the features of various applications. We present a flexible algorithmic framework, where communication and computation steps are explicitly decomposed to enable algorithm customization for various applications. We apply this framework to the well-known distributed gradient descent (DGD) method, and show that the resulting customized algorithms, which we call DGD\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sup>\n, NEAR-DGD\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sup>\n, and NEAR-DGD\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n, compare favorably to their base algorithms, both theoretically and empirically.

We test the performance and illustrate the flexibility of the methods, as well as practical variants, on quadratic functions and classification problems that arise in machine learning, in terms of iterations, gradient evaluations, communications, and the proposed cost framework.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9/8777205/8528465-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","volume":"64","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18865838","htmlLink":"/document/8528465/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Balancing Communication and Computation in Distributed Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF-TRIPODS","grantNumber":"17-40796"},{"fundingName":"DARPA Lagrange Award","grantNumber":"HR-001117S0039"},{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-14-1-0313 P00003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Balancing Communication and Computation in Distributed Optimization","sourcePdf":"tac-wei-2880407-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182672S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"8777205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8777205","articleId":"8528465","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528469,"authors":[{"name":"Long Shi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Magnetic Suspension Technology and Maglev Vehicle, Ministry of Education, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0002-1605-6186","id":"37086298913"},{"name":"Haiquan Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Magnetic Suspension Technology and Maglev Vehicle, Ministry of Education, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0003-0198-1384","id":"37290335100"},{"name":"Yuriy Zakharov","affiliation":["University of York, York, U.K."],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Zakharov","orcid":"0000-0002-2193-4334","id":"37271562300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8528469","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":517},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Noise measurement","Heuristic algorithms","Complexity theory","Circuits and systems","Convergence","Microsoft Windows"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echo suppression","impulse noise","maximum entropy methods","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["squared deviation minimization","optimal kernel width","variable kernel width schemes","impulsive noise","maximum correntropy criterion algorithm","improved variable kernel width","MCC algorithm","background noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum correntropy criterion","variable kernel width","squared deviation","reset mechanism"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528469","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/9127218/08528469.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2880564","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2880564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9127218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Variable Kernel Width for Maximum Correntropy Criterion Algorithm","abstract":"The maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) algorithm has attracted much attention due to its capability of combating impulsive noise. However, its performance depends on choice of the kernel width, which is a hard issue. Several variable kernel width schemes based on various error functions have been proposed to address this problem. Nevertheless, these methods may not provide an optimal kernel width because they do not contain any knowledge of the background noise that actually has influence on the optimization of the kernel width. This brief proposes an improved variable kernel width MCC algorithm, which is derived by minimizing the squared deviation at each iteration. We also design a reset mechanism for the proposed algorithm to improve its tracking capability when the estimated vector encounters a sudden change. Simulations for system identification and echo cancellation scenarios show that the proposed scheme outperforms other variable kernel width algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","volume":"67","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"19728458","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2020","publicationDate":"July 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8528469/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Variable Kernel Width for Maximum Correntropy Criterion Algorithm","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571374, 61871461 and 61433011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/P017975/1 and EP/R003297/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Variable Kernel Width for Maximum Correntropy Criterion Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tcsii-zhao-2880564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096144S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"9127218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"9127218","articleId":"8528469","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528481,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Ulrich","affiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/8791032/8528481/ulric-2879549-small.gif","p":["Michael Ulrich received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and information technology in 2014 from the University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and information technology.","His research interests include radar signal processing, sensor fusion, and machine learning with application to radar."]},"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ulrich","orcid":"0000-0003-3186-5747","id":"37699980100"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/8791032/8528481/yang-2879549-small.gif","p":["Bin Yang received the Dipl.-Ing. and Ph.D. degrees in 1986 and 1991, respectively, from the Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany, both in electrical engineering.","He is a currently a Professor and the Head of the Institute for Signal Processing and System Theory with the Faculty of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.

Both metrics suggest that this phenomenon must be further handled.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of the Target Self-Interference in a Low-Complexity OFDM-Based Radar Receiver","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2018.2879534","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/8733227/08528501.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2018.2879534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8733227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","displayDocTitle":"Study of the Target Self-Interference in a Low-Complexity OFDM-Based Radar Receiver","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8528501/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18737036","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DGA/MRIS","grantNumber":"2017.60.0005"},{"fundingName":"Thales DMS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of the Target Self-Interference in a Low-Complexity OFDM-Based Radar Receiver","sourcePdf":"taes-mercier-2879534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148272S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8733227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8733227","articleId":"8528501","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528505,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Chin Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8635013/8528505/liao-2875311-small.gif","p":["Yen-Chin Liao received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in communication engineering in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering in 2008, all from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.","She was with ISSC Technology from 2002 to 2003, where she was involved in developing the IEEE802.11a/g products.

Experimental evidence suggests that the RED algorithms are a state of the art. We claim, however, that explicit regularization does not explain the RED algorithms. In particular, we show that many of the expressions in the paper by Romano et al. hold only when the denoiser has a symmetric Jacobian, and we demonstrate that such symmetry does not occur with practical denoisers such as nonlocal means, BM3D, TNRD, and DnCNN. To explain the RED algorithms, we propose a new framework called Score-Matching by Denoising (SMD), which aims to match a \u201cscore\u201d (i.e., the gradient of a log-prior). We then show tight connections between SMD, kernel density estimation, and constrained minimum mean-squared error denoising. Furthermore, we interpret the RED algorithms from Romano et al. and propose new algorithms with acceleration and convergence guarantees. Finally, we show that the RED algorithms seek a consensus equilibrium solution, which facilitates a comparison to plug-and-play ADMM.","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2018.2880326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2018.2880326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8637781","startPage":"52","endPage":"67","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8637781/08528509.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528509","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Jacobian matrices","Estimation","Imaging","Convergence","Optimization","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","image denoising","least mean squares methods","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["explicit regularization objective","plug-in image-denoising function","RED algorithms","error denoising","image-recovery framework","regularization by denoising","score-matching by denoising"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equilibrium methods","image denoising","image reconstruction","kernel density estimation","score matching"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6745852/8637781/8528509-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Regularization by Denoising: Clarifications and New Interpretations","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18629473","pubMedId":"31633003","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8528509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528509/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1527162 and CCF-1716388"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R01HL135489"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Regularization by Denoising: Clarifications and New Interpretations","sourcePdf":"tci-schniter-2880326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126739S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8637781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8637781","articleId":"8528509","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":8528513,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Ming Wang","affiliation":["Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Ministry of Education Key, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8528513/wang-2880216-small.gif","p":["Hui-Ming Wang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.

The full-duplex (FD) jamming receiver, which radiates jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers when receiving the desired signal simultaneously, is a promising candidate. Unlike existing endeavors that assume the FD jamming receiver always improves the secrecy performance compared with the half-duplex (HD) receiver, we show that this assumption highly depends on the instantaneous residual self-interference cancellation level and may be invalid. We propose an adaptive jamming receiver operating in a switched FD/HD mode for a D2D link in random networks. Subject to the secrecy outage probability constraint, we optimize the transceiver parameters, such as signal/jamming powers, secrecy rates, and mode switch criteria, to maximize the secrecy throughput.

With respect to the optimization problem, a new continuous-time coordination algorithm is proposed to compute its optimal solution in a distributed manner. The asymptotical convergence of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed by resorting to the direct sum decomposition technique, Kronecker matrix algebra, the stability of perturbed systems, and input-to-state stability.

We present a dynamic programming based algorithm for path balancing technology mapping, which generates optimal solutions for dc-biased SFQ (e.g., rapid SFQ or RSFQ) circuits with tree structure and acts as an effective heuristic for circuits with general directed acyclic graph structure. Experimental results show that our path balancing technology mapper reduces the balancing overhead by up to 2.7 \u00d7 and with an average of 21% compared to the state-of-the-art academic technology mappers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel7/77/8554353/08528520.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2018.2880343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2018.2880343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8554353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PBMap: A Path Balancing Technology Mapping Algorithm for Single Flux Quantum Logic Circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Clocks","Binary trees","Delays","Power transmission lines","CMOS technology","Josephson junctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","circuit optimisation","directed graphs","dynamic programming","logic circuits","quantum gates","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PBMap","Boolean network","SFQ circuits","dynamic programming based algorithm","general directed acyclic graph structure","tree structure","effective heuristic","dc-biased single flux quantum circuits","average logic level difference","mapping solution","single flux quantum logic circuits","path balancing technology mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficient","energy-efficient rapid single flux quantum (ERSFQ)","energy-efficient SFQ (eSFQ)","logic synthesis","low power","RSFQ","SFQ","superconducting electronics","technology mapping"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/77/8554353/8528520-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"PBMap: A Path Balancing Technology Mapping Algorithm for Single Flux Quantum Logic Circuits","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8528520/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18285341","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2018","externalId":"1300114","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity"},{"fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-17-1-0120"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"PBMap: A Path Balancing Technology Mapping Algorithm for Single Flux Quantum Logic Circuits","sourcePdf":"tasc-pasandi-2880343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127001S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"8554353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8554353","articleId":"8528520","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528524,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Wu","affiliation":["Optical Memory National Engineering Research Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8738884/8528524/swu-2876179-small.gif","p":["Shuang Wu received the B.E. degree in mechanical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2015.

However, BN brings in additional calculations, consumes more memory, and significantly slows down the training iteration. Furthermore, the nonlinear square and sqrt operations in the normalization process impede low bit-width quantization techniques, which draw much attention to the deep learning hardware community. In this paper, we propose an L1-norm BN (L1BN) with only linear operations in both forward and backward propagations during training. L1BN is approximately equivalent to the conventional L2-norm BN (L2BN) by multiplying a scaling factor that equals (\u03c0/2)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sup>\n. Experiments on various convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks reveal that L1BN can maintain the same performance and convergence rate as L2BN but with higher computational efficiency. In real application-specified integrated circuit synthesis with reduced resources, L1BN achieves 25% speedup and 37% energy saving compared to the original L2BN. Our hardware-friendly normalization method not only surpasses L2BN in speed but also simplifies the design of deep learning accelerators. Last but not least, L1BN promises a fully quantized training of DNNs, which empowers future artificial intelligence applications on mobile devices with transfer and continual learning capability.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5962385/8738884/8528524-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528524/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"18757937","pubMedId":"30418924","htmlLink":"/document/8528524/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","volume":"30","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Norm Batch Normalization for Efficient Training of Deep Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61327902, 61603209 and 61876215"},{"fundingName":"Suzhou-Tsinghua Innovation Leading Program","grantNumber":"2016SZ0102"},{"fundingName":"Brain-Science Special Program of Beijing","grantNumber":"Z181100001518006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1730309 and 1725447"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Norm Batch Normalization for Efficient Training of Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnnls-shi-2876179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124767S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8738884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8738884","articleId":"8528524","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528527,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8681658/8528527/xu-2879430-small.gif","p":["Jie Xu received the B.S. degree in automation from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2003, the M.S. degree in automation from the University of Besan\u00e7on, Besan\u00e7on, France, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in automatic system from the National Institute of Applied Sciences, Toulouse, France, in 2008.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

Environmental and operating conditions have been demonstrated to degrade DLDO performance, which directly affects execution accuracy. The area overhead (OH) needed to compensate aging-induced voltage noise degradation can be significant. Accordingly, in this paper, the algorithmic noise tolerance of certain processor components is exploited as an area-quality control knob to trade the program output quality for area OH. Furthermore, efficient and lightweight techniques utilizing a unidirectional shift register and reduced clock pulsewidth triggering are proposed to realize a novel aging-aware (AA) DLDO to achieve a better area and quality tradeoff. Owing to the large number and distributed nature of voltage regulators, with the proposed design, both the number of regulators utilized in the system and the size of each local regulator are scalable to satisfy the needs of different applications and processor components with varying algorithmic noise tolerance. It is demonstrated through simulation of an IBM POWER8 like processor that the proposed AA design can achieve up to, respectively, 43.2% and 3x transient and steady-state performance improvement. Additionally, more than 10% area OH saving can be achieved over a 5-year period.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/8595476/8528543-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"27","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18365353","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8528543/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Algorithmic Noise Tolerance for Scalable On-Chip Voltage Regulation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1350451"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation Award","grantNumber":"CCF-1421988"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004351","fundingName":"Cisco Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Exploiting Algorithmic Noise Tolerance for Scalable On-Chip Voltage Regulation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wang-2871381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17485S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8595476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8595476","articleId":"8528543","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528546,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Instrument Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yunxiang","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-9286-1881","id":"37086806152"},{"name":"Zhenguo Ma","affiliation":["Department of Instrument Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhenguo","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0002-7283-2637","id":"37085376860"},{"name":"Feng Yu","affiliation":["Department of Instrument Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Yu","orcid":"0000-0002-9740-2537","id":"38466920000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8528546","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528546","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Timing","Circuits and systems","Discrete cosine transforms","Complexity theory","Parallel architectures","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","matrix algebra","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identical cascaded basic circuits","modular architecture","matrix transposition","N \u00d7 N matrix","theoretical minimum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matrix transposition","modular architecture","permutation circuit","pipelined algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a novel pipelined algorithm for transposing an N \u00d7 N matrix, as well as a modular architecture for this algorithm.

Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process, the concise circuitry occupies a pad-included footprint of 850 \u03bcm \u00d7 450 \u03bcm and achieves a quiescent current consumption of 950 nA. To reduce the form factor, 401-457 MHz MedRadio-band is utilized to realize the induction link. The finalized assembly achieves one of the smallest dimensions (4.6 mm \u00d7 7.0 mm) for near-field IPGs with the Rx coil size of 4.5 mm \u00d7 3.6 mm. Codesign of the rectifier and Rx coil accommodates the possible resonant frequency drifts in biological tissues. In the benchtop measurement, a 430-MHz Tx coil is demonstrated to operate the IPG at 4.5 and 4 cm proximities in the air and through water, respectively. An in vivo experiment has been performed, in which the IPG was implanted on the hindlimb muscle belly of an anesthetized rat with the connective tissue and skin sutured. The electrical stimuli induced the isolated ankle flexion at specific strengths and rates, and the experiment complies with the specific absorption rate regulations.

The classical unmixing model, the linear mixing model (LMM), generally fails to handle this sticky issue effectively. To this end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented LMM, to address spectral variability by applying a data-driven learning strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing. The proposed approach models the main spectral variability (i.e., scaling factors) generated by variations in illumination or typography separately by means of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities caused by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity and atmospheric effects) and instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), and material nonlinear mixing effects, by introducing a spectral variability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning strategy, we also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability dictionary, whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures of endmembers, which leads to a well-known low-coherence dictionary learning problem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique is embedded in the framework of spectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability dictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2878958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2878958","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8548629/08528557.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8548629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Augmented Linear Mixing Model to Address Spectral Variability for Hyperspectral Unmixing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Augmented Linear Mixing Model to Address Spectral Variability for Hyperspectral Unmixing","volume":"28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","accessionNumber":"18320544","pubMedId":"30418901","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8528557/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program","grantNumber":"[ERC-2016-StG-714087] and Acronym: So2Sat"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009318","fundingName":"Helmholtz Association","grantNumber":"VH-NG-1018"},{"fundingName":"Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in the Framework of Junges Kolleg"},{"fundingName":"ANR ASTRID (Project APHYPIS)","grantNumber":"ANR-16-ASTR-0027-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"18K18067"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Augmented Linear Mixing Model to Address Spectral Variability for Hyperspectral Unmixing","sourcePdf":"tip-zhu-2878958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111222S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8548629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"8548629","articleId":"8528557","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528559,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Renaud","affiliation":["CEA-Leti Minatec, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8628286/8528559/renau-2876976-small.gif","p":["Guillaume Renaud received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019\u00c9lectronique, Informatique, T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Math\u00e9matique et M\u00e9canique de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France, in 2012 and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble-Alpes, Grenoble, France, in 2016, with a focus on the built-in-self-test of pipeline ADCs.","He is currently at the Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019Energie Atomique-Leti Minatec, Grenoble, France.

Based on the opinion that hardware is more secure and trustworthy, a trust platform module (TPM) is used as an external chip to ensure the trust verification, while it's unsuitable as virtual machine (VM) migration, hybrid servers, distributed storage with a low performance. So, we design a novel cloud architecture with a special physical server named as the trust verification server (TVS) to provide trust services according to the TPM specification, then the servers in the cloud can use TVS remotely as a high-performance TPM chip. In this paper, we design the TVS with accelerator hardware, upgrade the cloud architecture with an additional certificate authority (CA) server, and use TVS with a non-interference trust measurement model. The experiments show that the TVS can work efficiently with huge performance improvements at more than 100 times compared with the use of TPM in the cloud. This can be used to solve the complex cloud security problems such as VM sprawl and VM escape.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2020","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8528562/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2020","accessionNumber":"20072605","volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Trust Verification Architecture with Hardware Root for Secure Clouds","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701280"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2016FQ18"},{"fundingName":"Independent Innovation Engineering of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"2017CXGC0703"},{"fundingName":"Science & Technology Development Program of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"2017GGX10148"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trust Verification Architecture with Hardware Root for Secure Clouds","sourcePdf":"tsusc-dai-2880236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.262375S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7274860","isNumber":"9188049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274860","xplore-issue":"9188049","articleId":"8528562","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8528564,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Huzhou University, Huzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8781948/8528564/yang-2880458-small.gif","p":["Zhen Yang received the M.S. degree in computer application from the Faculty of Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China, in 2007.

To achieve this goal, many challenges remain to be addressed. Inspired from the cooperative mechanisms between multiple systems in the human being, this paper proposes a bio-inspired self-learning coevolutionary algorithm (BSCA) for dynamic multiobjective optimization of IoT services to reduce energy consumption and service time. BSCA consists of three layers. The first layer is composed of multiple subpopulations evolving cooperatively to obtain diverse Pareto fronts. Based on the solutions obtained by the first layer, the second layer aims to further increase the diversity of solutions. The third layer refines the solutions found in the second layer by adopting an adaptive gradient refinement search strategy and a dynamic optimization method to cope with changing concurrent multiple service requests, thereby effectively improving the accuracy of solutions. Experiments on agricultural IoT services in the presence of dynamic requests under different distributions are performed based on two service-providing strategies, i.e., single service and collaborative service. The simulation results demonstrate that BSCA performs better than four existing algorithms on IoT services, in particular for high-dimensional problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18867465","htmlLink":"/document/8528564/","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Self-Learning Coevolutionary Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm for Internet of Things Services","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"International Collaborative Project of the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"16510711100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473078, 61473077, 61503075 and 61603090"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Science and Technology Promotion Project from Shanghai Municipal Agriculture Commission","grantNumber":"2016-1-5-12"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars from the Ministry of Education (2015\u20132019)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-Inspired Self-Learning Coevolutionary Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm for Internet of Things Services","sourcePdf":"tevc-hao-2880458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150228S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8781948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8781948","articleId":"8528564","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528565,"authors":[{"name":"Chongyang Chen","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/9011772/8528565/chen-2876901-small.gif","p":["Chongyang Chen was born in 1995.

RSA has two main functions namely the process of encryption and decryption process. Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a digital signature algorithm that serves as the standard of Digital Signature Standard (DSS). DSA is also included in the public key cryptography system. DSA has two main functions of creating digital signatures and checking the validity of digital signatures. In this paper, the authors compare the computational times of RSA and DSA with some bits and choose which bits are better used. Then combine both RSA and DSA algorithms to improve data security. From the simulation results, the authors chose RSA 1024 for the encryption process and added digital signatures using DSA 512, so the messages sent are not only encrypted but also have digital

Modified Genetic Algorithm for Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio network (CRN) has a capability to sense the conditions of their operating environment. However, the resources allocation scheme is still inefficient because it is generated randomly and can lead to interference among the users. In this paper, we propose a modified genetic algorithm as a method for resource allocation in the cognitive radio network. In this work, the chromosome represents the channel interface index. The objective is to find the optimal resource allocation scheme of the nodes in the network in order to minimize the interference and maximize the network throughput. We have modified an encoding scheme and the fitness function of GA to assign the best channel combination of the cognitive radio network. The simulation results showed that the allocation channel using modified GA is capable of improving the network throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528587/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18249720","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","conferenceDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8528587/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Genetic Algorithm for Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Genetic Algorithm for Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"2018056_TS-056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048061S","chronDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510778","isNumber":"8528566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510778","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8528566","articleId":"8528587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8528591,"authors":[{"name":"Tince Etlin Tallo","affiliation":["Study Program of Master of Computer Science, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Tince Etlin","lastName":"Tallo","id":"37086512493"},{"name":"Aina Musdholifah","affiliation":["Department Computer Science and Electronics, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Aina","lastName":"Musdholifah","id":"37548044000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5813-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5812-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5814-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8528591","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":652},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528591","abstract":"An imbalanced dataset is a condition that has a minority class which is a class has far fewer instance distributions than other classes. The imbalanced condition can affect the performance of standard classifier algorithms that lead to the biased of the results classification or tend to become a majority class. The SMOTE method overcomes the imbalanced masses by creating synthetic instances of minority classes. However, the implementation of SMOTE resulted in overgeneralization because generated instances have the same amount regardless of the distribution of instances. As a result, the boundaries between classes are unclear. The SMOTE-Simple Genetic Algorithm (SMOTE-SGA) method is used to determine the sampling rate of each instance in order to obtain unequal amounts of synthetic instances. The tests were performed using some imbalanced datasets by comparing the classification results measured using G-means and F-Measure. The results of the application of genetic algorithm at SMOTE can improve the classification result by obtaining better G-means and F-measure value.","doi":"10.1109/ICSTC.2018.8528591","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Science and Technology (ICST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510778/8528566/08528591.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Science and Technology (ICST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTC.2018.8528591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8528566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Implementation of Genetic Algorithm in Smote (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for Handling Imbalanced Dataset Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Diabetes","Classification algorithms","Biological cells","Sociology","Statistics","Wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["majority class","imbalanced masses","SMOTE-SGA","synthetic minority oversampling technique","fewer instance distributions","imbalanced condition","standard classifier algorithms","handling imbalanced dataset problem","SMOTE-simple genetic algorithm method","sampling rate","G-means","F-measure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imbalanced dataset","classification","SMOTE","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"The Implementation of Genetic Algorithm in Smote (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for Handling Imbalanced Dataset Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8528591/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","conferenceDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18233755","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Implementation of Genetic Algorithm in Smote (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for Handling Imbalanced Dataset Problem","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"2018051_TS-051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045702S","chronDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510778","isNumber":"8528566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510778","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8528566","articleId":"8528591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8528611,"authors":[{"name":"A.A Pramudita","affiliation":["Telecommunication Engineering Dept., Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"A.A","lastName":"Pramudita"},{"name":"Sholihin","affiliation":["Politeknik Negeri Sriwijaya, Palembang, Sumatera Selatan, ID"],"lastName":"Sholihin"},{"name":"Dyonisius Dony Ariananda","affiliation":["Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakart, ID"],"firstName":"Dyonisius Dony","lastName":"Ariananda"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5813-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5812-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5814-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8528611","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","MIMO communication","Microstrip antenna arrays","Microstrip","Mutual coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circularly polarized microstrip antennas","MIMO antennas","IEEE 802.11ac MIMO WLAN system","antenna design","left-hand circular polarizations","antenna element","antennas configuration","right-hand circular polarizations","bandwidth 480.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular polarization","microstrip","MIMO","antenna"]}],"abstract":"An array of eight circularly polarized microstrip antennas is proposed as MIMO antennas for IEEE 802.11ac MIMO WLAN system.

This array of antennas having two different polarization has been investigated. The results show that setting the adjacent elements with different polarizations, such as right-hand and left-hand circular polarizations, allows the suppression of the mutual coupling between antennas.

In this paper, we proposed the solution of resource allocation for cognitive radio network using the modified Ant Colony Algorithm - a metaheuristic approximation inspired from the behavior of the colony of ants in foraging. Our proposed solution relies on the pheromone intensity in the path used by ants to make decision of the channel selection.

Maintaining security, data confidentiality, and data integrity are the primary goals of the NIDS. In this way, this paper investigates the application and performance of machine learning algorithms in NIDS. Four algorithms namely, Random Forest, Decision Stump, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) combined with different feature selection techniques (Correlation Ranking Filter and Gain Ratio Feature Evaluator) are applied to implement the NIDS models using the NSL-KDD dataset which is the new version of KDD-Cup99.

in the planning and operation of power systems. The purpose of load forecasting is to balance the demand and electricity supply. The electrical load is dynamic, changing over the time. The provision of electrical energy is also dynamic following the pattern of load changes. Load forecasting is required to ensure an accurate decision on power plant scheduling, unit commitment, and power delivery. This paper presents a recurrent neural network (RNN) model with Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian regularization training algorithms used for short-term electrical load forecasting. The accuracy criterion used is Mean Absolute Percentage of Error (MAPE). The results show that the RNN model can make good predictions. RNN model with the Bayesian regularization training algorithm has better accuracy. Its average MAPE in one week is 1,4792%. It implies that the RNN model is great tool for STLF.","doi":"10.1109/ICSTC.2018.8528651","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Science and Technology (ICST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTC.2018.8528651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8528566","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Science and Technology (ICST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510778/8528566/08528651.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Electric Load Forecasting Using Recurrent Neural Network (Study Case of Load Forecasting in Central Java and Special Region of Yogyakarta)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528651/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Electric Load Forecasting Using Recurrent Neural Network (Study Case of Load Forecasting in Central Java and Special Region of Yogyakarta)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8528651/","accessionNumber":"18233716","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","conferenceDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Electric Load Forecasting Using Recurrent Neural Network (Study Case of Load Forecasting in Central Java and Special Region of Yogyakarta)","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"2018133_TS-133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057083S","chronDate":"7-8 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510778","isNumber":"8528566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510778","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8528566","articleId":"8528651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8528655,"authors":[{"name":"Budi Cahyo Suryo Putro S","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Budi Cahyo","lastName":"Suryo Putro S","id":"37086510499"},{"name":"I Wayan Mustika","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"I Wayan","lastName":"Mustika","id":"37704406600"},{"name":"Lukito Edi Nugroho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Lukito Edi","lastName":"Nugroho","id":"37872425800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5813-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5812-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5814-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8528655","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":544},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528655","abstract":"Agriculture is a very important sector in building the national economy.

Given a number of destinations to be visited by a traveler, his/her accommodation location, the duration of his/her visit, and some constraints for each destination, a travel plan application is expected to create a schedule for visiting the chosen destinations. Determining such a schedule manually is a tedious and time-consuming task due to the algorithm complexity which falls in O(n!) if the problem is to be solved by using brute force approach. In this research, the problem is treated as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) and solved using genetic algorithm (GA), which has been widely known to be capable of solving combinatorial problems. However, to employ GA in travel planning, there are challenges in determining the appropriate fitness model and its parameters. To this end, this research performs two experiment scenarios. The first scenario is to compare multi-level GA to single-level GA in solving the problem and to define the optimal parameters. We found that the multi-level GA obtains 108 minutes less trip duration. The second scenario is to evaluate the solution found by the multi-level GA. The trip duration is very close to the solution of brute force approach, with only 1 minute different, but with significantly faster processing time by 50 seconds compared to 20 minutes. These results confirm that our multi-level GA implementation is proven to be applicable for the problem of generating travel plan.","doi":"10.1109/ICoICT.2018.8528813","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509820/8528718/08528813.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"91","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 6th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)","publicationTitle":"2018 6th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoICT.2018.8528813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8528718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Level Genetic Algorithm Approach for Generating Efficient Travel Plans","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Level Genetic Algorithm Approach for Generating Efficient Travel Plans","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18233351","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8528813/","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Level Genetic Algorithm Approach for Generating Efficient Travel Plans","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p86-hendra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060829S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509820","isNumber":"8528718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509820","xplore-issue":"8528718","articleId":"8528813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8528814,"authors":[{"name":"Fajari Arief Setia","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Syiah Kuala University, Darussalam, Banda Aceh, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Fajari Arief","lastName":"Setia","id":"37086510151"},{"name":"Teuku Yuliar Arif","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Syiah Kuala University, Darussalam, Banda Aceh, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Teuku Yuliar","lastName":"Arif","id":"38666425700"},{"name":"Rizal Munadi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Syiah Kuala University, Darussalam, Banda Aceh, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Rizal","lastName":"Munadi","id":"37886063700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4572-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4571-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4573-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8528814","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528814","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11n Standard","Wireless LAN","Throughput","Data models","Heuristic algorithms","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","smart phones","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PHY rate","channel conditions","aggregate-MPDU","multiple MAC protocol data units","medium access control 802.11n","collision-aware rate adaptation algorithm","CARA-HT algorithm","PHY 802.11n capabilities","collision error","high-throughput WLAN","Minstrel-HT","physical 802.11n transmits MPDU","A-MPDU","modern smartphones","High-throughput IEEE 802.11n"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collision-Aware","Rate Adaptation","CARA-HT","High Throughput","802.11n"]}],"abstract":"IEEE 802.11n Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is the default standard that is used on modern smartphones and modern PCs/laptops. Medium Access Control (MAC) 802.11n has the capability of transmitting multiple MAC Protocol Data Units (MPDUs) into an Aggregate-MPDU (A-MPDU). Physical (PHY) 802.11n transmits MPDU or A-MPDU using a PHY rate of 6.5 to 600 Mbps determined by the rate adaptation algorithm. The selected PHY rate is expected according to the channel conditions for MPDU to be received without error. Based on the literature study, Minstrel-HT is one of the rate adaptation algorithms based on proposed channel conditions, especially for IEEE 802.11n high-throughput WLAN. However Minstrel-HT does not have a mechanism to activate RTS/CTS mode dynamically in the event of a collision error. Collision-aware rate adaptation (CARA) has been proposed, however the design has been made not for WLAN high throughput. In this paper we improve CARA to take advantage of MAC and PHY 802.11n capabilities and call it CARA for High Throughput (CARA-HT). We developed the CARA-HT algorithm in NS-3.26 simulator. The simulation results show the throughput produced by CARA-HT is better than Minstrel-HT.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8528718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoICT.2018.8528814","publicationTitle":"2018 6th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 6th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509820/8528718/08528814.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","doi":"10.1109/ICoICT.2018.8528814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collision-Aware Rate Adaptation Algorithm for High-Throughput IEEE 802.11n WLANs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Collision-Aware Rate Adaptation Algorithm for High-Throughput IEEE 802.11n WLANs","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8528814/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18249454","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528814/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collision-Aware Rate Adaptation Algorithm for High-Throughput IEEE 802.11n WLANs","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p12-setia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051922S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509820","isNumber":"8528718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509820","xplore-issue":"8528718","articleId":"8528814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8528820,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Schrenk","affiliation":["Austrian Institute of Technology, Center for Digital Safety & Security, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Bernhard Schrenk (S\u201910\u2013M\u201911) was born in Austria in 1982.

In this work, we propose a disruptive approach: the re-use of widely deployed direct-detection technology for simultaneous coherent homodyne reception and transmission. We first show that an externally modulated laser (EML) is sufficient to perform both, coherent reception and transmission functionality. Second, we prove that homodyne detection applies to the EML-based scheme in virtue of an injection-locked local oscillator, which for low input power levels is pulled to the optical carrier frequency of the incident data signal. The proposed methodology for coherent reception enables a greatly simplified transceiver as optical layer hardware. As we will demonstrate, it just requires single fiber access, a single radio frequency port, and can be implemented in a transistor-outline package. Full-duplex transmission with coherent homodyne reception is experimentally validated, showing 2.5 Gb/s transmission over 27.5 km reach and a loss budget of 28 dB, and coherent Gigabit Ethernet connectivity-without the use of optical layer digital signal processing functions.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2879435","startPage":"555","endPage":"561","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2879435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643941","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8643941/08528820.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coherent Homodyne TO-Can Transceiver as Simple as an EML","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528820/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Coherent Homodyne TO-Can Transceiver as Simple as an EML","volume":"37","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8528820/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18470714","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG through the TRITON","grantNumber":"858697"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coherent Homodyne TO-Can Transceiver as Simple as an EML","sourcePdf":"jlt-schrenk-2879435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121083S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8643941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8643941","articleId":"8528820","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":8528825,"authors":[{"name":"Run-Ling Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Run-Ling","lastName":"Li","id":"37086368595"},{"name":"Lin-Lin Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lin-Lin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085457926"},{"name":"Yu-Long Jiang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Long","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0001-8521-5075","id":"37279389100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"8528825","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Transistors","MOSFET circuits","Random access memory","Logic gates","Silicon germanium","Atomic layer deposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["germanium compounds","Ge-Si alloys","MOSFET","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["localized high content","Ge penetration","PMOSFET channel","Ge atoms","embedded SiGe source-drain","SRAM","positive threshold voltage shift","hydrogen radicals","eSiGe deposition","SiGe cap layer deposition","size 28 nm","SiGe","GeH4"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Threshold voltage shift","embedded SiGe","Ge penetration","PMOSFET"]}],"abstract":"A significant positive threshold voltage shift for the PMOSFET of a 28-nm SRAM is reported in this letter.

It is possible to extend CNNs to three dimensions using 3-D kernels to make them suitable for volumetric medical imaging data such as CT or MRI, but this increases the processing time as well as the required number of training samples (due to the higher number of parameters that need to be learned). In this paper, we address both of these issues for a 3-D CNN implementation through the development of a two-stage computer-aided detection system for automatic detection of pulmonary nodules. The first stage consists of a 3-D fully convolutional network for fast screening and generation of candidate suspicious regions. The second stage consists of an ensemble of 3-D CNNs trained using extensive transformations applied to both the positive and negative patches to augment the training set. To enable the second stage classifiers to learn differently, they are trained on false positive patches obtained from the screening model using different thresholds on their associated scores as well as different augmentation types. The networks in the second stage are averaged together to produce the final classification score for each candidate patch. Using this procedure, our overall nodule detection system called DeepMed is fast and can achieve 91% sensitivity at 2 false positives per scan on cases from the LIDC dataset.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Detection of Pulmonary Nodules in Chest CT","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2018.2879449","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2018.2879449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8824156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8824156/08528826.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","displayDocTitle":"3-D Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Detection of Pulmonary Nodules in Chest CT","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8528826/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18973556","pubMedId":"30418929","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Detection of Pulmonary Nodules in Chest CT","sourcePdf":"jbhi-pezeshk-2879449-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158206S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8824156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8824156","articleId":"8528826","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528830,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Dasgupta","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8580626/8528830/dasgu-2876473-small.gif","p":["Kaushik Dasgupta (S\u201909\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electronics and electrical communication engineering from IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India, in 2008, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.","From 2006 to 2007, he was a Research Intern with the System on Chip Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

This paper utilizes orthogonal pol modes to support simultaneous independent data streams on the same frequency channel, thereby doubling the effective channel capacity.

At these multi-Gb/s rates, multi-path ISI and cross-pol effects limit the feasibility of DP-MIMO. To mitigate these channel effects, a mixed-signal 384-coefficient feed-forward equalizer (FFE)- and 2400-coefficient decision-feedback equalizer (DFE)-based areaand energy-efficient RX baseband is also presented. The baseband supports DP-MIMO up to 40 Gb/s for line-of-sight (LOS) 16QAM and 14 Gb/s non-line-of-sight (NLOS) QPSK, at 3\u00d7 to 38\u00d7 better energy efficiency per coefficient than state of the art.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/8580626/08528830.pdf","startPage":"3613","endPage":"3627","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2018.2876473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2018.2876473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8580626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60-GHz Transceiver and Baseband With Polarization MIMO in 28-nm CMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Transceivers","MIMO communication","Baseband","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","channel capacity","CMOS integrated circuits","decision feedback equalisers","equalisers","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","millimetre wave receivers","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TX-RX chains","over-the-air quadrature-amplitude modulation dual-pol-multiplexing-based multiinput and multioutput","2\u00d7 higher communicated bits-symbol","CMOS technology","single-pol transceiver","single printed circuit board antenna","energy-efficient 60-GHz transceiver prototype","effective channel capacity","frequency channel","simultaneous independent data streams","orthogonal pol modes","channel diversity","modern RF transceivers","polarization selectivity","polarization MIMO","energy efficiency","line-of-sight 16QAM","energy-efficient RX baseband","mixed-signal 384-coefficient feed-forward","channel effects","DP-MIMO","cross-pol effects","multipath ISI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60-GHz transceiver","CMOS","dual polarization (DP)","millimeter wave","multi-input and multi-output (MIMO)","over the air (OTA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A 60-GHz Transceiver and Baseband With Polarization MIMO in 28-nm CMOS","volume":"53","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8528830/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18365028","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60-GHz Transceiver and Baseband With Polarization MIMO in 28-nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-dasgupta-2876473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097381S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8580626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8580626","articleId":"8528830","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528831,"authors":[{"name":"Sercan \u00d6.

The proposed method is based on sparse representation that is from the coupled dictionaries (DL-IN). The used dictionary pairs in this paper are jointly optimized from paired face images with normal and irregular illuminations. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering was further used to improve the capability of modeling data with more complex distributions. The proposed GMM adapts individual model based on a portion of the samples and lastly fuses all the images together. Experimental results show that the proposed framework by jointly optimizing DL and incorporating structural sparsity as a prior can improve the accuracy for face

using an acoustic room simulator. We point out several limitations of enhancement methods relying on clean speech targets; the goal of this letter is to propose an alternative learning algorithm, called acoustic and adversarial supervision (AAS). AAS makes the enhanced output both maximizing the likelihood of transcription on the pre-trained acoustic model and having general characteristics of clean speech, which improve generalization on unseen noisy speeches. We employ the connectionist temporal classification and the unpaired conditional boundary equilibrium generative adversarial network as the loss function of AAS. AAS is tested on two datasets including additive noise without and with reverberation, Librispeech + DEMAND, and CHiME-4. By visualizing the enhanced speech with different loss combinations, we demonstrate the role of each supervision. AAS achieves a lower word error rate than other state-of-the-art methods using the clean speech target in both datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528843/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18279141","htmlLink":"/document/8528843/","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unpaired Speech Enhancement by Acoustic and Adversarial Supervision for Speech Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program","grantNumber":"10076757"},{"fundingName":"Free-Running Embedded Speech Recognition Technology for Natural Language Dialogue with Robots"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE, South Korea)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unpaired Speech Enhancement by Acoustic and Adversarial Supervision for Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"lsp-lee-2880285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070328S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8539853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8539853","articleId":"8528843","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528847,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-2777-7915","id":"37311410000"},{"name":"Xiaoding Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoding","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086619015"},{"name":"Li ping Qian","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li ping","lastName":"Qian","orcid":"0000-0001-6210-2617","id":"38236005500"},{"name":"Kejie Ni","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kejie","lastName":"Ni","id":"37086553167"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8528847","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","NOMA","Bandwidth","Downlink","Power demand","Optimization","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","concave programming","mobile computing","multi-access systems","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["base station","RUE","total power consumption","nonconvexity","joint optimization problem","resource-efficient NOMA transmission","downlink nonorthogonal multiple access","three-layered vertical decomposition","BS utility","mobile terminals traffic","resource utilization efficiency maximization","joint channel bandwidth allocation","joint rate allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","resource allocation","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528847","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8638657/08528847.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2879945","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2879945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8638657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource-Efficient NOMA Transmission via Joint Bandwidth and Rate Allocations","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the joint channel bandwidth and rate allocations for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access with the objective of maximizing the resource utilization efficiency (RUE).

The architecture of this converter employs a single 2.5-V voltage reference and an unbalanced buffering technique to achieve a wide voltage range that extends from 864 mV to 2.538 V with an 8-bit resolution. The proposed converter incorporates a defect-tolerant architecture and is extremely compact, utilizing a per-bit silicon area of less than 350 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. Although such very small area allows for embedding in dense configurable fabrics (field-programmable gate arrays) and wafer-scale integration, the overall performance is not sacrificed as reported measurements show a signal-tonoise ratio of 51.87 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range of 42.31 dB, at 10 MS/s providing 7.6 effective bits. Moreover, the proposed architecture benefits from dynamic calibration capabilities, as any converter output can be finely adjusted over a range of 25 mV. This proposed DAC is also extensively reused in the same defect-tolerant network for a successive approximation register-analog-to-digital converter, as well as for a configurable voltage reference.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2876458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8628286/08528858.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2876458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Defect-Tolerant Reusable Network of DACs for Wafer-Scale Integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Defect-Tolerant Reusable Network of DACs for Wafer-Scale Integration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528858/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18439131","htmlLink":"/document/8528858/","volume":"27","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003151","fundingName":"Fonds de Recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Nature et Technologies"},{"fundingName":"PROMPT"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004489","fundingName":"Mitacs"},{"fundingName":"Gestion TechnoCap Inc"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Defect-Tolerant Reusable Network of DACs for Wafer-Scale Integration","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-laflammemayer-2876458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11164S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8628286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"8628286","articleId":"8528858","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528859,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/8720290/8528859/li-2880604-small.gif","p":["Jie Li received the B.S. degree in network engineering from Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in computer software and theory, in 2015, from Yunnan University, Kunming, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering.

Nevertheless, synthesizing structured textures remains a challenging task. Most previous methods rely on additional guidance channels, which encode the structured features of textures. However, estimating the guidance channel is very difficult, and often fails when a texture has unpronounced features. In this paper, we propose a novel texture synthesis method, based on non-local operators, which captures the long-range structure of a texture without the additional guidance channel. The synthesized texture is generated by minimizing non-local texture energy through an expectation-maximization like optimization algorithm. A statistical constraint based on the Wasserstein distance is also proposed to ensure that the synthesized texture preserves the global statistics of the exemplar texture. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can stably handle textures with different scale structures.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/8720290/08528859.pdf","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Local Texture Optimization With Wasserstein Regularization Under Convolutional Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2018.2880604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8720290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2018.2880604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","displayDocTitle":"Non-Local Texture Optimization With Wasserstein Regularization Under Convolutional Neural Network","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18692057","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8528859/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61163019 and 61540062"},{"fundingName":"Key Research Foundation of Yunnan Province","grantNumber":"2014FA021"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Fund"},{"fundingName":"Industrialization Cultivation Project of Yunnan Provincial Education Department","grantNumber":"2016CYH03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"LP170100458"},{"fundingName":"Research Innovation Fund for Graduate Students of Yunnan University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Local Texture Optimization With Wasserstein Regularization Under Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tmm-xu-2880604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133465S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8720290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","xplore-issue":"8720290","articleId":"8528859","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528870,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Wu","affiliation":["Adaptive Networks and Control Lab"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6509490/8723050/8528870/wu-2880299-small.gif","p":["Jie Wu received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Hainan Normal University, Haikou, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in mathematics from China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2015.

Given a target fairness (measured in terms of the ratio between the information rates of low versus high resolution stream), the operator seeks to optimize the modulation and coding schemes so as to maximize the average cell throughput. Viewing operating points as fairness-throughput pairs allows to meaningfully quantify and interpret the superiority of non-orthogonal multiple access techniques such as superposition coding against simple orthogonal time division. The optimal fairness-throughput tradeoff curve for superposition coding versus time division is derived in the Gaussian setting. A practical implementation with 16-QAM constellations and multilevel coding is proposed and its tradeoff curve is numerically evaluated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/8658207/08528872.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2018.2876807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2018.2876807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8658207","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fairness\u2013Throughput Tradeoff Perspective on NOMA Multiresolution Broadcasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Encoding","Quality of service","Broadcasting","Throughput","Receivers","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","encoding","multicast communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","satellite communication","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fairness-throughput tradeoff perspective","NOMA multiresolution broadcasting","cellular satellite downlink","multicast information","resolution levels","information rates","coding schemes","average cell throughput","viewing operating points","nonorthogonal multiple access techniques","superposition coding","multilevel coding","modulation schemes","optimal fairness-throughput tradeoff curve","orthogonal time division","fairness-throughput pairs","16-QAM constellations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast","multiresolution","multilevel coding","fairness","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","orthogonal multiple access (OMA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Fairness\u2013Throughput Tradeoff Perspective on NOMA Multiresolution Broadcasting","volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8528872/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18501777","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Catalan Government","grantNumber":"2017 SGR 1479"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad","grantNumber":"TEC2014-59255-C3-1-R (ELISA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fairness\u2013Throughput Tradeoff Perspective on NOMA Multiresolution Broadcasting","sourcePdf":"tbc-pastore-2876807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079257S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"8658207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8658207","articleId":"8528872","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8528875,"authors":[{"name":"Charlotte Frenkel","affiliation":["ICTEAM Institute, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/8626744/8528875/frenk-2880425-small.gif","p":["Charlotte Frenkel (S\u201915) received the M.Sc.

Exploring roads toward cognitive SNNs requires the design of compact, low-power and versatile experimentation platforms with the key requirement of online learning in order to adapt and learn new features in uncontrolled environments. However, embedding online learning in SNNs is currently hindered by high incurred complexity and area overheads. In this paper, we present ODIN, a 0.086-mm2 64k-synapse 256-neuron online-learning digital spiking neuromorphic processor in 28-nm FDSOI CMOS achieving a minimum energy per synaptic operation (SOP) of 12.7 pJ. It leverages an efficient implementation of the spike-driven synaptic plasticity (SDSP) learning rule for high-density embedded online learning with only 0.68 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n per 4-bit synapse. Neurons can be independently configured as a standard leaky integrate-and-fire model or as a custom phenomenological model that emulates the 20 Izhikevich behaviors found in biological spiking neurons. Using a single presentation of 6 k 16 \u00d7 16 MNIST training images to a single-layer fully connected 10-neuron network with on-chip SDSP-based learning, ODIN achieves a classification accuracy of 84.5%, while consuming only 15 nJ/inference at 0.55 V using rank order coding. ODIN thus enables further developments toward cognitive neuromorphic devices for low-power, adaptive and low-cost processing.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2880425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/8626744/08528875.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8626744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2880425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.086-mm- 12.7-pJ/SOP 64k-Synapse 256-Neuron Online-Learning Digital Spiking Neuromorphic Processor in 28-nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A 0.086-mm<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^2$</tex-math></inline-formula> 12.7-pJ/SOP 64k-Synapse 256-Neuron Online-Learning Digital Spiking Neuromorphic Processor in 28-nm CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528875/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18413831","pubMedId":"30418919","htmlLink":"/document/8528875/","volume":"13","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Foundation for Scientific Research of Belgium"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.086-mm<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^2$</tex-math></inline-formula> 12.7-pJ/SOP 64k-Synapse 256-Neuron Online-Learning Digital Spiking Neuromorphic Processor in 28-nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"tbcas-frenkel-2880425-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116162S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8626744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8626744","articleId":"8528875","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528883,"authors":[{"name":"Anindita Paul","affiliation":["Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8628286/8528883/paul-2878017-small.gif","p":["Anindita Paul(S\u201916) was born in Chinsurah, India.

Most of these studies consider time-division duplexing and a fixed number of users. To fill the gap in the literature, we analyze the MRC-MRT precoder performance of an N-antenna AF massive MIMO TWR, which operates in a frequency-division duplex mode to enable two-way communication between 2M = [N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b1</sup>\n] single-antenna users, with \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1), divided equally into two groups of M users. We assume that the relay has realistic imperfect uplink channel state information (CSI), and that quantized downlink CSI is fed back by the users relying on B \u2265 1 bits per-user per relay antenna. We prove that for such a system with \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1), the MRC-MRT precoder asymptotically cancels the multi-user interference (MUI) when the supremum and infimum of large-scale fading parameters are strictly nonzero and finite, respectively. Furthermore, its per-user pairwise error probability converges to that of an equivalent AWGN channel, as both N and the number of users 2M = [N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b1</sup>\n] tend to infinity, with a relay power scaling of P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n = (2ME\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n/N) and E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n being a constant.

Finally, we show that the analysis developed herein to derive a bound on \u03b1 for MUI cancellation is applicable both to Gaussian as well as to any arbitrary non-Gaussian complex channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2879931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2879931","startPage":"988","endPage":"1003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08528886.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Quantized MRC-MRT Precoder For FDD Massive MIMO Two-Way AF Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8528886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Quantized MRC-MRT Precoder For FDD Massive MIMO Two-Way AF Relaying","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18467843","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8528886/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008628","fundingName":"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/PO34284/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analysis of Quantized MRC-MRT Precoder For FDD Massive MIMO Two-Way AF Relaying","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-2879931-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.265124S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8528886","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8528894,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Data Science Research Center, Duke Kunshan University, Kunshan, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-6406-1983","id":"37088229091"},{"name":"Hao Xu","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0001-7759-2620","id":"37088876080"},{"name":"Xingchang Huang","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xingchang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088875065"},{"name":"Zhanmei Song","affiliation":["School of Preschool Education, Shandong Yingcai University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Zhanmei","lastName":"Song","id":"37086407185"},{"name":"Xiaolin Liu","affiliation":["School of Preschool Education, Shandong Yingcai University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086408859"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["School of Preschool Education, Shandong Yingcai University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-4510-2436","id":"37086409699"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3045"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9850"}],"articleNumber":"8528894","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":772},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8528894","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Learning data","Transfer learning","Feature extraction","Convolution","Emotion recognition","Training data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Facial expression recognition","emotion recognition","face recognition","joint learning","transfer learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAFFC.2018.2880201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165369/9443045/08528894.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2018.2880201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9443045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Expression Recognition with Identity and Emotion Joint Learning","abstract":"Different subjects may express a specific expression in different ways due to inter-subject variabilities.

First, we learn the emotion and identity features separately using two different CNNs with their corresponding training data. Second, we concatenate these two features together as a deep-learned Tandem Facial Expression (TFE) Feature and feed it to the subsequent fully connected layers to form a new model. Finally, we perform joint learning on the newly merged network using only the facial expression training data.

It is necessary to maintain security for images such as medical, military, etc. So far many research work have been developed in the field of image information security and prevention. However the achieved level of security is not satisfactory, thus still this field is in research to find a better solution for the image data security and prevention. In this sense, this research is targeted to develop a better strategy for the image data prevention and security enhancement. There are many cryptography technique is available in the technical world, however this work adapted quaternion based approach for the image data security. Qua-ternion is a kind of number notation, it is the combination of both scalar and vector. Quaternion rotation is the concept applied in the image encryption for the security purpose. In the existing works authors have applied the Quaternion rotation based encryption of medical image and color images. In order to further enhance the performance of encryption, in this work the Quaternion Fourier Transform is applied. The Fourier transform based Quaternion rotation improves the performance in both security and computation. The proposed system is implemented using the working platform of MATLAB, and the performance is compared with the conventional quaternion technique. The proposed system provided better performance based on the comparative analysis with respect to correlation coefficient, avalanche effect, computational speed, normalized correlation and histogram.","doi":"10.1109/ICETIETR.2018.8529014","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Emerging Trends and Innovations In Engineering And Technological Research (ICETIETR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Emerging Trends and Innovations In Engineering And Technological Research (ICETIETR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510758/8528998/08529014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETIETR.2018.8529014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8528998","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach for Image Encryption / Decryption Based on Quaternion Fourier Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Approach for Image Encryption / Decryption Based on Quaternion Fourier Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529014/","conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18249662","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8529014/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach for Image Encryption / Decryption Based on Quaternion Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Ernakulam, India","sourcePdf":"104ICETIETR18_295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076905S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510758","isNumber":"8528998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510758","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8528998","articleId":"8529014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8529081,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Gliomas are the most aggressive brain tumor. Gliomas generally growby diffuse infiltration in to the inner portion of the brain and these are therefore often not directly visible on the brain surface. The efficient treatment planning and detection is the way to improve the condition of oncological patients. The established technique is to detect the gliomas by the method of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Manual segmentation takes reasonable time since large number of data generated by MRI have to be processed. For accurate segmentation, a novel completely automatic and reliable segmentation based on CNN is proposed. The 3\u00d73 kernels provide a positive effect against over fitting. In pre-processing step, intensity normalization, which is not normally used in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is applied in this work. For applications like keyhole and the Nano robotic surgery it is beneficial to have correct edges of the particular tumor. Canny edge detection and edge detection using wavelet transform methods were performed on the image. Using PCNN method Image enhancement is done. The edge detection with image enhancement will lead to a wide variety of surgical applications in medical field.","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Emerging Trends and Innovations In Engineering And Technological Research (ICETIETR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Emerging Trends and Innovations In Engineering And Technological Research (ICETIETR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510758/8528998/08529081.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of Brain Tumor in MRI Images Using CNN with Edge Detection","doi":"10.1109/ICETIETR.2018.8529081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8528998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETIETR.2018.8529081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2018","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of Brain Tumor in MRI Images Using CNN with Edge Detection","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18263084","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8529081/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of Brain Tumor in MRI Images Using CNN with Edge Detection","confLoc":"Ernakulam, India","sourcePdf":"44ICETIETR18_153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039846S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510758","isNumber":"8528998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510758","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8528998","articleId":"8529081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8529097,"authors":[{"name":"Shabna Nasser","affiliation":["Calpine Labs, Govt Engg.

Social media makes use of a wide range of figurative languages. Among them Simile, Sarcasm, Irony and humor are mostly used. Simile essentially compares two different things and often occur in tweets. People make use of indirect interpretations to express their views. Thus arises the need of detecting other figurative languages occurrence in similes. For proper understanding of text, occurrences of sarcasm, irony and humor in similes is necessary. Current approaches mainly focus on detection of one or two figurative languages at once. This paper proposes classification of different figurative languages at once using deep learning concept such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and machine learning concepts like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier.

The performance of the proposed solutions is evaluated with an advanced 5G NR compliant system-level simulator with high degree of realism. The results show that the centralized multi-cell scheduling achieves up to 60% latency improvement over the traditional distributed scheduling while fulfilling the challenging reliability of URLLC.

Distributing antennas is an appealing approach to provide fairly uniform coverage and enable macro-diversity. However, the careful design of the locations of the RRHs is crucial to achieve the potential gains of DM-MIMO systems. In this paper, we consider the optimal RRH placement problem to maximize the average rate in the downlink (DL) of a DM-MIMO system employing zero-forcing. To this end, we first develop a mathematically tractable, yet accurate expression for the DL rate. We then use this rate expression to formulate the optimal RRH placement problem. Due to the inherent complexity of this problem, we propose two sub-optimal, yet effective, RRH placement schemes. First, we consider a homogeneous propagation environment, ignoring the effects of any obstructions on the propagation characteristics of the wireless signal. Next, we consider RRH placement in a non-homogeneous propagation environment, specifically, in the presence of buildings in the coverage area. The proposed algorithms yield up to 21% improvement in the average rate and up to 72% improvement in the cell-edge rate compared to the state-of-the-art placement strategies.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08529184.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"70597","endPage":"70614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On RRH Placement for Multi-User Distributed Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On RRH Placement for Multi-User Distributed Massive MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529184/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18584947","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8529184/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On RRH Placement for Multi-User Distributed Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-minasian-2880149-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103656S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8529184","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529186,"authors":[{"name":"Guansheng Shu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8529186/shu-2880196-small.gif","p":["Guansheng Shu received the B.E. degree from Jilin University in 2011.

Generally, there are three stages in the workflow, including local inference on the mobile device, data transmission of the intermediate result, and remote inference in the cloud. However, the time cost of local inference and data transmission are still the bottleneck in reaching the desirable inference performance. In this paper, we propose an image-aware inference framework called IF-CNN to enable fast inference based on computation offloading. In the framework, we first build a model pool consisting of CNN models with different complexities. The most efficient one from such candidate models is selected to process the corresponding image. During the selection process, we have designed an effective model to predict the confidence based on multi-task learning. After model selection, half-floating optimization and feature compression are applied to accelerate the process of distributed inference between mobile devices and cloud. Experimental results show that IF-CNN is credible to identify the most effective model for different images and the total inference performance could be significantly improved. Meanwhile, IF-CNN is complementary to other inference acceleration methods of CNN models.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08529186.pdf","startPage":"68621","endPage":"68633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IF-CNN: Image-Aware Inference Framework for CNN With the Collaboration of Mobile Devices and Cloud","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529186/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"IF-CNN: Image-Aware Inference Framework for CNN With the Collaboration of Mobile Devices and Cloud","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495748","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8529186/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002855","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB0204005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"IF-CNN: Image-Aware Inference Framework for CNN With the Collaboration of Mobile Devices and Cloud","sourcePdf":"access-shu-2880196-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084041S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8529186","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529188,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Min","affiliation":["School of Science, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8529188/min-2880279-small.gif","p":["Chao Min (M\u201908) was born in Xindu, Chengdu, China, in 1982.

Wavelet transform is an effective denoising method related to regularized inversion. In this paper, wavelet transform is utilized to decompose and extract the low- and high-frequency information of the blurred image, which is taken as the first step of the presented deblurring methods in this paper. However, when the process highlights the approximate portion of the image feature, the blurry image will be smoothed so that the image is distorted. Simultaneously, the overall wavelet transform will result in excessive data redundancy for the image. Thus, in the second step, based upon the recursive convolution neural network, a deep recursive convolutional neural network (R-DbCNN) is designed, which can eliminate or weaken the characteristics of high data redundancy and image smoothness caused by wavelet transform to remove the blur of corrupted image. Comparing with the traditional convolution neural network in image restoration, R-DbCNN has better performance in deblurring with fast training speed. Thereafter, a novel loss function is built to attain the best deblurring effect of the proposed method based on the L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n regularization term. The experiment results demonstrate that our method has practical applicability for image restoration with different blurs, such as the motion blur, Gaussian blur, and out-of-focus by camera.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08529188.pdf","startPage":"69242","endPage":"69252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880279","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Deblurring via a Novel Recursive Deep CNN Improved by Wavelet Transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Blind Deblurring via a Novel Recursive Deep CNN Improved by Wavelet Transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529188/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529188/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495750","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11526173 and 11601451"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004753","fundingName":"Southwest Petroleum University","grantNumber":"2015QHZ028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Blind Deblurring via a Novel Recursive Deep CNN Improved by Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"access-min-2880279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103311S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8529188","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529190,"authors":[{"name":"Deyu Kong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8529190/kong-2880033-small.gif","p":["Deyu Kong received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics.

It is highly desirable to design a transmitter that can emit signals smartly, i.e., the power emission is exactly based on the emitting distance required and the target. Such a design can save huge amount of power as there are almost countless wireless devices in use currently. In this paper, an intelligent radio-frequency transmitter integrated with artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented. The intelligent transmitter consists of an ANN module, a frequency generation module, and a switch-mode PA. The integrated three-layered fully connected ANN can be offline trained to smartly classify input data according to the required power and assign the transmission channel. Furthermore, with the integrated ANN, the average power consumption of the PA is reduced to 34.3 mW, which is 46.5 % lower than PA without the ANN. With the intelligent transmitter, wireless devices can save a large amount of energy in their operations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18495751","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529190/","displayDocTitle":"Realization of a Power-Efficient Transmitter Based on Integrated Artificial Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61774028"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016Z007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Realization of a Power-Efficient Transmitter Based on Integrated Artificial Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-kong-2880033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111894S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8529190","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8529194,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhi Liao","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, IMEC\u2013Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8529194/liao-2880083-small.gif","p":["Wenzhi Liao (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Hainan Normal University, Haikou, China, in 2006, the Ph.D. degree in engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science engineering from Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, in 2012.","Since 2012, he has been holding a post-doctoral position at Ghent University and then a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen, Belgium).

In addition, the CNN was compared against a conventional multi-layered perceptron (MLP). The better mean absolute error, root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation (r), and Nash Suttcliff coefficient of efficiency values were obtained with the proposed CNN. A difference of 37.006 mm was obtained in terms of RMSE compared with ACCESS and 15.941 compared with conventional MLP. Further investigation revealed that the CNN was generally performing better in months with higher annual averages, while ACCESS was performing better in months with low annual averages.

First, the SBL framework is developed for a single measurement vector setting with an underlying sparse target reflectivity parameter vector. This is subsequently extended to scenarios with multiple observation snapshots considering uncorrelated as well as correlated target reflectivity parameters. Variants are also proposed for challenging scenarios considering the presence of ground clutter.

Due to relatively easy implementation, most studies have tried to recover the transmitted scene from multiple images rather than single image. However, the use of multiple images is not practical for common users in real situations due to the critical shooting conditions. In this paper, we propose single-image reflection removal using convolutional neural networks. We provide a ghosting model that causes reflection effects in captured images. First, we synthesize multiple-reflection images from the input single one based on ghosting model and relative intensity. Then, we construct an end-to-end network that consists of encoder and decoder. To optimize the network parameters, we use a joint training strategy to learn the layer separation knowledge from the synthesized reflection images. For the loss function, we utilize both internal and external losses in optimization. Finally, we apply the proposed network to single-image reflection removal. Compared with the previous work, the proposed method does not need handcrafted features and specular filters for reflection removal. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully removes reflection from both synthetic and real images as well as achieves the highest scores in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and feature similarity.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2880088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8548629/08529204.pdf","startPage":"1954","endPage":"1966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8548629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2880088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Image Reflection Removal Using Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"Single Image Reflection Removal Using Convolutional Neural Networks","htmlLink":"/document/8529204/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18320551","pubMedId":"30418902","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872280"},{"fundingName":"International S&T Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFG12780"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Image Reflection Removal Using Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-jung-2880088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155838S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8548629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8548629","articleId":"8529204","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529206,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8636396/8529206/li-2880048-small.gif","p":["Min Li (S\u201914\u2013M\u201918) received the B.S. degree from UESTC, Chengdu, China, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2018.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong.

The decoupling mechanism is illustrated by investigating the electric-field (E-field) and magnetic-field (H-field) distributions. The E-field distributions indicate that the NFRs above the patches serve as coupling-mode transducers to produce an orthogonal coupling mode at the desired resonance, leading to high port isolation between the patches. The H-field distributions demonstrate that the H-fields in the substrate are confined within the excited element, leading to the effective suppression of antenna mutual coupling. The NFR can be easily applied to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas having multiple patch elements. Three practical decoupling examples are demonstrated and the simulation and measurement results show that impedance matching for each antenna port and isolation of better than 20 dB are achieved for all these examples using the NFRs. Moreover, for the H-plane and E-plane decoupling of wideband two-port MIMO antennas, wide decoupled impedance bandwidths of 6.1% and 5.8% are obtained, respectively. More results of radiation patterns reveal that good radiation performance is reserved with no reduction in realized gain or front-to-back ratio.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2880048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8636396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2880048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8636396/08529206.pdf","startPage":"755","endPage":"764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Isolation Enhancement for MIMO Patch Antennas Using Near-Field Resonators as Coupling-Mode Transducers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Isolation Enhancement for MIMO Patch Antennas Using Near-Field Resonators as Coupling-Mode Transducers","volume":"67","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529206/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18452502","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529206/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isolation Enhancement for MIMO Patch Antennas Using Near-Field Resonators as Coupling-Mode Transducers","sourcePdf":"tap-li-2880048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.207681S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8636396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8636396","articleId":"8529206","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8529212,"authors":[{"name":"Yanwei Pang","affiliation":["Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8886618/8529212/pang-2880223-small.gif","p":["Yanwei Pang (M\u201907\u2013SM\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2004.

To remove haze from a visual signal, in this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network for visual haze removal called HRGAN. HRGAN consists of a generator network and a discriminator network. A unified network jointly estimating transmission maps, atmospheric light, and haze-free images (called UNTA) is proposed as the generator network of HRGAN. Instead of being optimized by minimizing the pixel-wise loss, HRGAN is optimized by minimizing a novel loss function consisting of pixel-wise loss, perceptual loss, and adversarial loss produced by a discriminator network. Classical model-based image dehazing algorithms consist of three separate stages: 1) estimating transmission map; 2) estimating atmospheric light; and 3) restoring haze-free image by using an atmospheric scattering model to process the transmission map and atmospheric light. Such a separate scheme is not guaranteed to achieve optimal results. On the contrary, UNTA performs transmission map estimation and atmospheric light estimation simultaneously to obtain joint optimal solutions. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world image databases demonstrate that HRGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","accessionNumber":"19100186","htmlLink":"/document/8529212/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2019","volume":"29","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Visual Haze Removal by a Unified Generative Adversarial Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61632081, 61871470 and 61503274"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004356","fundingName":"Nokia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Visual Haze Removal by a Unified Generative Adversarial Network","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-li-2880223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114271S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8886618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8886618","articleId":"8529212","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529214,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Wei","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8529214/wei-2879930-small.gif","p":["Zhiqiang Wei (S\u201916) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012.

A beam splitting technique is designed to generate multiple analog beams to serve multiple NOMA users on each radio frequency chain. In contrast to the recently proposed single-beam mmWave-NOMA scheme which can only serve multiple NOMA users within the same analog beam, the proposed scheme can perform NOMA transmission for the users with an arbitrary angle-of-departure distribution. This provides a higher flexibility for applying NOMA in mmWave communications and thus can efficiently exploit the potential multi-user diversity. Then, we design a suboptimal two-stage resource allocation for maximizing the system sum-rate. In the first stage, assuming that only analog beamforming is available, a user grouping and antenna allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the conditional system sum-rate based on the coalition formation game theory. In the second stage, with the zero-forcing digital precoder, a suboptimal solution is devised to solve a non-convex power allocation optimization problem for the maximization of the system sum-rate which takes into account the quality of service constraints. Simulation results show that our designed resource allocation can achieve a close-to-optimal performance in each stage. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed multi-beam mmWave-NOMA scheme offers a substantial spectral efficiency improvement compared to that of the single-beam mmWave-NOMA and the mmWave orthogonal multiple access schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2879930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08529214.pdf","startPage":"1705","endPage":"1719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2879930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Beam NOMA for Hybrid mmWave Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Beam NOMA for Hybrid mmWave Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529214/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18467812","htmlLink":"/document/8529214/","volume":"67","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP160104566"},{"fundingName":"Linkage Project","grantNumber":"LP 160100708"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Early Career Researcher Award funding scheme","grantNumber":"DE170100137"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Beam NOMA for Hybrid mmWave Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wei-2879930-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139415S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8529214","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8529223,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Sun","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8635013/8529223/sun-2878245-small.gif","p":["Yiming Sun received the B.S. degree in automation from the Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China, in 2015, and the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems.","His research interests include robust control and filters, network control systems, and event-triggered control."]},"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0002-0272-5609","id":"37086617525"},{"name":"Jinyong Yu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8635013/8529223/yu-2878245-small.gif","p":["Jinyong Yu was born in Harbin, Heilongjiang, China, in 1977.

Furthermore, the capacitor voltage is self-balanced without utilizing the complicated control strategy and additional control circuits. The phase disposition pulsewidth modulation is adopted to reduce the total harmonic distortion. The topology can generate different levels with a wide range of modulation index. In addition, the topology can also work in overmodulation. Compared with the traditional SC multilevel inverter, the absence of H-bridge makes low-voltage stress in proposed topology. The voltage stress of all switches is not more than the input voltage. Operational principles, modulation strategy, and voltage stress analysis are discussed.

The theory of characteristic modes is applied to analyze the eigenmodes of the design in the frequency range of 600-3000 MHz. All the resonant modes are clearly tracked and identified. Each mode of the bezel has the even and odd states and can be illustrated by a two-slot model. The multiple modes of the bezel can be effectively excited by a simple probe. By changing the locations of the connecting strips and feeder and introducing an inductor, two fundamental modes and four higher order modes of the bezel are merged, providing sufficient bandwidth for mobile communication. The measured -6 dB bandwidths are 805-995 and 1340-2870 MHz, and the measured radiation efficiency is above 65% in both bands.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2880045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8636396/08529226.pdf","startPage":"745","endPage":"754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2880045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8636396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TCM-Based Bezel Antenna Design With Small Ground Clearance for Mobile Terminals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529226/","displayDocTitle":"TCM-Based Bezel Antenna Design With Small Ground Clearance for Mobile Terminals","volume":"67","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18467306","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529226/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701024 and 61771057"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TCM-Based Bezel Antenna Design With Small Ground Clearance for Mobile Terminals","sourcePdf":"tap-deng-2880045-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070381S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8636396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8636396","articleId":"8529226","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529227,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Huang","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0002-5922-9075","id":"37086431376"},{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0003-3575-5086","id":"37292384500"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37290858000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8529227","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Optical transmitters","Light emitting diodes","OFDM","Optical receivers","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","free-space optical communication","interference suppression","light emitting diodes","OFDM modulation","optical modulation","optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced ADO-OFDM","asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM","local network","global network","novel visible light communication attocell","optical access point","conventional ADO-OFDM","novel heterogeneous attocell network","VLC","enhanced asymmetrically clipped dc-biased optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing scheme","cochannel interference avoidance","light-emitting diode sources","transmitter semiangles","signal-to-noise ratio","average capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VLC","optical attocell network","heterogeneous networks","enhanced ADO-OFDM","average achievable capacity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529227","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8605392/08529227.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2880200","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2880200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Heterogeneous Attocell Network Based on the Enhanced ADO-OFDM for VLC","abstract":"In this letter, an enhanced asymmetrically clipped dc-biased optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ADO-OFDM) scheme is proposed with asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM for the local network and dc-biased optical OFDM for the global network to avoid co-channel interference.

Although contribution and involvement of people is a key factor in both crowdsensing and crowdsourcing systems which provides reliability and data quality, level of human contribution is what makes crowd-powered systems different. To scrutinize this difference it is considered that user intervention in crowd-based schemes can be either implicit or explicit. Since one of the most important applications of crowdsourcing and crowdsensing systems is providing location services in indoor environments, in this paper, we study the level of user contribution in available crowd-powered techniques and propose a classification for crowd-powered indoor localization solutions to clarify which crowds-based approach is utilized in each indoor localization solution because in many cases the distinction is not clear and often leads to misconception. Dependency on site survey process is considered as another distinction point in our proposed classification. Hence, we consider indoor localization solutions with implicit user participation and latent mobile utilization as crowdsensing indoor localization systems. Respectively, indoor localization solutions with explicit user participation and manifest mobile utilization are classified as crowdsourcing indoor localization systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2018.2880180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8662729/08529230.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2018.2880180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8662729","startPage":"2408","endPage":"2434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowdsourcing and Sensing for Indoor Localization in IoT: A Review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Crowdsourcing and Sensing for Indoor Localization in IoT: A Review","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1, 1 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 April1, 2019","accessionNumber":"18505842","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8529230/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowdsourcing and Sensing for Indoor Localization in IoT: A Review","sourcePdf":"jsen-rezazadeh-2880180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.244181S","chronDate":"April1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8662729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8662729","articleId":"8529230","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529233,"authors":[{"name":"Debdeep Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8636396/8529233/sarka-2880047-small.gif","p":["Debdeep Sarkar (S\u201913) was born in Burdwan, India, in 1989.

The proposed technique first utilizes finite-difference time-domain method to compute the time-domain radiating antenna currents from near-zone electric/magnetic fields. Further, the far-zone time-domain radiated power is analytically estimated using a suitable IDM of the antenna spacetime current distributions. The time-domain reactive energy is calculated by adopting a rigorous energy subtraction approach. The proposed time-domain IDM technique is first validated by reproducing the standard antenna-Q-factor results of half-wavelength thin-wire dipoles. Second, time-domain reactive energy signatures are obtained for pulse-excited single and multiband dipole antennas, both in isolated condition and two-element multi-in multi-out (MIMO) topology. Third, the effects of parasitic reflector and director elements on the spatio-temporal energy dynamics of thin-wire Yagi-Uda antennas are demonstrated. The proposed algorithm is very general, applicable to arbitrary antenna shape and spacetime excitations, and hence is expected to enable engineers to look beyond traditional single frequency Q-factors of electrically small antennas to probe into the more fundamental spatio-temporal energy dynamics of general radiating structures, especially future generation 5G MIMO antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8636396/08529233.pdf","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2880047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2880047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8636396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics of Antenna Reactive Energy Using Time-Domain IDM Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Dipole antennas","Finite difference methods","Antenna radiation patterns","Current distribution","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna radiation patterns","dipole antenna arrays","finite difference time-domain analysis","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","Q-factor","reflector antennas","time-domain analysis","Yagi antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna reactive energy","time-domain IDM method","time-domain infinitesimal dipole model method","arbitrary shaped antennas","finite-difference time-domain method","far-zone time-domain radiated power","antenna spacetime current distributions","rigorous energy subtraction approach","time-domain IDM technique","thin-wire dipoles","time-domain reactive energy signatures","two-element multiin multiout topology","thin-wire Yagi-Uda antennas","arbitrary antenna shape","spacetime excitations","electrically small antennas","general radiating structures","future generation 5G MIMO antennas","near-zone electric fields","near-zone magnetic fields","time-domain radiating antenna currents","antenna-Q-factor","pulse-excited single antennas","multiband dipole antennas","parasitic reflector","time-domain excitations","spatio-temporal energy dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","infinitesimal dipole model (IDM)","near field","reactive energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of Antenna Reactive Energy Using Time-Domain IDM Method","volume":"67","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8529233/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18452530","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of Antenna Reactive Energy Using Time-Domain IDM Method","sourcePdf":"tap-sarkar-2880047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114987S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8636396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8636396","articleId":"8529233","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529234,"authors":[{"name":"Rebal Jurdi","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8529234/jurdi-2879934-small.gif","p":["Rebal Jurdi received the Bachelor of Engineering degree (Hons.) in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Each period consists of two phases: an uplink training phase and a downlink data transmission phase. Each actuator must successfully receive its unique packet within a single transmission phase; else, an outage is declared. Such an outage can be caused by two events: a transmission error due to transmission at a rate that the channel cannot actually support or time overflow, where the downlink data phase is too short, given the channel conditions to successfully communicate all the packets. We determine the closed-form expressions for the time overflow probability when there are just two field devices, as well as the transmission error probability for an arbitrary number of devices. In addition, we provide upper and lower bounds on the time overflow probability for an arbitrary number of devices. We propose a novel variable-rate transmission method that eliminates time overflow. Detailed system-level simulations are used to identify system design guidelines, such as the optimal amount of training time, as well as for benchmarking the proposed system design versus non-cooperative cellular, cooperative fixed-rate, and cooperative relaying.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2879934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2879934","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08529234.pdf","startPage":"1238","endPage":"1253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage of Periodic Downlink Wireless Networks With Hard Deadlines","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8642462/8529234-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","displayDocTitle":"Outage of Periodic Downlink Wireless Networks With Hard Deadlines","volume":"67","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529234/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18467834","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529234/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSFCCF-1514275"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Outage of Periodic Downlink Wireless Networks With Hard Deadlines","sourcePdf":"tcomm-jurdi-2879934-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165115S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8529234","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8529236,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqiu Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8620574/8529236/jwang-2879814-small.gif","p":["Jianqiu Wang was born in Anqing, China, in 1994.

First, the imaging model is deduced and the echo characteristics are analyzed. Then, the imaging processing algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the target's profiles, where the 3D echoes are decomposed into two 2D echoes. The azimuthal profile can be obtained by performing fast Fourier transform in the orbital angular momentum domain, and the target information in the y dimension is calculated by the azimuthal distribution, which is as a function of the slow time. The range-Doppler algorithms used in the fast time and slow time domains to achieve the range profile and cross-range profile. Finally, the target's 3D image in the Cartesian coordinate is obtained according to the spatial geometric relationship. This paper can benefit the applications of OAM-carrying waves in radar realms as well as the development of the 3D imaging technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18410331","htmlLink":"/document/8529236/","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Target Imaging Based on Vortex Stripmap SAR","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571011 and 61801486"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Target Imaging Based on Vortex Stripmap SAR","sourcePdf":"jsen-liu-2879814-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069149S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8620574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8620574","articleId":"8529236","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8529246,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8636396/8529246/chen-2880043-small.gif","p":["Qiang Chen was born in Xinyang, China, in 1991.

The FSR is composed of a resistive sheet and a bandpass frequency-selective surface (FSS). The unit cell of the resistive sheet is a resistor-loaded hexagonal metallic loop, each side of which is inserted with a circular spiral resonator (CSR) in the center. The CSR is equivalent to a parallel LC circuit that has a high inductance and low parasitic capacitance. At a high frequency of 10 GHz, the CSR resonates to be infinite impedance, around which a 0.5 dB transmission band of 8.68-11.34 GHz is produced. The bandpass FSS is a triple-layer FSS in which two layers of identical hexagonal patches are coupled through a layer of hexagonal aperture; it has a fast rolloff 0.5 dB transmission band of 8.2-11.33 GHz, which almost coincides with that of the resistive sheet. The 1 dB transmission band of the FSR by placing the resistive sheet on the bandpass FSS is 8.3-11.07 GHz. At low frequency, the FSR performs as an absorber, and the 10 dB absorption band is 2.4-7.1 GHz. In addition, due to its tiny physical sizes of only 1.2 mm \u00d7 1.6 mm, the CSR can be viewed as a lumped element circuit with a high inductance, in which the parallel resonance is almost independent to the incident angle.

From the streamlines that terminate on the array element loads, a geometrical shape can be assigned to the effective area of the array. These concepts provide an intuitive tool for understanding mutual coupling effects in antenna arrays. The decrease in directivity associated with mutual coupling effects, the so-called element-gain paradox, can be explained by the overlap of the element effective area shapes. The critical element spacing for the element-gain paradox effect can be predicted from the effective area shape for a single isolated array element. Antenna design for minimizing mutual coupling, which is of interest in multiple input multiple output communications systems, magnetic resonance imaging arrays, astronomical arrays, and other applications, can be guided by analysing the effective area shape for a single isolated array element.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8636396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2880049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8636396/08529254.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"891","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2880049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intuitive Way to Understand Mutual Coupling Effects in Antenna Arrays Using the Poynting Streamline Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"An Intuitive Way to Understand Mutual Coupling Effects in Antenna Arrays Using the Poynting Streamline Method","volume":"67","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8529254/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18433735","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intuitive Way to Understand Mutual Coupling Effects in Antenna Arrays Using the Poynting Streamline Method","sourcePdf":"tap-diao-2880049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07998S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8636396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8636396","articleId":"8529254","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8529256,"authors":[{"name":"Fuhong Lin","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8529256/lin-2879988-small.gif","p":["Fuhong Lin received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.

However, the limited capacity of components makes such a situation more complicated. This paper aims to reduce serving time by allocating the available bandwidth to four kinds of services. A utility model is built according to the abovementioned serving methods and is solved through a two-step approach. For the first step, all the sub-optimal solutions are provided based on a Lagrangian algorithm. For the second step, an optimal solution selection process is presented and analyzed. A numerical simulation is executed to illustrate the allocation results and the optimal utility model while optimizing the survivability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization-Oriented Resource Allocation Management for Vehicular Fog Computing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879988","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08529256.pdf","startPage":"69294","endPage":"69303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529256","topic":"Advanced Big Data Analysis for Vehicular Social Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529256/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimization-Oriented Resource Allocation Management for Vehicular Fog Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8529256/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495760","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Key Projects","grantNumber":"61602034"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimization-Oriented Resource Allocation Management for Vehicular Fog Computing","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2879988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102887S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Advanced Big Data Analysis for Vehicular Social Networks"],"articleId":"8529256","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529257,"authors":[{"name":"Chaozhu Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8529257/zhang-2880237-small.gif","p":["Chaozhu Zhang was born in 1970.

To predict the open-circuit magnetic field, an analytical model named Schwarz-Christoffel subdomain (SCSD) is proposed by applying the virtual rotor magnets and combining two elegant models, i.e., subdomain model and complex permeance model derived from Schwarz-Christoffel conformal mapping. Based on the developed SCSD model, electromagnetic (EM) performances such as cogging torque, back-electromotive force, EM torque, unbalanced magnetic force, and machine losses can be quickly obtained by reducing the computational complexity. Subsequently, the heuristic optimization is applied for selecting the best compromise between the conflicting objectives. Since the systematic optimization methodology is proposed by isolating the optimal shape and coil design procedures, the proposed optimization model combined with SCSD is significantly fast, robust, and efficient compared with existing models. The finite-element analysis is carried out to verify analytical results, and several Pareto fronts are provided along with the comparison of the time required by each model.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2018.2877403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2018.2877403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/8581524/08529263.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8581524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Systematic Design Optimization of Surface-Mounted PM Machines Using Advanced Analytical Models and Subharmonic Elimination Methods","volume":"55","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18365017","htmlLink":"/document/8529263/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2018","externalId":"8100216","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Systematic Design Optimization of Surface-Mounted PM Machines Using Advanced Analytical Models and Subharmonic Elimination Methods","sourcePdf":"tmag-min-2877403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126783S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8581524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8581524","articleId":"8529263","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529271,"authors":[{"name":"Congqi Cao","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8886618/8529271/cao-2879913-small.gif","p":["Congqi Cao received the B.E. degree in information and communication from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2018.

Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is another attractive solution considering their advantages in parallelization, effectiveness in feature learning, and model base sufficiency. Besides these, skeleton data are low-dimensional features. It is natural to arrange a sequence of skeleton features chronologically into an image, which retains the original information. Therefore, we solve the sequence learning problem as an image classification task using CNNs. For better learning ability, we build a classification network with stacked residual blocks and having a special design called linear skip gated connection which can benefit information propagation across multiple residual blocks. When arranging the coordinates of body joints in one frame into a skeleton feature, we systematically investigate the performance of part-based, chain-based, and traversal-based orders. Furthermore, a fully convolutional permutation network is designed to learn an optimized order for data rearrangement. Without any bells and whistles, our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2879913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8886618/08529271.pdf","startPage":"3247","endPage":"3257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2879913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8886618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skeleton-Based Action Recognition With Gated Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529271/","displayDocTitle":"Skeleton-Based Action Recognition With Gated Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"29","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8529271/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19100187","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002663","fundingName":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","grantNumber":"31020180QD138"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skeleton-Based Action Recognition With Gated Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-cao-2879913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131474S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8886618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8886618","articleId":"8529271","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8529272,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8886618/8529272/zhang-2880227-small.gif","p":["Bo Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in optical engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2013.

We employ an algorithm-hardware co-design methodology, yielding a hardware-friendly compression approach with low power consumption. In our method, the image is first micro-shifted, and then the sub-quantized values are further compressed. Two methods, FAST and MRF models, are proposed to recover the bitdepth by exploiting the spatial correlation of natural images. Both methods can decompress images progressively. On an average, our compression algorithm can compress images to 1.25-bits per pixel with a resulting quality that outperforms the state-of-the-art on-chip compression algorithms in both peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity. Then, we propose a hardware architecture and implement the algorithm on an FPGA.

However, the MPC has several technical challenges and issues including the need of accurate system models, computational complexity, and variable switching frequency operation and weighting factor selection, when it comes to the control of an MMC. In the past few years, several research studies are conducted to address some of the challenges and issues in an MPC and developed several model predictive algorithms for an MMC. In this paper, the importance of each challenge and its impact on the system performance is discussed. Also, the MMC mathematical models used in the implementation of MPC are presented. Furthermore, some of the popular MPC algorithms are discussed briefly, and their features and performance are highlighted through case studies.

This is because oil has optical properties that are different from water to modulate oil-water spatial and spectral contrasts. However, understanding these contrasts is challenging because of variable results from laboratory and field experiments as well as from different observing conditions and spatial/spectral resolutions of remote sensing imagery. Here, through reviewing published oil-water spectral contrasts and analyzing remotely sensed spectra collected by several satellite and airborne sensors (MERIS, MODIS, MISR, Landsat, and AVIRIS) from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we provide the interpretation of the spatial/spectral contrasts of various oil slicks and discuss the challenges in such interpretations. In addition to oil thickness, several other factors also affect oil-water spatial/spectral contrasts, including sun glint strength, oil emulsification state, optical properties of oil covered water, and spatial/spectral resolutions of remote sensing imagery. In the absence of high spatial- and spectral-resolution imagery, a multistep scheme may be used to classify oil type (emulsion and non-emulsion) and to estimate relative oil thickness for each type based on the known optical properties of oil, yet such a scheme requires further research to improve and validate.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2876091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2876091","startPage":"2643","endPage":"2658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8697166/08529276.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8697166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Challenges of Interpreting Oil\u2013Water Spatial and Spectral Contrasts for the Estimation of Oil Thickness: Examples From Satellite and Airborne Measurements of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","displayDocTitle":"The Challenges of Interpreting Oil\u2013Water Spatial and Spectral Contrasts for the Estimation of Oil Thickness: Examples From Satellite and Airborne Measurements of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2019","volume":"57","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529276/","accessionNumber":"18617339","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529276/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship","grantNumber":"NNX16AN95H"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007240","fundingName":"Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative","grantNumber":"SA 12-10"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Challenges of Interpreting Oil\u2013Water Spatial and Spectral Contrasts for the Estimation of Oil Thickness: Examples From Satellite and Airborne Measurements of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill","sourcePdf":"tgrs-sun-2876091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088947S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8697166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8697166","articleId":"8529276","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8529277,"authors":[{"name":"Guanglou Zheng","affiliation":["Security Research Institute, Edith Cowan University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8610268/8529277/zheng-2879929-small.gif","p":["Guanglou Zheng (M\u201913) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, in 2016.

However, current WIMD products lack security safeguards to protect patients from fatal cyber attacks. In the recent past, electrocardiogram (ECG) signals-based security techniques have been widely explored to secure such devices by using two cryptographic primitives, the fuzzy commitment and the fuzzy vault, respectively. Nonetheless, differences, as well as similarities between these two primitives, have not been well investigated, making it difficult to decide which one would be appropriate for a particular setting. In this paper, we perform a critical analysis on both primitives and discuss their merits and drawbacks in the context of the ECG-based key distribution. We analyze the critical challenges within each primitive-based key distribution technique, such as binary sequence generation and polynomial computations. Experimental results show that the technique based on the fuzzy commitment has a better false acceptance rate due to the randomness of ECG binary sequences. On the other hand, the fuzzy vault based scheme can achieve an acceptable false reject rate (5%) with less cost to the WIMDs. Future research is suggested to enhance the precision of ECG signal processing, to improve the efficacy of binary sequence generation process as well as to suggest ways to reduce polynomial computations.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8610268/08529277.pdf","startPage":"1186","endPage":"1198","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2018.2879929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2018.2879929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8610268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Critical Analysis of ECG-Based Key Distribution for Securing Wearable and Implantable Medical Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Critical Analysis of ECG-Based Key Distribution for Securing Wearable and Implantable Medical Devices","htmlLink":"/document/8529277/","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2019","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18376108","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Critical Analysis of ECG-Based Key Distribution for Securing Wearable and Implantable Medical Devices","sourcePdf":"jsen-yang-2879929-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103921S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8610268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8610268","articleId":"8529277","onlineDate":"09 November 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8529279,"authors":[{"name":"Hariprasad Chandrakumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8580626/8529279/chand-2876468-small.gif","p":["Hariprasad Chandrakumar (M\u201918) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, India, in 2010, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles, (UCLA) Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2012 and 2018, respectively.","He has held internship positions with Texas Instruments and Broadcom, where he has worked on analog filters and amplifiers for wireless applications.

In this work, generalized spatial modulation (GSM) based transmission is used in Rayleigh fading channel with known channel correlations and fading loss. The transmission mode selection based on energy efficiency is proposed based on BER requirement which reduces the complexity. The signal detection approach, Maximum likelihood QR decomposition algorithm (MLQR) is proposed with low computational complexity. The proposed approach decomposes the channel coefficients into two matrices and the likelihood detection is used for simplifying the process. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated with the Bit error rate (BER), and Energy efficiency. The performance measure of the proposed approach is compared with the conventional approaches for showing the efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509796/8529154/08529326.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","doi":"10.1109/I2CT.2018.8529326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CT.2018.8529326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient and Low Complexity Signal Detection with Generalized Spatial Modulation for Massive MIMO System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Signal detection","Transmitting antennas","Complexity theory","Modulation","GSM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","energy conservation","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","modulation","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication power management","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized spatial modulation based transmission","Rayleigh fading channel","fading loss","transmission mode selection","energy efficiency","BER requirement","low computational complexity","likelihood detection","low complexity signal detection","massive MIMO system","communication field","high speed data transmission","transmitting antenna","system configurations","channel correlations","large scale multiple input multiple output","energy efficient signal detection","maximum likelihood QR decomposition algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial modulation","signal detection","large scale MIMO system","energy efficiency","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient and Low Complexity Signal Detection with Generalized Spatial Modulation for Massive MIMO System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529326/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18249290","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient and Low Complexity Signal Detection with Generalized Spatial Modulation for Massive MIMO System","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2018_Paper788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093602S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509796","isNumber":"8529154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509796","xplore-issue":"8529154","articleId":"8529326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8529335,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Firstly, background from captured frames is removed using Gaussian mixture based background/foreground segmentation algorithm in order to capture moving areas in the frame and thereafter median filtering has applied to remove random noise from the frame. Then binary thresholding with Otsu's binarization has applied and it will identify optimal threshold value and these processed frames are merged and cumulative motion history image is generated using a developed algorithm based on the structural similarity measure.

Pretrained convolutional neural network i.e. AlexNet is trained by using the features such as textures, colors and shape. The model is trained on more than 1600 images and can classify images into four object categories like one, two, five and ten rupees coins. The trained model is tested on various standard and own recorded datasets consist of rotational, translated and shifted images.

But due to several facts like unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, smoking habits, etc. health diseases are increasing day by day. Among them heart diseases are the major causes of death. Risk factors like high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, irregular pulse rate, diabetes, eating habits, age being a major support for occurring heart diseases. Due to the lack of accurate medical support systems which are capable enough to find hidden patterns of medical data and predict diseases, people unable to know the occurrence of diseases in advance. This paper presents a survey about different data mining and neural network classification technologies used in predicting the risk of occurring heart diseases based on risk factors. The risk level of a person is classifying using techniques like K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, Decision Trees, Genetic algorithm, Na\u00efve Bayes etc. and the accuracy is high when using more attributes and combinations of above techniques.","doi":"10.1109/I2CT.2018.8529532","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CT.2018.8529532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529154","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509796/8529154/08529532.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heart Diseases Prediction with Data Mining and Neural Network Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529532/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Heart Diseases Prediction with Data Mining and Neural Network Techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529532/","accessionNumber":"18233101","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heart Diseases Prediction with Data Mining and Neural Network Techniques","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2018_Paper614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048565S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509796","isNumber":"8529154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509796","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8529154","articleId":"8529532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8529535,"authors":[{"name":"Reshma R.

High data transmission rates are necessary for the wireless communication. In this paper, by calculating Bit Error Rate various wireless communication systems such as SISO, MIMO are compared. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems are integral part of current wireless network. These MIMO systems uses more than one antenna at Tx side and at Rx side, so systems transmission reliability is improved. These system increases channel capacity and provides diversity gain without additional transmit power. MIMO system enhances capacity and reliability of system. In this proposed system for signal transmission we used CPM modulation. Constant envelope and phase continuity can be obtained by using CPM modulation technique. The study of Bit Error Rate (BER) is done for both SISO system and MIMO system theoretically and empirically. For SISO system we obtained the BER for different modulation order by using PAM modulation technique. As the modulation order increases the BER performance also increases. For MIMO system we used CPM modulation technique. As we increases the number of Tx and Rx antennas BER performance increases.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCT.2018.8529535","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference On Advances in Communication and Computing Technology (ICACCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference On Advances in Communication and Computing Technology (ICACCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510744/8529319/08529535.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCT.2018.8529535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529319","startPage":"269","endPage":"272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Bit Error Rate Evaluation for SISO and MIMO System by CPM Modulation Technique Using Matlab","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Bit Error Rate Evaluation for SISO and MIMO System by CPM Modulation Technique Using Matlab","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529535/","conferenceDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"February 2018","accessionNumber":"18249515","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8529535/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Bit Error Rate Evaluation for SISO and MIMO System by CPM Modulation Technique Using Matlab","confLoc":"Sangamner, India","sourcePdf":"ICACCT2018_Paper143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104269S","chronDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510744","isNumber":"8529319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510744","xplore-issue":"8529319","articleId":"8529535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8529561,"authors":[{"name":"Narayan Sharma","affiliation":["Department of ECE NIT, Kurukshetra"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086512974"},{"name":"Rajoo Pandey","affiliation":["Department of ECE NIT, Kurukshetra"],"firstName":"Rajoo","lastName":"Pandey","id":"37086509292"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4273-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-4272-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4274-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8529561","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Size measurement","Compressed sensing","Discrete cosine transforms","Computational complexity","Sparse matrices","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","image processing","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block processing","uniform block sparsity","image recovery","parallel processing","gray image","computational complexity","compressive sensing","image partitioning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block image","Compressive sensing","DCT matrix","Sparsity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a method for compressive sensing and recovery of gray image from the samples has been proposed.

Presently, one method to compete such policies is to use an authorized cloud server to maintain the user data and have access control over it. At times, when one of the servers keeping data is compromised, the security of the user data is compromised. For getting access control, maintaining data security and obtaining precise computing results, the data owners have to keep attribute-based security to encrypt the stored data. During the delegation of data on cloud, the cloud servers may be tampered by the counterfeit cipher-text. Furthermore, the authorized users may be cheated by retorting them that they are unauthorized. Largely the encryption control access attribute policies are complex. In this paper, we present Cipher-text Policy Attribute-Based Encryption for maintaining complex access control over encrypted data with verifiable customizable authorization. The proposed technique provides data confidentiality to the encrypted data even if the storage server is comprised. Moreover, our method is highly secured against collusion attacks. In advance, performance evaluation of the proposed system is elaborated with implementation of the same.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCT.2018.8529627","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference On Advances in Communication and Computing Technology (ICACCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference On Advances in Communication and Computing Technology (ICACCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510744/8529319/08529627.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCT.2018.8529627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Attribute Based Encryption and Customizable Authorization in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529627/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Attribute Based Encryption and Customizable Authorization in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"February 2018","accessionNumber":"18233420","htmlLink":"/document/8529627/","conferenceDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Attribute Based Encryption and Customizable Authorization in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sangamner, India","sourcePdf":"ICACCT2018_Paper112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04865S","chronDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510744","isNumber":"8529319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510744","xplore-issue":"8529319","articleId":"8529627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8529630,"authors":[{"name":"Pooja R.

By including sparsely-initiating regularization term to portrayal coefficient I can better describe every pixel's nearby portrayal.

Since the cloud is not trusted, it is necessary to guarantee the correctness of shared data in the cloud. Further, whenever the user is revoked from group, the blocks need to be resigned while maintaining integrity. However, user revocation process increases computation and communication overhead for users. Recently, several mechanisms have been devised to address revocation problem in the cloud, but, they did not address this issue efficiently and securely. In this paper, we propose a public integrity auditing scheme for shared data with efficient and secure user revocation, using identity-based signatures. Whenever the user is revoked, our scheme enables the proxy server to resign the blocks to save existing group user's computation and communication costs. Meanwhile, a third party verifier always audits the integrity of shared data in the cloud through the challenge-response protocol. The security analysis shows that proposed scheme is provably secure and performance analysis demonstrates that our scheme is efficient when compared with existing schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference On Advances in Communication and Computing Technology (ICACCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510744/8529319/08529650.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference On Advances in Communication and Computing Technology (ICACCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCT.2018.8529650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCT.2018.8529650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529319","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Public Integrity Auditing for Shared Data with Efficient and Secure User Revocation in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Protocols","Performance analysis","Data integrity","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data integrity","digital signatures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared data","secure user revocation","cloud computing","cloud storage","shared group","user revocation process","revocation problem","public integrity auditing scheme","identity-based signatures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Public integrity auditing","user revocation","shared data","identity-based signatures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Public Integrity Auditing for Shared Data with Efficient and Secure User Revocation in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529650/","publicationDate":"February 2018","accessionNumber":"18233415","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","conferenceDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Public Integrity Auditing for Shared Data with Efficient and Secure User Revocation in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sangamner, India","sourcePdf":"ICACCT2018_Paper273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085677S","chronDate":"8-9 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510744","isNumber":"8529319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510744","xplore-issue":"8529319","articleId":"8529650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8529687,"authors":[{"name":"Keyur V.

The early detection of bearing condition prevents the possible loss in terms of revenue as well as the downtimes of the industrial process.

Diagnosing the skin lesion is the first step towards its treatment. In this work we have assimilated two approaches on the pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks on the ImageNet dataset. Firstly, we use the transfer learning approach without any fine tuning and obtained features are fed for linear classification task. Secondly, we use the transfer learning approach with fine tuning.

In this paper the impact of adjacent and co-channel interference is studied and BER has been investigated and compared for three different channels i.e. Rayleigh fading channel., Rician fading channel and AWGN channel using a QAM modulated technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Channels of Mimo System with Respect to Adjacent & Co-Channel Interference Using QAM Modulation Technique","publicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","doi":"10.1109/I2CT.2018.8529800","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 3rd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8509796/8529154/08529800.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CT.2018.8529800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Channels of Mimo System with Respect to Adjacent & Co-Channel Interference Using QAM Modulation Technique","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529800/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18249162","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Channels of Mimo System with Respect to Adjacent & Co-Channel Interference Using QAM Modulation Technique","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2018_Paper073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04079S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8509796","isNumber":"8529154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8509796","xplore-issue":"8529154","articleId":"8529800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8529808,"authors":[{"name":"H.

[14] As of the this papers writing, detecting Alzheimer's is a difficult and time consuming task, but requires brain imaging report and human expertise. Needless to say, this conventional approach to detect Alzheimer's is costly and often error prone. In this paper an alternative approach has been discussed, that is fast, costs less and more reliable. Deep Learning represents the true bleeding edge of Machine Intelligence. Convolutional Neural Networks are biologically inspired Multilayer perceptron specially capable of image processing.

However, the transmission rate of the VLC remains low due to the low bandwidth performance of LEDs and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Therefore, a hybrid approach using pulse amplitude modulation and pulse width modulation in conjunction with an artificial neural network (ANN) equalizer is proposed, which can theoretically increase the transmission rate by 4 times compared with the traditional way, and provide variable brightness to realize the integration of data transmission and illumination control. In addition, an artificial neural network equalizer is proposed to undo the effects of ISI, considering that the bandwidth of the LED is only 3MHz. Without the ANN equalizer, the maximum transmission rate of the proposed hybrid modulation link only reaches 36 Mbps under the condition of no signal processing; however, with the ANN equalizer, the transmission speed can up to 2.6 Gbps. The proposed system not only achieves a genuine combination of data transmission and control illumination levels, but also realizes a high data rate with less complexity.","doi":"10.1109/OGC.2018.8529913","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 3rd Optoelectronics Global Conference (OGC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8501331/8529844/08529913.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 3rd Optoelectronics Global Conference (OGC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OGC.2018.8529913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Speed Novel Hybrid Modulation Technique of Visible Light Communication Based on Artificial Neural Network Equalizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Equalizers","Modulation","Artificial neural networks","Bandwidth","Receivers","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","free-space optical communication","intersymbol interference","light emitting diodes","neural nets","optical modulation","pulse amplitude modulation","pulse width modulation","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED","illumination levels control","pulse width modulation","pulse amplitude modulation","inter-symbol interference","low bandwidth performance","universal illumination","VLC","visible light communication","high speed novel hybrid modulation technique","transmission speed","hybrid modulation link","maximum transmission rate","ANN equalizer","ISI","data transmission","artificial neural network equalizer","bandwidth 3.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visible light communication","code division multiple access","pulse amplitude modulation","artificial neural network equalizer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"High Speed Novel Hybrid Modulation Technique of Visible Light Communication Based on Artificial Neural Network Equalizer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529913/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18249110","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Speed Novel Hybrid Modulation Technique of Visible Light Communication Based on Artificial Neural Network Equalizer","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"OGC-09G0036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120154S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8501331","isNumber":"8529844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8501331","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8529844","articleId":"8529913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8529943,"authors":[{"name":"Naif Alsowaidi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering & Technology, Multimedia University, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Naif","lastName":"Alsowaidi","id":"37085479078"},{"name":"Tawfig Eltaif","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering & Technology, Multimedia University, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Tawfig","lastName":"Eltaif","id":"37697740200"},{"name":"Mohd Ridzuan Mokhtar","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering & Technology, Multimedia University, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Ridzuan","lastName":"Mokhtar","id":"37284102200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7399-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7398-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7400-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8529943","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"Optical pulse position modulation-code division multiple access (PPM-CDMA) system with an interference rejection scheme is theoretically analyzed.

Thus, we present an algorithm of area coverage for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles based on the density function in limited time for gas distribution mapping in this paper. The algorithm divides the area into some unequal subareas and achieves the path planning of these areas. Finally the effectiveness of this algorithm is verified by comparing with the equal area coverage algorithm by simulation and analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICMIC.2018.8529963","publicationTitle":"2018 10th International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control (ICMIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 10th International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control (ICMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510752/8529838/08529963.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMIC.2018.8529963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Area Coverage for Gas Distribution Mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529963/","displayDocTitle":"Research on Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Area Coverage for Gas Distribution Mapping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18233503","htmlLink":"/document/8529963/","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Area Coverage for Gas Distribution Mapping","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"ICMIC2018_paper_071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068967S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510752","isNumber":"8529838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510752","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8529838","articleId":"8529963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8529984,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Sun","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering and Automation, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085519632"},{"name":"Chengrui Bai","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering and Automation, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Chengrui","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086509051"},{"name":"Lei Gao","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering and Automation, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086512979"},{"name":"Xianyu Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering and Automation, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xianyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086353024"},{"name":"Sabir Ghauri","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Design and Mathematics, University of the West of England"],"firstName":"Sabir","lastName":"Ghauri","id":"37377721700"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering and Automation, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wang","id":"38258923800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5416-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-5415-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5417-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8529984","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Network topology","Topology","Throughput","Sensors","Jamming","Dynamic spectrum access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","radio spectrum management","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel selection methods","Random channel selection","Receiver-directed channel selection","dynamic spectrum access environment","regular control channel standards","wireless network","dynamic spectrum access technology","spectrum channel handoff","DSA","secondary users","network attack probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic spectrum access","random channel selection","receiver-directed channel selection","throughput"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic spectrum Access (DSA) is used to make use of the spectrum in wireless network. In most situations, control channel is used as a common approach to negotiate between secondary users. However, based on this feature, the whole network can be destroyed by influencing the control channel only. This paper analyzed and simulated two channel selection methods (Random channel selection and Receiver-directed channel selection) without control channel. And we design a dynamic spectrum access environment and use different topologies to simulate and analysis the algorithms. The results prove that those methods are available. The Receiver-directed channel selection is more match to the regular control channel standards in throughput by comparisons, and the attack probability of network is decreased by the successful spectrum channel handoff.","doi":"10.1109/ICMIC.2018.8529984","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 10th International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control (ICMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8510752/8529838/08529984.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8529838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMIC.2018.8529984","publicationTitle":"2018 10th International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control (ICMIC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Channel Selection Methods with Dynamic Spectrum Access Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8529984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2018","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Channel Selection Methods with Dynamic Spectrum Access Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8529984/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8529984/","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"18249573","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2018","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Channel Selection Methods with Dynamic Spectrum Access Technology","confLoc":"Guiyang, China","sourcePdf":"ICMIC2018_paper_064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075109S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8510752","isNumber":"8529838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8510752","xplore-issue":"8529838","articleId":"8529984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8529992,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyun Liu","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Opto Electronics Engineering, University of Beijing Information & Science Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingyun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086512708"},{"name":"Qiao Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanics and Acoustics, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086508810"},{"name":"Zhe Fan","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanics and Acoustics, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086510436"},{"name":"Yudong Jia","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Opto Electronics Engineering, University of Beijing Information & Science Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yudong","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086511769"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7399-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7398-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7400-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8529992","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Companies","Autonomous vehicles","Distance measurement","Three-dimensional displays","Measurement by laser beam"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","optical radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEMS technology","ZOL technology","3D-flash lidar","multiline scanning lidar","single-line scanning lidar","autonomous vehicle","TOF lidar development","lidar development direction","nonscanning lidar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["autonomous vehicle","TOF lidar","scanning lidar","non-scanning lidar","single-line scanning lidar","multi-line scaninng lidar","3D flash lidar","MEMS technology","ZOL technology"]}],"abstract":"Lidar has been widely used in military and civilian applications.
