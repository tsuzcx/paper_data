ErasureBench automatically instantiates and scales a cluster of storage nodes, and can seamlessly leverage existing failure traces. As a first example, we use ErasureBench to compare three coding implementations: a (10,4) Reed-Solomon (RS) code, a (10,6,5) locally repairable code (LRC), and a partition of the data source in ten pieces without error-correction. Our experiments show that LRC and RS codes require the same repair throughput when used with small storage nodes, since cluster and network management traffic dominate at this regime. With large storage nodes, read and write traffic increases and our experiments confirm the theoretical and practical tradeoffs between the storage overhead and repair bandwidth of RS and LRC codes.","doi":"10.1109/SRDSW.2016.20","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems Workshops (SRDSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593913/7600133/07600154.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDSW.2016.20","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems Workshops (SRDSW)","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Have a Seat on the ErasureBench: Easy Evaluation of Erasure Coding Libraries for Distributed Storage Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-26 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Have a Seat on the ErasureBench: Easy Evaluation of Erasure Coding Libraries for Distributed Storage Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600154/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600154/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397886","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"26-26 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Have a Seat on the ErasureBench: Easy Evaluation of Erasure Coding Libraries for Distributed Storage Systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"5259a055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050896S","chronDate":"26-26 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593913","isNumber":"7600133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593913","xplore-issue":"7600133","articleId":"7600154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7600173,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhu","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085887324"},{"name":"Zhifeng Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405444600"},{"name":"Jun Wu","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wu","id":"38524132400"},{"name":"Dong Guo","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085896840"},{"name":"Shaoxian Tang","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shaoxian","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085890125"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3951-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3952-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600173","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling Algorithm Design for Virtualized Hardware Accelerator in C-RAN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600173","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Hardware","Servers","Scheduling algorithms","Virtualization","Long Term Evolution","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","radio access networks","scheduling","telecommunication computing","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling algorithm design","virtualized hardware accelerator","cloud radio access network","HA","C-RAN architecture","base stations","virtual machines","cloud platform","pipelined first-come-first-service","PL-FCFS","turbo decoding","LTE physical layer","LTE PHY","Xen paravirtualization environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PL-FCFS","C-RAN","hardware accelerator","paravirtualization","LTE"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve energy efficiency of computation-intensive workloads in Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), virtualized hardware accelerators (HA) are proposed in this paper. In C-RAN architecture, the base stations (BS) are running in the virtual machines. Virtualization mechanism of HA makes each BS feel like owning a HA exclusively, but actually BSs sharing the HAs. To tackle the problem of efficiently sharing HA by multiple BSs in the cloud platform, a scheduling algorithm with pipelined first-come-first-service (FCFS) was proposed in this paper, named PL-FCFS. PL-FCFS sets up two queues for tasks aiming to fully utilize HA with pipelining model. With this design, multiple virtual BSs can access the HA simultaneously and efficiently. To evaluate the performance of PL-FCFS, we use HA to accelerate turbo decoding of LTE physical layer(LTE PHY), and implement this scheduling algorithm for virtuaized HA in Xen paravirtualization environment. Experimental results indicate that four virtual BSs running LTE PHY with 5M bandwidth can be supported well by the PL-FCFS based evaluation system, and the performance is improved by 25% compared with FCFS scheduling algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCRI.2016.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCRI.2016.13","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Cloud Computing Research and Innovations (ICCCRI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Cloud Computing Research and Innovations (ICCCRI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593908/7600159/07600173.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling Algorithm Design for Virtualized Hardware Accelerator in C-RAN","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-5 May 2016","accessionNumber":"16397850","htmlLink":"/document/7600173/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling Algorithm Design for Virtualized Hardware Accelerator in C-RAN","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3951a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089737S","chronDate":"4-5 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593908","isNumber":"7600159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593908","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7600159","articleId":"7600173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600176,"authors":[{"name":"Jiming Yao","affiliation":["Global Energy Interconnection Research institute, Nanjing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiming","lastName":"Yao","id":"37085892316"},{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Broadband Wireless Commun. & Sensor Network Technol., Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087237078"},{"name":"Mingkai Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Broadband Wireless Commun. & Sensor Network Technol., Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Mingkai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085724558"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Ministry of Education, (Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications), China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280762700"},{"name":"Gejuan Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Broadband Wireless Commun. & Sensor Network Technol., Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Gejuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37087755874"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3951-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3952-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600176","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600176","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Protocols","3GPP","Bandwidth","Machine-to-machine communications","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","cryptography","redundancy","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GBS-AKA scheme","group-based secure authentication and key agreement scheme","M2M device","4G network","wireless communication","cyber network","3GPP","massive machine to machine device","core network access","redundant signaling reduction","authentication delay","malware attack prevention","bandwidth consumption","signaling congestion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["M2M","GBS-AKA","Bandwidth consumption","Signaling Congestion"]}],"abstract":"With the rapidly development of wireless communication, security authentication has became more and more significant for avoiding the repeated establishment of authentication facilities for various applications.

The output of RBF neural network is the ultimate bearing capacity of bolt and the number of hidden layer nodes is determined by the subtraction clustering algorithm; Second, the initial center and width of the hidden layer is determined by K-means and PSO algorithm is introduced to optimize the the hidden layer centers and widths of RBF neural network. The weight between hidden layer and output layer is obtained by the least squares method; finally, a PSO-RBF neural network model is established to predict ultimate bearing capacity of bolts.

Experimental validation of these control algorithms is critical for their practical applications. This paper investigates a state-observer-based Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller (SOTSFC) design for a semi-active quarter-car suspension installed with a magnetorheological (MR) damper and provides proof of the effectiveness of the proposed controller. To conduct the test, a quarter-car test rig and control system hardware were used. Then, a new MR damper was designed and built to fit with the test rig. After that, the SOTSFC for the quarter-car test rig was developed. Finally, several tests were conducted on the quarter-car suspension in order to investigate the real effect of the SOTSFC. It was then compared with the use of a skyhook controller to demonstrate its benefits.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2016.2619361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2016.2619361","startPage":"291","endPage":"300","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7855861/07600353.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Control for Semi-Active Vehicle Suspension With a Magnetorheological Damper and Experimental Validation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Control for Semi-Active Vehicle Suspension With a Magnetorheological Damper and Experimental Validation","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600353/","accessionNumber":"16669166","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600353/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council's funding scheme","grantNumber":"DP140100303 and LP150100040"},{"fundingName":"University of Wollongong and China Scholarship Council joint scholarships"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Control for Semi-Active Vehicle Suspension With a Magnetorheological Damper and Experimental Validation","sourcePdf":"tmech-du-2619361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089905S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7855861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7855861","articleId":"7600353","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7600356,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Nuzzo","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, The University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7849237/7600356/nuzzo-2619321-small.gif","p":["Stefano Nuzzo received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical\n engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

It is also well known that such a winding incurs extra losses in the machine due to a number of reasons. In order to improve the overall efficiency and performance of classical salient-pole, wound field synchronous generators that employ the traditional damper cage, an improved amortisseur winding topology that reduces the inherent loss is proposed and investigated in this paper. This is essential in order to meet modern power quality requirements and to improve the overall performance of such \u201cclassical\u201d machines. The new topology addresses the requirements for lower loss components without compromising the acceptable values of the output voltage total harmonic distortion and achieves this by having a modulated damper bar pitch. As vessel for studying the proposed concept, a 4-MVA salient-pole synchronous generator is considered. A finite element model of this machine is first built and then validated against experimental results. The validated model is then used to investigate the proposed concept with an optimal solution being achieved via the implementation of a genetic algorithm optimization tool. Finally, the performance of the optimized machine is compared to the original design both at a steady state and transient operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2619321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2619321","startPage":"1958","endPage":"1970","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7849237/07600356.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Damper Cage Design for Salient-Pole Synchronous Generators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Improved Damper Cage Design for Salient-Pole Synchronous Generators","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600356/","accessionNumber":"16668301","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600356/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Damper Cage Design for Salient-Pole Synchronous Generators","sourcePdf":"tie-nuzzo-2619321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129529S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7600356","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7600359,"authors":[{"name":"Hongming Cai","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7847463/7600359/cai-2619369-small.gif","p":["Hongming Cai (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1996, 1999, and 2002, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Researchers have been exploring spintronics to achieve nonvolatility, low dynamic power, zero standby power, and high device density. Several novel materials and phenomena have recently been discovered in this field, including the monumental spin-transfer torque (STT) effect. Since then, aggressive research activities have been conducted in both academia and industry in the field of STT-based devices, circuits, and memories. The accomplishments in this field can be revamped to a nonvolatile computing architecture for the future. The purpose of this article is to review the status and prospects of STT-based devices and their circuit implications along with future challenges. Starting with the basic concepts and device physics, advanced applications of STT are discussed. The outlook for cutting-edge technology is provided in terms of novel magnetoresistive devices embodied in the form of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) controlled by the giant spin Hall effect (GSHE ) and an electric field. Moreover, the concepts of all-spin logic (ASL) and MTJ-based logic are discussed.

First, ANOMA introduces an artificial symbol-offset between packets destined for different user equipment (UE) in order to reduce their mutual interference. Second, ANOMA adopts a pre-coding at the base station and a whitening-and-decomposing (WD) detection scheme at the receiving UE to simplify signal detection. With these two novel techniques, ANOMA can significantly enlarge the achievable rate region of the traditional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Moreover, the impact of pulse shape and symbol offset on the performance of ANOMA scheme are investigated in both Gaussian and Rayleigh block-fading channels. The numerical results show that ANOMA with precoding and WD detection outperforms asynchronous NOMA with successive interference cancellation detection, both outperform synchronous NOMA.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619339","startPage":"402","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07600375.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous NOMA for Downlink Transmissions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous NOMA for Downlink Transmissions","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668416","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7600375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"No. 2014A030313549 and No. 61372078"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous NOMA for Downlink Transmissions","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-2619339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055681S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7600375","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7600377,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7777000/7600377/yang-2613850-small.gif","p":["Yang Yang (GS\u201912) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.","His current research interests include analog, RF, and millimeter-wave integrated circuits in silicon technologies for wireless communications and phased-array systems."]},"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-6829-3936","id":"37086199674"},{"name":"Ozan Dogan Gurbuz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7777000/7600377/gurbu-2613850-small.gif","p":["Ozan Dogan Gurbuz (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.","From 2008 to 2010, he was a Graduate Student Researcher with the METUMEMS Center, Middle East Technical University, where he was involved in RF microelectromechanical systems device fabrication and reliability measurements.

It is shown numerically and analytically that the data-assisted scheme can reduce channel estimation errors and improve the signal-to-interference performance of uplink massive MIMO systems significantly with the appropriate channel temporal correlation.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619341","startPage":"430","endPage":"433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07600379.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Temporal Channel Correlation in Data-Assisted Massive MIMO Uplink Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Temporal Channel Correlation in Data-Assisted Massive MIMO Uplink Detection","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668429","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7600379/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401192 and 61461136001"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Innovation Project","grantNumber":"KQCX2014052215132295"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Temporal Channel Correlation in Data-Assisted Massive MIMO Uplink Detection","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wang-2619341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048299S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7600379","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7600382,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Basit Shahab","affiliation":["Department of IT Convergence Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Muhammad Basit","lastName":"Shahab","id":"38467459900"},{"name":"Md Fazlul Kader","affiliation":["Department of IT Convergence Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Md Fazlul","lastName":"Kader","id":"38666979700"},{"name":"Soo Young Shin","affiliation":["Department of IT Convergence Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soo Young","lastName":"Shin","id":"38541296600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7600382","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1369},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Interference","Fading channels","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual user pairing scheme","unpaired user spectrum utilizatiom","nonorthogonal multiple access","NOMA system","nonoverlapping frequency band pairing fashion","conventional multiple access","ergodic sum capacity","independent Rayleigh flat fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conventional multiple access","ergodic sum capacity","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","user pairing"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a strategy to efficiently utilize the spectrum of unpaired users in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. This is done by pairing multiple similar gain users to a single distant user in a nonoverlapping frequency band pairing fashion. We consider a case where the number of far users in a cell is larger than the number of near users. Thus, some far users cannot be paired and should get data using conventional multiple access (OMA). In such case, we propose a strategy where a near user can be paired with multiple (two) far users to optimally utilize the spectrum of unpaired users in the NOMA system. Performance of the proposed pairing scheme is evaluated in terms of ergodic sum capacity over independent Rayleigh flat fading channel. Analytical and simulation results show that significant increase in the capacity gain of the system is achieved by using the proposed strategy compared to OMA and conventional NOMA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Virtual User Pairing Scheme to Optimally Utilize the Spectrum of Unpaired Users in Non-orthogonal Multiple Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2619371","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7604153/07600382.pdf","startPage":"1766","endPage":"1770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2016.2619371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Virtual User Pairing Scheme to Optimally Utilize the Spectrum of Unpaired Users in Non-orthogonal Multiple Access","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7600382/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16423752","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2015R1D1A1A01061075"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Virtual User Pairing Scheme to Optimally Utilize the Spectrum of Unpaired Users in Non-orthogonal Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"lsp-shin-2619371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043299S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7604153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7604153","articleId":"7600382","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7600387,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Xue","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Network, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7600387/xue-2619418-small.gif","p":["Xuan Xue received the B.S. degree in communication engineering in\n 2010 from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in\n communication and information systems.","From 2013 to 2015, she was a visiting Ph.D. student at Western University, London, ON, Canada.

We focus on the rate maximization problem with the per antenna power constraints at the source and relay while taking into account the computational complexity and sparse characteristics of mm-wave channels. We solve this problem as follows. First, the precoding problem is formulated by exploiting the sparse and low-rank structures of mm-wave channels which is nonconvex. Second, we reformulate this nonconvex problem into two semidefinite programming (SDP) subproblems, each having a rank one constraint. Third, we propose two algorithms to solve these two SDP subproblems: interior-point-based and low complexity algorithms. Finally, the original rate maximization problem is examined by iteratively utilizing the solutions of these SDP problems. The proposed interior-point-based method to solve the SDP problem uses the standard convex optimization tools followed by the random vector generation scheme to get the rank one solution. However, the proposed low complexity algorithm examines the SDP problem in one-dimensional spatial signal space (i.e., without rank relaxation) via a new augmented Lagrangian function method. Simulation results show that both algorithms achieve good performances, and the latter one is much faster than the former one with a slight decrease in performance. In addition, both algorithms achieve superior performances compared to the existing precoding design algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source and Relay Precoding in Multiantenna Millimeter-Wave Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2619418","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07600387.pdf","startPage":"4924","endPage":"4937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2619418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source and Relay Precoding in Multiantenna Millimeter-Wave Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7600387/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965013","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372135 and 61601347"},{"fundingName":"111 project of China","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source and Relay Precoding in Multiantenna Millimeter-Wave Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-xue-2619418-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123699S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7600387","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7600391,"authors":[{"name":"Boyu Hu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Boyu","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0003-1132-7677","id":"37085830946"},{"name":"Yuan Du","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Du","id":"37072435200"},{"name":"Rulin Huang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rulin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085549114"},{"name":"Jeffrey Lee","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085435704"},{"name":"Young-Kai Chen","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Young-Kai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086000293"},{"name":"Mau-Chung Frank Chang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mau-Chung Frank","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085382552"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7600391","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1018},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Capacitors","Loading","Inverters","Resistors","Optical buffering","Circuits and systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","equalisers","feedforward","integrated circuit design","pulse amplitude modulation","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor digital-to-analog converter based technique","capacitor-DAC-based technique","preemphasis-enabled multilevel transmitters","multilevel wireline transmitter design","resistor-DAC-based multilevel transmitter design techniques","PAM-4 transmitter","2-tap feedforward equalization","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitor digital-to-analog converter (DAC)","PAM-4","pre-emphasis","transmitter","wireline"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a capacitor digital-to-analog converter (DAC) based technique that is suitable for pre-emphasis-enabled multilevel wireline transmitter design in voltage mode.

The appropriate switch combinations of each phase are determined by the control requirements of floating-capacitor voltages respectively and the hardware mapping method of the switching states is presented. Furthermore, the neutral-point voltage balance control strategy is presented. In order to balance the dc-link capacitor voltages, the seven-segment switching sequence is selected according to the control requirements of dc-link capacitor voltages and the neutral-point voltage regulatory factor is introduced to regulate the durations of the redundant switching states in a switching cycle.

Approximate message passing (AMP) methods, based on Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation, have recently attracted considerable attention for such problems. For large random transforms, these methods exhibit fast convergence and admit precise analytic characterizations with testable conditions for optimality, even for certain non-convex problem instances. However, the behavior of AMP under general transforms is not fully understood. In this paper, we consider the generalized AMP (GAMP) algorithm and relate the method to more common optimization techniques. This analysis enables a precise characterization of the GAMP algorithm fixed points that applies to arbitrary transforms. In particular, we show that the fixed points of the so-called max-sum GAMP algorithm for MAP estimation are critical points of a constrained maximization of the posterior density. The fixed points of the sum-product GAMP algorithm for estimation of the posterior marginals can be interpreted as critical points of a certain free energy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7748579/07600404.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2619365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2619365","startPage":"7464","endPage":"7474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed Points of Generalized Approximate Message Passing With Arbitrary Matrices","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7748579/7600404-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600404/","displayDocTitle":"Fixed Points of Generalized Approximate Message Passing With Arbitrary Matrices","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600404/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"16465916","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1116589, 1237821, 1302336, 1564142 and 1547332"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1018368, CCF-1218754 and CCF-1527162"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1254204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-677"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Fixed Points of Generalized Approximate Message Passing With Arbitrary Matrices","sourcePdf":"tit-schniter-2619365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120639S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7748579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7748579","articleId":"7600404","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600406,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond Catlett","affiliation":["ABB Inc., Collinsville, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7880726/7600406/catle-2619331-small.gif","p":["Raymond Catlett (SM'99) received the B.S.E.E. degree from the\n University of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, MO, USA, in 1977, and the Masters Engineering Management degree from Washington\n University, St. Louis, MO, in 2009, where he focuses on technology assessment and innovation.","Since 2000, he has been with ABB in many roles, currently as a Senior Technical Consultant.

Experimental data and TCAD simulations showed an improved SET response for the pnp comparator circuit. 2-D raster scans revealed that the devices in the pnp circuit exhibit a reduction in sensitive area of up to 80% compared to their npn counterparts. In addition, by sweeping the input voltage, the sensitive operating region with respect to SETs was determined. By establishing a figure-of-merit, relating the transient peaks and input voltage polarities, the pnp device was determined to have a 21.4% improved response with respect to input voltage. This study has shown that using pnp devices is an effective way to mitigate SETs, and could enable further radiation-hardening-by-design techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2619582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7869239/07600407.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"96","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2619582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Event Transient Response of Comparator Pre-Amplifiers in a Complementary SiGe Technology","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/23/7869239/7600407-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Single-Event Transient Response of Comparator Pre-Amplifiers in a Complementary SiGe Technology","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7600407/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16721584","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000774","fundingName":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency","grantNumber":"HDTRA-1-13-C-0058"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"DGE-1148903"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Single-Event Transient Response of Comparator Pre-Amplifiers in a Complementary SiGe Technology","sourcePdf":"tns-ildefonso-2619582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102791S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7869239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7869239","articleId":"7600407","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7600410,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Cheng Dong","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Tibet University, Lhasa, China","Key Laboratory of Info Coding & Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7600410/dong-2616383-small.gif","p":["Zhi-Cheng Dong (SM\u201912\u2013M\u201916) was born in Langzhong, China, in 1982.

This paper proposes candidate models for the digital predistortion of static I/Q imbalanced sources exciting a dynamic MIMO Volterra system. The proposed models are enhanced using a novel technique based on subsample resolution to account for dynamic I/Q imbalance distortions. Finally, the computational complexity of the proposed models is analyzed for implementation suitability in digital platforms. It is shown that the error spectrum for the proposed models in subsample resolution reaches the noise floor of the measurements. The proposed models achieve a normalized mean squared error of -50 dB and an adjacent channel power ratio of -57 dB for signal bandwidths upto 65 MHz and crosstalk levels ranging to -10 dB.

The first experiment leverages predistorted KR4 51.5625 Gb/s electrical PAM4 signaling generated by an arbitrary waveform generator to drive SWDM TOSAs at 850, 880, 910, and 940 nm. The received optical PAM4 signals are then post processed offline with linear equalizers to improve the eye quality. Detailed analysis of the height and width of the received optical eyes indicates an aggregated 206.25 Gb/s speed is achievable on a single NGWBMMF beyond 150 m.

Channel estimation in vehicular environments for such signals is a challenging issue, as evidenced by related studies for the IEEE 802.11p standard. Existing channel estimation methods often yield deficient performance or require relatively high latency to achieve better performance, unless additional pilots are introduced. We propose a technique that addresses this problem. The primary aspect of the design is to exploit the temporal correlation in channel responses over close-by OFDM symbols in a decision-oriented manner. A secondary aspect is to take advantage of any available pilots in the data symbols in a frequency-domain filtering built on the temporal processing results. Regarding the performance of the proposed method, we first analyze the proposed temporal processing technique under some simplistic channel conditions both for insight and for verification. Further simulation results based on the IEEE 802.11p specifications under a measurement-based fading multipath vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channel model show the superiority of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2619490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07600417.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2619490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","startPage":"4938","endPage":"4953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decision-Directed Channel Estimator for OFDM-Based Bursty Vehicular Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Decision-Directed Channel Estimator for OFDM-Based Bursty Vehicular Communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600417/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965053","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7600417/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002855","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of the R.O.C.","grantNumber":"MOST 104-3115-E-009-008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decision-Directed Channel Estimator for OFDM-Based Bursty Vehicular Communication","sourcePdf":"tvt-wei-2619490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124049S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7600417","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7600421,"authors":[{"name":"Yaojun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7951135/7600421/zhang-2619484-small.gif","p":["Yaojun Zhang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.","His current research interests include emerging nonvolatile memory design for high performance, low power and scalable computer architectures, statistical reliability analysis of memory technology, and customized array and cell level circuit design for STT-RAM technology."]},"firstName":"Yaojun","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-0125-2221","id":"38240486600"},{"name":"Bonan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7951135/7600421/yan-2619484-small.gif","p":["Bonan Yan received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2010.

As a promising candidate, spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) has demonstrated many attractive properties, such as nanosecond access time, high integration density, nonvolatility, and excellent CMOS integration compatibility. However, similar to all other nano-devices, the performance and reliability of STT-RAM cells are greatly affected by process variations, device operating uncertainties, and environmental fluctuations. As a result, the read and write operations of STT-RAM demonstrate some variabilities and errors. In this paper, we systematically analyze the impacts of CMOS and magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) process variations, MTJ resistance switching randomness that are induced by intrinsic thermal fluctuations, and working temperature changes on STT-RAM cell designs. The STT-RAM cell reliability issues in both read and write operations are first investigated. A combined circuit and magnetic simulation platform is then established to quantitatively study the persistent and nonpersistent errors in STT-RAM cell operations. Our analysis proved the importance of a full statistical design method in STT-RAM designs for design pessimism minimization.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7951135/07600421.pdf","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2016.2619484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2619484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Persistent and Nonpersistent Error Optimization for STT-RAM Cell Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Resistance","Random access memory","MOSFET","Switches","Thermal stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","random-access storage","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design pessimism minimization","full statistical design method","combined circuit-magnetic simulation platform","intrinsic thermal fluctuation","MTJ resistance switching randomness","MTJ process variation","magnetic tunneling junction process variation","CMOS process variation","write operation","read operation","environmental fluctuation","device operating uncertainty","process variation","STT-RAM cell reliability","CMOS integration compatibility","high-integration density","nanosecond access time","spin-transfer torque random access memory","next-generation nonvolatile memory technology","memory technology","technical scaling","memory capacity","STT-RAM cell design","persistent error optimization","nonpersistent error optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Process variation","reliability","spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM)","thermal fluctuation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Persistent and Nonpersistent Error Optimization for STT-RAM Cell Design","volume":"36","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7600421/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16970058","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000148","fundingName":"Division of Electrical Communications and Cyber Systems","grantNumber":"1202225"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"Division of Computer and Network Systems","grantNumber":"1253424"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Persistent and Nonpersistent Error Optimization for STT-RAM Cell Design","sourcePdf":"tcad-zhang-2619484-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106576S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7951135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7951135","articleId":"7600421","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7600426,"authors":[{"name":"Quoc-Viet Pham","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication System, Inje University, Gyeongnam, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7936707/7600426/pham-2619485-small.gif","p":["Quoc-Viet Pham received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in computer science from the Department of Information and Communication System, Inje University, South Korea, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Congestion control, used to adapt the traffic rates injected into a network, can be controlled separately at the transport layer or mutually with other layers, using a cross-layer design. The focus of this paper is a review of the research following the NUM framework and addressing the problem of congestion control from several dimensions, specifically, elastic traffic or inelastic traffic, same-timescale or multi-timescale, and single-path or multipath transmissions. First, cross-layer designs for wireless networks, basics of optimization theory, and an example of cross-layer congestion control are summarized. Then, studies on NUM-based congestion control are sequentially presented from several points of view. In addition, we survey the recent literature on cross-layer resource allocation in next generation networks, software-defined networking, and cloud radio access networks, which can enhance the performances and address issues found in current networks. Finally, we outline what we consider to be the current challenges and open issues in the area of NUM-based congestion control for wireless networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Utility Maximization-Based Congestion Control Over Wireless Networks: A Survey and Potential Directives","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2016.2619485","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7936707/07600426.pdf","startPage":"1173","endPage":"1200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2016.2619485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7936707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2017","displayDocTitle":"Network Utility Maximization-Based Congestion Control Over Wireless Networks: A Survey and Potential Directives","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7600426/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2017","accessionNumber":"16917916","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) by the Korea Government","grantNumber":"NRF-2016R1A2B1013733"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Utility Maximization-Based Congestion Control Over Wireless Networks: A Survey and Potential Directives","sourcePdf":"comst-hwang-2619485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217002S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7936707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7936707","articleId":"7600426","onlineDate":"19 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7600427,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Mohjazi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K."],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Mohjazi","orcid":"0000-0002-4866-1997","id":"38322320800"},{"name":"Imtiaz Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Imtiaz","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37291472300"},{"name":"Sami Muhaidat","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K.","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Muhaidat","id":"37393377900"},{"name":"Mehrdad Dianati","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K."],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Dianati","id":"37398308500"},{"name":"Mahmoud Al-Qutayri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Al-Qutayri","id":"37266039000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7600427","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1052},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Downlink","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","mathematical programming","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink beamforming","SWIPT multiuser MISO","underlay cognitive radio network","multiinput single-output","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","integrated power splitting","transmission power","secondary base station","beamforming vectors","closed form expression","semidefinite programming relaxation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink beamforming","wireless power transfer","cognitive radio","semi-definite programming"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates downlink beamforming for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multi-user multi-input single-output underlay cognitive radio networks.

Since the underlying optimization problem is non-convex, we resort to semidefinite programming relaxation and we analytically prove that the relaxation is in fact tight and yields optimal beamforming solution.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619340","startPage":"434","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07600427.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Beamforming for SWIPT Multi-User MISO Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Beamforming for SWIPT Multi-User MISO Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668403","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7600427/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Beamforming for SWIPT Multi-User MISO Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-mohjazi-2619340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052631S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7600427","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7600430,"authors":[{"name":"Chitradeep Majumdar","affiliation":["IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7600430/majum-2619358-small.gif","p":["Chitradeep Majumdar received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication from the West Bengal University of Technology in 2007 and the M.Sc. degree in radio frequency communication systems from the University of Southampton, U.K., in 2009.

It is one of the potential technologies adopted for Internet of Things (IoT) and other futuristic machine-to-machine-based applications. Many of these applications are power constrained and delay sensitive. Therefore, CRSN architecture must be coupled with different adaptive and robust communication schemes to take care of the delay and energy efficiency at the same time. Considering the tradeoff that exists in terms of energy efficiency and overhead delay for a given data packet length, it is proposed to transmit the physical layer payload with an optimal packet size (OPS) depending on the network condition. Furthermore, due to the cognitive feature of CRSN architecture overhead energy consumption due to channel sensing and channel handoff plays a critical role. Based on the above premises, in this paper, we propose a heuristic exhaustive search-based Algorithm-1 and a computationally efficient suboptimal low complexity Karuh-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition-based Algorithm-2 to determine the OPS in CRSN architecture using variable rate m-QAM modulation. The proposed algorithms are implemented along with two main cognitive radio assisted channel access strategies based on distributed time slotted-cognitive medium access control (DTS-CMAC) and centralized common control channel-based cognitive medium access control (CC-CMAC) and their performances are compared. The simulation results reveal that proposed Algorithm-2 outperforms Algorithm-1 by a significant margin in terms of its implementation time. For the exhaustive search-based Algorithm-1 the average time consumed to determine OPS for a given number of cognitive users is 1.2 s, while for KKT-based Algorithm-2, it is of the order of 5-10 ms. CC-CMAC with OPS is most efficient in terms of overall energy consumption but incurs more delay as compared to DTS-CMAC with OPS scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2619358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"6325","endPage":"6344","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07600430.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet Size Optimization for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks Aided Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7600430/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Packet Size Optimization for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks Aided Internet of Things","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16870762","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Packet Size Optimization for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks Aided Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"access-majumdar-2619358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.206926S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7600430","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7600433,"authors":[{"name":"Fara\u00f3n Llorens-Largo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Fara\u00f3n Llorens-Largo received the bachelor\u2019s degree in primary school education, the degree in computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering.

These schemes render a sparse user's position vector, and in parallel, minimize the distance between the online measurement and radio map. The overall localization scheme for both methods consists of three steps: 1) coarse localization, obtained from comparing the online measurements with clustered radio map. A novel graph-based method is proposed to cluster the offline fingerprints. In the online phase, a Region Of Interest (ROI) is selected within which we search for the user's location. 2) Access Point (AP) selection and 3) fine localization through the novel sparse recovery algorithms. Since the online measurements are subject to inordinate measurement readings, called outliers, the sparse recovery methods are modified in order to jointly estimate the outliers and user's position vector. The outlier detection procedure identifies the APs whose readings are either not available or erroneous. The proposed localization methods have been tested with Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements in a typical office environment and the results show that they can localize the user with significantly high accuracy and resolution which is superior to the results from competing WLAN fingerprinting localization methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2016.2616465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7963940/07600441.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2016.2616465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963940","startPage":"2079","endPage":"2092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Indoor WLAN Localization and Outlier Detection Scheme Using LASSO and Elastic-Net Optimization Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Indoor WLAN Localization and Outlier Detection Scheme Using LASSO and Elastic-Net Optimization Techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"8","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17131862","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7600441/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Indoor WLAN Localization and Outlier Detection Scheme Using LASSO and Elastic-Net Optimization Techniques","sourcePdf":"tmc-khalajmehrabadi-2616465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116393S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7963940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7963940","articleId":"7600441","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7600443,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Moll\u00e9n","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7600443/molle-2619343-small.gif","p":["Christopher Moll\u00e9n received the M.Sc. degree in 2013 and the Licentiate of Engineering degree in 2016 from Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Division for Communication Systems.

One-bit ADCs are one way to reduce power consumption. This paper presents an analysis of the spectral efficiency of single-carrier and orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) transmission in massive MIMO systems that use one-bit ADCs. A closed-form achievable rate, i.e., a lower bound on capacity, is derived for a wideband system with a large number of channel taps that employ low-complexity linear channel estimation and symbol detection. Quantization results in two types of error in the symbol detection. The circularly symmetric error becomes Gaussian in massive MIMO and vanishes as the number of antennas grows. The amplitude distortion, which severely degrades the performance of OFDM, is caused by variations between symbol durations in received interference energy. As the number of channel taps grows, the amplitude distortion vanishes and OFDM has the same performance as single-carrier transmission. A main conclusion of this paper is that wideband massive MIMO systems work well with one-bit ADCs.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7809190/7600443-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600443/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16618448","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7600443/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Performance of Wideband Massive MIMO With One-Bit ADCs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme through MAMMOET","grantNumber":"ICT-619086"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsr\u00e5det)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSF-CCF-1527079"},{"fundingName":"ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP [2016 (B0717-16-0002)]"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Uplink Performance of Wideband Massive MIMO With One-Bit ADCs","sourcePdf":"twc-mollen-2619343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152659S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7600443","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7600447,"authors":[{"name":"Lucas P.

Approximate message passing (AMP) methods, based on loopy belief propagation, are a promising class of approaches for approximate inference in these models. AMP methods are computationally simple, general, and admit precise analyses with testable conditions for optimality for large i.i.d. transforms A. However, the algorithms can diverge for general A. This paper presents a convergent approach to the generalized AMP (GAMP) algorithm based on direct minimization of a large-system limit approximation of the Bethe free energy (LSL-BFE). The proposed method uses a double-loop procedure, where the outer loop successively linearizes the LSL-BFE and the inner loop minimizes the linearized LSL-BFE using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The proposed method, called ADMM-GAMP, is similar in structure to the original GAMP method, but with an additional least-squares minimization. It is shown that for strictly convex, smooth penalties, ADMM-GAMP is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the LSL-BFE, thus providing a convergent alternative to GAMP that is stable under arbitrary transforms. Simulations are also presented that demonstrate the robustness of the method for non-convex penalties as well.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7792231/7600459-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7600459/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16636503","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Inference for Generalized Linear Models via Alternating Directions and Bethe Free Energy Minimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1116589, 1302336, 1564142 and 1547332"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1254204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2677"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1218754, CCF-1018368 and CCF-1527162"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council under the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC","grantNumber":"267439"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Inference for Generalized Linear Models via Alternating Directions and Bethe Free Energy Minimization","sourcePdf":"tit-schniter-2619373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145814S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7792231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7792231","articleId":"7600459","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7600460,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Foruhandeh","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), University of Quebec, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Foruhandeh","orcid":"0000-0001-8667-2665","id":"37085458158"},{"name":"Navid Tadayon","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), University of Quebec, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Navid","lastName":"Tadayon","id":"38237557500"},{"name":"Sonia A\u00efssa","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), University of Quebec, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"A\u00efssa","id":"37087068964"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7600460","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":787},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Queueing analysis","Interference","Uplink","Mathematical model","Probability","Stochastic processes","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","MIMO communication","queueing theory","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["k-tier heterogeneous networks","queuing theory approach","HetNets","user equipment","M/G/1 queue","stochastic geometry","transmit power","spatial distribution","service rate","traffic flow intensity","base station coverage threshold","probability generating function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous networks","queuing theory","outage probability","M/G/1 queue"]}],"abstract":"Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are expected to release enormous capacity beyond what is achievable now. This comes at the price of higher interference that may jeopardize proper network operation if not managed cautiously. In handling this problem, mathematical modeling of HetNets to understand their underlying facts is necessary. As the mathematical theory of waiting lines, queuing theory is exploited in this paper as a powerful tool to model the uplink transmission of a user equipment (UE) in a K-tier HetNet, as an M/G/1 queue with interruption operating at the packet level. By integrating key findings on HetNets (using stochastic geometry) into the queue, a realistic model is obtained. This model enables us to understand what a UE experiences in terms of throughput, an angle that has barely been looked through by others. The modeling framework considers all the essential HetNet parameters, including the transmit power, spatial distribution, service rate, traffic flow intensity, and base station coverage threshold, to obtain the probability generating function and related statistics of the UE queue length.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7809126/07600460.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Modeling of $K$ -Tier Heterogeneous Networks: A Queuing Theory Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Modeling of $K$ -Tier Heterogeneous Networks: A Queuing Theory Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600460/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16597831","htmlLink":"/document/7600460/","volume":"21","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Modeling of $K$ -Tier Heterogeneous Networks: A Queuing Theory Approach","sourcePdf":"lcomm-foruhandeh-2619338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045609S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7809126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7809126","articleId":"7600460","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7600469,"authors":[{"name":"Zan Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7600469/li-2618938-small.gif","p":["Zan Li (SM\u201914) received the B.S. degree in communications\n engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information systems, all from Xidian University,\n Xi'an, China, in 1998, 2001, and 2004, respectively.","She is currently a Professor with the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University.

Although the per-survivor processing algorithm (PSPA) based on joint data and channel estimation provides superior performance and robustness for MBCS, it is very difficult to implement it into practice due to the extremely high computational complexity. An adaptive state reduction scheme using a dimension-down PSPA (ADPSP) with few states in the trellis diagram is proposed based on the slow-fading characteristic of the meteor burst channel. It has the advantages of the dimension-down PSPA (D-PSPA) and the adaptive state reduction scheme based on PSPA proposed in our previous work. The scheme is proposed to reduce the computation complexity and memory size for exponentially decaying meteor burst channels and make the maximum likelihood sequence detection available for adaptive data transmission. Based on the estimation of parameters of the meteor burst channel, the adaptive threshold is obtained in order to decrease the computation compleixty of PSPA, where the states close to the correct one in the trellis is selected. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis. It is shown that the proposed adaptive state reduction scheme using a D-PSPA can obtain a good tradeoff between the achievable performance and its dynamically computation complexity, as well as provide reliable data transmission for MBCS using adaptive coding and modulation.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07600469.pdf","startPage":"4627","endPage":"4635","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2618938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2618938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive State Assignment Mechanism Based on Joint Data Detection and Channel Estimation on Fading Meteor Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive State Assignment Mechanism Based on Joint Data Detection and Channel Estimation on Fading Meteor Channel","htmlLink":"/document/7600469/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965070","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"7215433803, 7214433802 and 7214514902"},{"fundingName":"863 project","grantNumber":"2014AA8098080E"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301179, 61401323, 61401338 and 61471395"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive State Assignment Mechanism Based on Joint Data Detection and Channel Estimation on Fading Meteor Channel","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2618938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090029S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7600469","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7600845,"authors":[{"name":"Wassim Tabikh","affiliation":["EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France","Issy-les-Moulineaux, Orange Labs, France"],"firstName":"Wassim","lastName":"Tabikh","id":"37085737832"},{"name":"Dirk Slock","affiliation":["EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Slock","id":"37068992500"},{"name":"Yi Yuan-Wu","affiliation":["Issy-les-Moulineaux, Orange Labs, France"],"lastName":"Yi Yuan-Wu","id":"38338950600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600845","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"abstract":"The weighted sum rate (WSR) maximizing linear precoding algorithm is studied in large correlated single stream multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference broadcast channels (IBC).We consider an iterative WSR design which exploits the connection with Weighted sum Minimum Mean Squared Error (WMMSE) designs as in [1], [2], focusing on the version in [1].

The usage of an early Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) feedback based on a prediction of the decoder's outcome allows reducing the over-the-air latency, with particular advantages for mission critical applications. However, predicting the ACK/NACK feedback before detection occurs is unfortunately error prone. In this paper, we discuss the potential of using an early HARQ feedback in 5G networks considering the occurrence of wrong predictions. Two options are studied: only the early feedback is transmitted, and both early and regular feedback are transmitted, with the possibility of the latter one of correcting wrong early predictions. Numerical analysis shows the potential of the early feedback of reducing the over-the-air latency up to 50%. Wrong estimates can, however, significantly affect outage rate and latency for the case of only early feedback, while their impact is very minor in case the regular feedback is empowered to correct them.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600846","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600846.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the benefits of early HARQ feedback with non-ideal prediction in 5G networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the benefits of early HARQ feedback with non-ideal prediction in 5G networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600846/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408782","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the benefits of early HARQ feedback with non-ideal prediction in 5G networks","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570279334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048179S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7600847,"authors":[{"name":"Rami Othman","affiliation":["Zodiac Data Systems, Bretteville-1'Orgueilleuse, France","CentraleSupelec/IETR, Cesson-Sevigne Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Othman","id":"37085905279"},{"name":"Alexandre Skrzypczak","affiliation":["Zodiac Data Systems, Bretteville-1'Orgueilleuse, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Skrzypczak","id":"37293778700"},{"name":"Yves Lou\u00ebt","affiliation":["CentraleSupelec/IETR, Cesson-Sevigne Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Lou\u00ebt","id":"37571400800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600847","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Estimation","Partial transmit sequences","Modulation","Shape","Algorithm design and analysis","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase shift keying","radiocommunication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOQPSK waveform","shaped offset quadrature phase shift keying waveform","signal angle distribution analysis","phase synchronization problem","phase offset estimation algorithm","short pilot sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["shaped offset quadrature phase shift keying (SOQPSK)","Phase offset","synchronization","pilot sequence"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the problem of phase synchronization is investigated for the shaped offset quadrature phase shift keying (SOQPSK) waveform, a highly bandwidth-efficient modulation.

The limited beamwidth makes the CE incapable of resolving multiple channel paths from the same cluster when the angular spread is less than or equal to the beamwidth. Therefore, how to efficiently obtain reliable links which provide maximum spatial degree-of-freedom gain for data transmission is the key technology. To this end, a novel CE method to estimate full rank array response matrices is presented. The full rank array response matrices lead to the full rank reconstructed channel matrix, which provides the maximum spatial degree-of-freedom gain of the sparse mmW channels. Compared with the previously proposed CE methods which use transmit or receive diversity rather than spatial degrees of freedom, the proposed one shows significant increase of data rates as SNR is getting larger.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","startPage":"42","endPage":"48","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600852.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full rank spatial channel estimation at millimeter wave systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Noise measurement","Channel estimation","Transmitters","Receivers","Arrays","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","matrix algebra","multipath channels","radiocommunication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full rank spatial channel estimation","millimeter wave system","CE method","hybrid beamforming architecture","mmW link","multiple channel paths","maximum spatial degree-of-freedom gain","data transmission","full rank array response matrix estimation","full rank reconstructed channel matrix","sparse mmW channel","SNR","wireless communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Full rank spatial channel estimation at millimeter wave systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600852/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600852/","accessionNumber":"16408811","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full rank spatial channel estimation at millimeter wave systems","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570279626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064629S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7600873,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Varela Santana","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Ch\u00e2tillon, France"],"firstName":"Thomas Varela","lastName":"Santana","id":"37085890845"},{"name":"Ana Galindo-Serrano","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Ch\u00e2tillon, France"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Galindo-Serrano","id":"38277739800"},{"name":"Berna Sayrac","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Ch\u00e2tillon, France"],"firstName":"Berna","lastName":"Sayrac","id":"37294242600"},{"name":"Sof\u00eda Mart\u00ednez L\u00f3pez","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Ch\u00e2tillon, France"],"firstName":"Sof\u00eda Mart\u00ednez","lastName":"L\u00f3pez","id":"38256268900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600873","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"abstract":"One of the envisaged candidates technologies to be used in next generation mobile networks is the integration of a large number of antennas at the Base Station (BS), known as Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO). Massive MIMO can focus the energy on a user or group of users to improve their throughput and the network capacity. An approach of this technology focuses on the creation of coverage areas with the size of a pico-cell, called Virtual Small Cells (VSCs). Their main advantage is that they allow increasing the network capacity while avoiding the deployment cost of new small BSs. Identifying the dense traffic areas in real time and serving them in a responsive way is a key challenge to be address. Our work focuses on dynamically identifying the dense traffic areas so that the VSCs can be implemented and adjust their coverage. To conduct this research we use the K-means method and propose an algorithm that dynamically determines the hotspot parameters for VSCs, i.e., center and radius in order to optimize the overall capacity of the mobile network. Note that this algorithm could be used to identify any group of users.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Distortion","MIMO","Optimization","Estimation","Mobile computing","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","next generation networks","picocellular radio","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic network configuration","hotspot identification","virtual small cell","next generation mobile network","base station antennas","massive multiple-input multiple-output system","massive MIMO system","VSC throughput improvement","pico-cell traffic","BS antennas","K-means method","mobile network overall capacity optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","virtual small cells","cluster identification","dense networks","K-means"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600873","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600873.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic network configuration: Hotspot identification for Virtual Small Cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic network configuration: Hotspot identification for Virtual Small Cells","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600873/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600873/","accessionNumber":"16408805","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic network configuration: Hotspot identification for Virtual Small Cells","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570279637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065672S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7600874,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Taghizadeh","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Taghizadeh","id":"37085466197"},{"name":"Tianyu Yang","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"lastName":"Tianyu Yang","id":"37085903762"},{"name":"Ali Cagatay Cirik","affiliation":["The University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine, Vancouver, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Ali Cagatay","lastName":"Cirik"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600874","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600874","abstract":"In this work we study the behavior of a full-duplex (FD) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relay with multiple antennas, where hardware impairments of the FD transceivers are taken into account.

An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the end-to-end communication rate, under relay and source transmit power constraints. Due to the resulting problem complexity, we propose a gradient-projection-based algorithm to approach an optimum solution. An iterative relay transmit covariance shaping algorithm is also proposed, following the quadratic approximation of the relay function in each iteration. The aforementioned algorithm provides a convex optimization framework to approach an optimal solution with small number of optimization iterations.

In the proposed design, the constellation of the second user is optimally rotated with the assumption that joint maximum-likelihood detection is employed at the receiver. With M antennas at the receiver, closed-form expressions for the optimal angles as a function of M, the channel conditions and the users' power levels are derived for 4-QAM constellation. Using rotated constellation, the performance of NOMA in terms of bit-error-rate is shown to be improved. The proposed approach is applicable in the uplink NOMA where users share the same time/frequency channel or in the downlink NOMA where users are multiplexed in the power domain.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600876.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On joint modulation design in two-user non-orthogonal multiple access channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Receiving antennas","Downlink","Uplink","Optimized production technology","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","multi-access systems","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on joint modulation design","two-user nonorthogonal multiple access channels","joint signal optimization","two-user NOMA channels","finite-alphabet constellations","second user constellation","joint maximum-likelihood detection","user power levels","4-QAM constellation","rotated constellation","bit-error-rate","time-frequency channel","downlink NOMA","power domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["modulation","non-orthogonal multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On joint modulation design in two-user non-orthogonal multiple access channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600876/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408772","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On joint modulation design in two-user non-orthogonal multiple access channels","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570279695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051401S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600878,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Al-Imari","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics R&D Institute UK, Staines-upon-Thames, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Al-Imari","id":"38274981200"},{"name":"Belkacem Mouhouche","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics R&D Institute UK, Staines-upon-Thames, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Belkacem","lastName":"Mouhouche","id":"37269250100"},{"name":"Maziar Nekovee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics R&D Institute UK, Staines-upon-Thames, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Maziar","lastName":"Nekovee","id":"37303754000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600878","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"abstract":"5G wireless networks have received a lot of attention recently where different key performance indicators (KPIs) are addressed. Two of the major KPIs are the data throughput and the number of supported users. These KPIs are taken into account in the design of modulation and coding techniques. One of the most promising techniques for interference limited scenarios is frequency quadrature amplitude modulation (FQAM). FQAM improves user throughputs at cell-edge where interference is the limiting factor by using only some of the available frequency subcarriers. However, FQAM was mostly studied in downlink settings. Furthermore, FQAM is an orthogonal multiple access scheme that limits the number of users that can access the frequency resources, where each resource can be used by one user only. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access technique for the uplink of future 5G systems that is based on FQAM but relaxes the constraint of user orthogonality. More than one user can independently access the same set of frequency resources. Since the technique is proposed in the uplink where the computational complexity at the base station is not a major hurdle, we also propose to use iterative multiuser detection and decoding in order to improve the performance and better separate the overlapping users. Simulation results show that this technique significantly increases the number of supported users as well as the total system throughput compared with orthogonal transmission techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600878.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-orthogonal FQAM for multiple access in the uplink of 5G wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Decoding","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Iterative decoding","Uplink","Receivers","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","computational complexity","frequency modulation","iterative decoding","modulation coding","multi-access systems","multiuser detection","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G wireless network uplink","nonorthogonal FQAM","key performance indicator","KPI","data throughput","modulation coding technique","interference limited scenario","frequency quadrature amplitude modulation","user throughput improvement","orthogonal multiple access scheme","user orthogonality constraint","computational complexity","base station","iterative multiuser detection","iterative decoding","total system throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access","frequency quadrature amplitude modulation","multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Non-orthogonal FQAM for multiple access in the uplink of 5G wireless networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600878/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408800","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-orthogonal FQAM for multiple access in the uplink of 5G wireless networks","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570279756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04816S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600880,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The attractiveness of using such a system for millimeter Wave (mmWave) transmissions comes partly from the reduced size of a many antenna base station. Furthermore, the beamforming gains that they allow is highly suited to combat the high path losses experienced at such wavelengths. Unfortunately the complexity to implement a mmWave Massive MIMO system comes with the difficulty to have a high number of stacked Radio Frequency (RF) chains. Hybrid Analog and Digital Beamforming systems have then emerged to retain a high number of antennas without as many RF chains in order to keep high beamforming gains. In this paper we first describe a User Equipment (UE) solution allowing the system to form a beam that adapts to its own movement so that it always focuses its energy toward the base station, using an on board analog array and an Inertial Measurement Unit. Then we compare the performance of the known Hybrid solution with a fully digital Massive MIMO system, having as many RF chains as the Hybrid system, but serving UEs with beamforming abilities. Mostly we emphasize how such a system allows for great flexibility and evolution, both traits being invaluable features in many future networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600880","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600880.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison between a hybrid digital and analog beamforming system and a fully digital Massive MIMO system with adaptive beamsteering receivers in millimeter-Wave transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600880/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison between a hybrid digital and analog beamforming system and a fully digital Massive MIMO system with adaptive beamsteering receivers in millimeter-Wave transmissions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408836","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600880/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison between a hybrid digital and analog beamforming system and a fully digital Massive MIMO system with adaptive beamsteering receivers in millimeter-Wave transmissions","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570279817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051517S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600882,"authors":[{"name":"Mesut Toka","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Gebze Technical University, Gebze-Kocaeli, Turkey","Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Nigde University, Nigde, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mesut","lastName":"Toka","id":"37085658363"},{"name":"O\u011fuz Kucur","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Gebze Technical University, Gebze-Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"O\u011fuz","lastName":"Kucur","id":"37304195400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600882","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relay networks (telecommunications)","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Fading channels","Receiving antennas","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","diversity reception","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","probability","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage performance","dual hop full-duplex MIMO relay network","Rayleigh fading channel","end-to-end outage probability","e2e OP","amplify-and-forward relay network","AF relay network","transmit antenna selection","TAS","maximal-ratio combining","MRC","multiple antennas","signal transmission","residual self-interference effect","RSI effect","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual hop networks","Full-duplex","Amplify-and-forward","Transmit antenna selection","Maximal-ratio combining"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate end-to-end (e2e) outage probability (OP) performance of dual hop full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network with transmit antenna selection (TAS) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) over independent identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. In the network, source and destination are equipped with multiple antennas, and communicate with each other via a single relay, which is equipped with one receive and one transmit antennas.

For signal transmission, TAS is used at the source by neglecting residual self-interference (RSI) effect and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) technique is employed at the destination for combining received signals. In order to simplify the theoretical derivations, we also investigate the e2e OP in case that the RSI is non-fading. OP expression is derived in integral form for the Rayleigh faded RSI effect. Moreover, in case of non-fading RSI effect, OP expression is derived in closed form.

Clipping algorithms are used for dealing with the high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR), while taking care on fulfilling requirements for signal integrity and spectral masks. The fragmented spectrum scenario imposes a special challenge to all waveforms, as band gaps may be filled with clipping noise when using conventional clipping algorithms. We show that by applying the so-called content aware clipping technique to UF-OFDM, we are able to support also narrow band gaps with attenuations in the order of 50 dB. Measurement results for PAPR, error vector magnitude (EVM) and symbol error rate are provided. We show that in general, existing signal conditioning algorithms work smoothly with the UF-OFDM waveform and its DFT-spread variant.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of RF transmitter hardware on 5G waveforms: Signal conditionings for UF-OFDM","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600892","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600892.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Impact of RF transmitter hardware on 5G waveforms: Signal conditionings for UF-OFDM","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600892/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408774","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of RF transmitter hardware on 5G waveforms: Signal conditionings for UF-OFDM","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570283449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058464S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600894,"authors":[{"name":"Maximilian Matth\u00e9","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Matth\u00e9","id":"37085424897"},{"name":"Dan Zhang","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085575597"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600894","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Decoding","Interference","Iterative decoding","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","channel coding","decoding","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","iterative methods","MIMO communication","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","signal detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere-decoding aided SIC","coded performance analysis","multiple-input multiple-output detection algorithm","high-performance mobile communication","generalized frequency division multiplexing","3-dimensional interference","nonorthogonal waveform","space diversity","iterative receiver","noniterative receiver design","sphere decoding-based MIMO-GFDM detection algorithm","SD-based detection","intersymbol interference","ISI","intercarrier interference","ICI","interantenna interference","IAI","signal demapper","channel decoder","successive interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection algorithms are of great importance for high-performance mobile communications and future waveforms need to be MIMO capable. Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM), as a promising non-orthogonal waveform, includes 3-dimensional interference which was shown to be beneficial in terms of exploiting time, frequency and space diversity for improved performance while iterative receivers have been presented to attain this gain. This paper considers non-iterative receiver design. Without relying on the feedback information from the decoder, we improve a previously proposed sphere decoding (SD) based MIMO-GFDM detection algorithm and analyze its performance in the coded case. The results show that the proposed algorithm cannot compete with SD based detection for OFDM because of intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) in addition to interantenna interference (IAI). These observations indicate that considering the GFDM MIMO detector as a joint operation between signal demapper and channel decoder is more promising for exploiting the foreseen capacity gains than trying to optimize the functional units separately.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sphere-decoding aided SIC for MIMO-GFDM: Coded performance analysis","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600894","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600894.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sphere-decoding aided SIC for MIMO-GFDM: Coded performance analysis","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600894/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408751","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sphere-decoding aided SIC for MIMO-GFDM: Coded performance analysis","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570283540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062241S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600895,"authors":[{"name":"Ljiljana Marijanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion","Institute of Telecommunications, Technische Universit\u00e4t (TU) Wien"],"firstName":"Ljiljana","lastName":"Marijanovi\u0107","id":"37085895051"},{"name":"Stefan Schwarz","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion","Institute of Telecommunications, Technische Universit\u00e4t (TU) Wien"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schwarz","id":"37401877600"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Technische Universit\u00e4t (TU) Wien"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600895","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE equalization for FBMC transmission over doubly-selective channels","abstract":"This paper presents a linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer for Filter bank Multicarrier (FBMC) systems for the equalization of fast-fading frequency-selective channels.

Cloud storage systems typically rely on expensive infrastructure with centralized control to store, repair and access the data. This approach introduces a large delay for accessing and storing the data driven in part by a high RTT between users and the cloud. These characteristics are at odds with the massive increase of devices and generated data in coming years as well as the requirements of low latency in many applications. We focus on characterizing optimal solutions for maintaining data availability when nodes in the fog continuously leave the network. In contrast with state-of-the-art data repair formulations, which assume that additional nodes will be available, we focus on an unaddressed problem: performing a repair within the pool of surviving nodes because no new/alternative nodes are available. We provide a mathematical characterization under different storage and network use conditions and develop a practical P2P system that achieves the predicted performance within 1 dB in measurement campaigns using commercial devices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On network coded distributed storage: How to repair in a fog of unreliable peers","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600898","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600898.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On network coded distributed storage: How to repair in a fog of unreliable peers","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600898/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397836","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On network coded distributed storage: How to repair in a fog of unreliable peers","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570283956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042897S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600901,"authors":[{"name":"Guillermo Pocovi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Pocovi","id":"37085493143"},{"name":"Klaus I.

Results show that at low system loads using a short TTI (e.g. 0.25 ms) is an attractive solution to achieve low latency communications (LLC). The main benefits come from the low transmission delay required to transmit the payloads. However, as the load increases, longer TTI configurations with lower relative control overhead (and therefore higher spectral efficiency) provide better performance as these better cope with the non-negligible queuing delay.

The requirement of complete channel information is hence imperative for such systems to implement those routines to approach its capacity limit. Thanks to the millimeter wave band, the sparse nature of the channel can be well exploited such that the problem of channel estimation could be formulated as sparse signal recovery problem. In this paper, we offer a simple and comprehensive solution to the above mentioned problem using the principle of basis pursuit denoise (BPDN) that aims to find a sparse solution.

Both have shown great potential to satisfy the ambitious requirements of modern wireless cellular systems in terms of area spectral efficiency whereby users located anywhere in the cell, even at the edge, should be able to obtain reasonably large throughput. The proper selection of the SFR configuration parameters is a crucial task to reach a satisfactory network performance. This paper proposes a framework with a per-cell SFR configuration instead of the conventional global SFR configuration. An optimization tool able to find these configurations is needed since the exhaustive search, in this context, is computationally prohibitive. To this end, an evolutionary (i.e. genetic) algorithm is suitably adapted to the multiobjective problem of trying to simultaneusly optimize overall and cell-edge user throughputs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the conventional setups both in terms of total capacity and fairness while remaining computationally feasible.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600907.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization of frequency reuse schemes in CoMP-based MIMO-OFDMA networks","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600907","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization of frequency reuse schemes in CoMP-based MIMO-OFDMA networks","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408778","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7600907/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization of frequency reuse schemes in CoMP-based MIMO-OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570284296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083264S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600908,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Abdullahi","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems (ICS), Home of 5G Innovation Centre University of Surrey Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Abdullahi","id":"37085890488"},{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems (ICS), Home of 5G Innovation Centre University of Surrey Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37268994500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600908","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"abstract":"Multiple input multiple output-Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) is a viable solution for providing high data rate services in harsh channel environments. The optimum receivers for them are those based on the maximum likelihood criterion. However, they have a prohibitive complexity especially when channel dimensions are high and coding is employed. Zero Forcing (ZF) and Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) receivers on the other hand provide practicable and low complexity solutions for detection, but require soft demappers to deduce the soft bits information contained in each of the received symbols. In this work, we present the ZF and MMSE receiver analysis of a bit interleaved and coded MIMO-OFDM system and propose a soft output demapper based on MMSE equalizer output to demap the information needed for viterbi decoding. A comparison of the proposed soft demapper with conventional soft demappers in literature show a significant performance improvement. We also noticed that it is more advantageous to apply the proposed demapper on a MIMO-OFDM system employing higher modulation schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600908.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"246","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis and soft demapping for coded MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Modulation","Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft demapping","coded MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple-input multiple-output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","optimum receivers","maximum likelihood criterion","channel dimension","zero forcing receiver","linear minimum mean square error","ZF receiver","linear MMSE receivers","soft bit information","bit interleaved MIMO-OFDM system","MMSE equalizer","Viterbi decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis and soft demapping for coded MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600908/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408750","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis and soft demapping for coded MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570284330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068652S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600909,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Soszka","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Soszka","id":"37085811788"},{"name":"Meryem Simsek","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Meryem","lastName":"Simsek","id":"37396279400"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37077342100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600909","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Parity check codes","Reliability","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity methods","Fading channels","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","diversity reception","frequency-domain analysis","parity check codes","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on link combining method","wireless communication reliability","fifth generation wireless system","5G wireless system","low-latency wireless connections","machine-type communication","industrial automation","channel diversity","frequency domain","diversity combining method","low-density parity-check codes","LDPC code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reliability","latency","channel diversity","outage probability","diversity combining methods","Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes","multiconnectivity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600909","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600909","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","abstract":"The future fifth generation (5G) wireless system is expected not only to provide high throughput and coverage but also to enable highly reliable and low-latency wireless connections that are required in mission critical use cases, e.g., machine-type communication or industrial automation.

However, ML decoder may be infeasible for practical implementation due to its exponential complexity especially when the number of antennas or the constellation size is large. Lattice reduction (LR) aided linear decoders are known to have much lower complexity while achieving near-optimal bit-error-rate (BER) performance in MIMO V-BLAST systems. In this paper, LR-aided linear decoders are applied to GSM systems for the first time, but the simulation results demonstrate unsatisfactory BER performances. Thereby, two improved LR-aided linear decoders are proposed in this work. The proposed schemes achieve significant BER performance enhancement compared to that of conventional LR-aided linear decoders as well as linear decoders including zero forcing (ZF) detection and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection. Compared to the ML decoder, the proposed schemes can provide fairly lower complexities with small BER performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600910","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600910.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","startPage":"253","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity lattice reduction aided detection for generalised spatial modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity lattice reduction aided detection for generalised spatial modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600910/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408790","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7600910/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity lattice reduction aided detection for generalised spatial modulation","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570284358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068687S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600919,"authors":[{"name":"Shree Krishna Sharma","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Shree Krishna","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38489086200"},{"name":"Tadilo Endeshaw Bogale","affiliation":["Institute National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Tadilo Endeshaw","lastName":"Bogale","id":"38193311400"},{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas","id":"37265267500"},{"name":"Xianbin Wang","affiliation":["University of Western Ontario, London, Canada"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281394100"},{"name":"Long Bao Le","affiliation":["Institut national de la recherche scientifique, Quebec, QC, CA"],"firstName":"Long Bao","lastName":"Le","id":"37963357200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600919","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1396},"abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is receiving important attention from industries and research communities as an important enabler for Fifth Generation (5G) of wireless communications.

One of the important aspects here is to design the physical (PHY) layer of IoT-based wireless systems considering the practical constraints of energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and Quality of Service (QoS).

To tackle with high Vehicular Penetration Loss (VPL), unpredictable and unstable throughput, and worst case scenario onboard the HST, we investigate network performance based on descriptive statistics.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600923","startPage":"325","endPage":"329","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600923.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular network quality improvements for high speed train passengers by on-board amplify-and-forward relays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Cellular network quality improvements for high speed train passengers by on-board amplify-and-forward relays","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600923/","accessionNumber":"16408773","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600923/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular network quality improvements for high speed train passengers by on-board amplify-and-forward relays","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570294236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046177S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7600924,"authors":[{"name":"Jayashree Thota","affiliation":["Communication Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Jayashree","lastName":"Thota","id":"37085463535"},{"name":"Reham Almesaeed","affiliation":["Communication Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Reham","lastName":"Almesaeed","id":"37085352028"},{"name":"Angela Doufexi","affiliation":["Communication Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Doufexi","id":"37085367424"},{"name":"Simon Armour","affiliation":["Communication Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Armour","id":"37085388738"},{"name":"Andrew R.

Currently there is considerable interest in the design and performance of new 5G physical layer waveforms. One of the leading candidates is Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM). 5G waveforms are required to support a smooth transition from existing 4G solutions. In this paper the performance of a GFDM waveform is analysed in the context of LTE-A using the 3D 3GPP-ITU channel model. Results are directly compared with traditional OFDM solutions. Our analysis shows that GFDM achieves comparable Packet Error Rate (PER) and throughput results while introducing additional benefits such as reduced out-of-band radiation which is the key factor for the 5G cognitive applications based on dynamic spectrum access. We conclude that GFDM is a strong candidate for use in future 5G systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600925.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"340","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System level 5G evaluation of GFDM waveforms in an LTE-A platform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","5G mobile communication","Filter banks","Receivers","Interference","Time-frequency analysis","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cellular radio","cognitive radio","frequency division multiplexing","Long Term Evolution","radio spectrum management","waveform analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system level 5G evaluation","LTE-A platform","5G cellular systems","ultra-low power consumption","end-to-end latency","5G physical layer waveforms","generalized frequency division multiplexing","GFDM waveform performance analysis","3D 3GPP-ITU channel model","packet error rate","PER","5G cognitive applications","dynamic spectrum access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GFDM","OFDM","LTE-A"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"System level 5G evaluation of GFDM waveforms in an LTE-A platform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600925/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408796","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System level 5G evaluation of GFDM waveforms in an LTE-A platform","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570298590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056117S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600926,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Schnelling","affiliation":["Information Theory and Systematic Design of Communication Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Schnelling","id":"37085679050"},{"name":"Anke Schmeink","affiliation":["Information Theory and Systematic Design of Communication Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anke","lastName":"Schmeink","id":"37391595400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600926","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Hamming weight","Indexes","Upper bound","Generators","Hamming distance","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","maximum likelihood decoding","Reed-Muller codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed-Muller rule","channel polarization","capacity-achieving codes","polar codes","long-standing open problem","information theory","arbitrary symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels","target channel statistics","code construction","Reed-Muller codes","binary erasure channel","maximum a-posteriori decoding","row selections","successive cancellation decoding","varying channel conditions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600926","abstract":"Being the first provably capacity-achieving codes, polar codes present a constructive solution to a long-standing open problem in information theory.

DSM scheme aims to improve the spectral efficiency of classical SM by increasing the number of active transmit antennas. In the DSM scheme, incoming data bits determine two modulated symbols as well as their corresponding activated transmit antenna indices. One of the modulated symbols is directly transmitted over its corresponding activated transmit antenna, while the other one is transmitted with a rotation angle, which is optimized for M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) signal constellation, over the second activated transmit antenna. The error performance of the proposed DSM scheme is compared with the recently proposed emerging SM schemes such as quadrature SM (QSM) and enhanced SM (ESM). Our computer simulations show that the DSM scheme provides considerably better error performance than QSM and ESM schemes for different spectral efficiency values. In addition, the pairwise error probability (PEP) of DSM is derived and the average bit error probability (ABEP) over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels is obtained for different M-QAM constellations.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600927","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","startPage":"347","endPage":"351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double spatial modulation: A high-rate index modulation scheme for MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Double spatial modulation: A high-rate index modulation scheme for MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600927/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408771","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7600927/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double spatial modulation: A high-rate index modulation scheme for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570299812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043751S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600928,"authors":[{"name":"Arman Farhang","affiliation":["Trinity College, CONNECT, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Arman","lastName":"Farhang","id":"38272414200"},{"name":"Amir Aminjavaheri","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Aminjavaheri","id":"37085454858"},{"name":"Ahmad Rezazadeh Reyhani","affiliation":["University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, US"],"firstName":"Ahmad Rezazadeh","lastName":"Reyhani"},{"name":"Linda E.

The absence of the CP increases the bandwidth efficiency at the expense of intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI). It is known that in massive MIMO, different types of interference fade away as the number of base station (BS) antennas tends to infinity. In this paper, we investigate if the channel distortions in the absence of the CP are averaged out in the large antenna regime. To this end, we analytically study the performance of the conventional maximum ratio combining (MRC) and realize that there always remains some residual interference leading to saturation of signal to interference (SIR). This saturation of SIR is quantified through mathematical equations. Moreover, to resolve the saturation problem, we propose a technique based on time-reversal MRC with zero forcing multiuser detection (TR-ZF). Thus, the SIR of our proposed TR-ZF does not saturate and is a linear function of the number of BS antennas. We also show that TR-ZF only needs one OFDM demodulator per user irrespective of the number of BS antennas; reducing the BS signal processing complexity significantly. Finally, we corroborate our claims, as well as analytical results, through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600928","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600928.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","startPage":"352","endPage":"358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time reversal with post-equalization for OFDM without CP in massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time reversal with post-equalization for OFDM without CP in massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600928/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408844","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7600928/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time reversal with post-equalization for OFDM without CP in massive MIMO","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570300964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066296S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600929,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A framework is presented that processes input data from multiple sources and extracts, through learning-based classification, prediction and clustering models, relevant knowledge to drive the decisions made by 5G SON functionalities. Different candidate AI-based tools for knowledge discovery are identified together with the associated knowledge models that can be extracted. On this basis, the applicability of these models to a comprehensive range of 5G SON functions across the categories of self-planning, self-optimization and self-healing is analyzed. Finally, the paper identifies the research directions deriving from the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600929","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600929.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-based 5G Radio Access Network planning and optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-based 5G Radio Access Network planning and optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600929/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16408804","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600929/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-based 5G Radio Access Network planning and optimization","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570300993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055625S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7600931,"authors":[{"name":"Gilberto Berardinelli","affiliation":["Aalborg Universitet, Aalborg, DK"],"firstName":"Gilberto","lastName":"Berardinelli"},{"name":"Klaus I.

However, high quality channel estimation in ZT DFT-s-OFDM is compromised by the necessity of accommodating a zero head/tail in the transmit signal. This zero-insertion affects negatively reference sequence properties such as cyclic zero-autocorrelation and flat frequency response. In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimator for ZT DFT-s-OFDM which circumvents such limitations by enabling the correlation of the received signal against the original sequence rather than its zero-padded version. Simulation results prove the benefits in terms of mean square error (MSE) of the proposed channel estimator with respect to existing solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel channel estimator for Zero-Tail DFT-spread-OFDM","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600931","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600931.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel channel estimator for Zero-Tail DFT-spread-OFDM","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600931/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408839","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel channel estimator for Zero-Tail DFT-spread-OFDM","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570301368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052507S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600937,"authors":[{"name":"David Demmer","affiliation":["CEA-Leti Minatec, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Demmer","id":"37085906820"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Dor\u00e9","affiliation":["CEA-Leti Minatec, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Dor\u00e9","id":"37295793700"},{"name":"Didier Le Ruyet","affiliation":["Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Le Ruyet","id":"37269364300"},{"name":"Robin Gerzaguet","affiliation":["CEA-Leti Minatec, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Gerzaguet","id":"37076616200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600937","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Interference","Frequency modulation","Equalizers","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","decoding","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","precoding","quadrature amplitude modulation","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-decision linear receivers","spatial-multiplexing FBMC-OQAM","mobile data traffic","enhanced frequency localized transmissions","wireless network generation","filter bank multicarrier modulation","offset-QAM","CP-OFDM","spectral efficiency","highly-frequency selective channels","complex detection stage","precoding","multitap equalization","orthogonality loss","frequency-spreading scheme","frequency resolution","probabilistic decoding","linear FBMC receivers","polyphase network","frequency-selective LTE channel model","likelihood metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FBMC/OQAM","SM-MIMO","Linear Detection"]}],"abstract":"With the increasing demand for mobile data traffic, enhanced frequency localized transmissions are considered for the generation of wireless networks to come. Filter Bank Multi-Carrier modulation, with the use of Offset-QAM, proves to be an interesting candidate to satisfy those spectrum constraints. Contrary to CP-OFDM, FBMC does not use any CP. Its spectral efficiency is improved but it also weakens the transmissions over highly frequency selective channels. Complex detection stage based on precoding or multi-tap equalization is thus necessary to prevent orthogonality losses. Another solution can be the use of the Frequency-Spreading scheme which improves the frequency resolution. In this paper, we propose to extend probabilistic decoding to linear FBMC receivers. The performances of the two common FBMC receiver structures, PolyPhase Network and Frequency-Spreading, are assessed over frequency-selective LTE channel models.

To provide backward compatibility, OFDMA works on top of CSMA/CA, native for Wi-Fi. Although OFDMA transmission is much more efficient than traditional one, the straightforward usage of 802.11ax functionality leads to the low ratio of OFDMA uplink transmissions. This problem can be solved by changing channel access parameters, which can be done with a legacy mechanism. However, in a heterogeneous network with legacy and 802.11ax stations, this mechanism leads to severe unfairness. In the paper, we describe our recent proposal, which solves the problem, and evaluate its performance with an analytical model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Throughput","Downlink","Resource management","Optimal scheduling","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EDCA parameter set","IEEE 802.11ax networks","Wi-Fi community","backward compatibility","CSMA-CA","OFDMA uplink transmission","channel access parameter","legacy mechanism","heterogeneous network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Efficiency WLANs","IEEE 802.11ax","OFDMA","performance evaluation","fairness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600940","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600940.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Several EDCA parameter sets for improving channel access in IEEE 802.11ax networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Several EDCA parameter sets for improving channel access in IEEE 802.11ax networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600940/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600940/","accessionNumber":"16408840","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Several EDCA parameter sets for improving channel access in IEEE 802.11ax networks","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570302457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033051S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7600941,"authors":[{"name":"Ayse Betul Buyuksar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ayse Betul","lastName":"Buyuksar","id":"37085907260"},{"name":"Habib Senol","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Senol","id":"37403634900"},{"name":"Serhat Erkucuk","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Serhat","lastName":"Erkucuk","id":"37283712400"},{"name":"Hakan Ali Cirpan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hakan Ali","lastName":"Cirpan","id":"37347283800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600941","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"abstract":"In order to meet future communication system requirements, channel estimation over fast fading and frequency selective channels is crucial.

We address the robust weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem, in which the transmitted rate over an arbitrary link is maximized subject to transmit power constraints imposed at the FD base-station and UL users. A convergent iterative algorithm is proposed where the initial sum-rate and the transmit precoding are initialized primarily so as to obtain the initial weight matrices and receive filters. Afterwards, using these initial parameters, the beamforming vectors are calculated via solving the robust WSRM problem which can be casted as a second order cone programming (SOCP). At the end, the optimal achievable sum-rate is calculated from the designed parameters provided that a predefined stopping criteria is met. The proposed design is evaluated via numerical simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600950.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"475","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust weighted sum-rate maximization over full-duplex multi-user MIMO systems under imperfect CSIT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Covariance matrices","Robustness","MIMO","Interference","Precoding","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","iterative methods","mathematical programming","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","precoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-duplex multiuser MIMO system","imperfect CSIT","FD multiuser multiple input multiple output system","BS","multiple uplink user","downlink user","DL user","UL user","robust weighted sum-rate maximization problem","WSRM problem","arbitrary link","transmit power constraint","FD base station","convergent iterative algorithm","transmit precoding","initial weight matrix","receive filters","beamforming vector","second order cone programming","SOCP","predefined stopping criteria","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full duplex","imperfect CSIT","self-interference","SOCP","weighted sum-rate maximization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust weighted sum-rate maximization over full-duplex multi-user MIMO systems under imperfect CSIT","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600950/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408770","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust weighted sum-rate maximization over full-duplex multi-user MIMO systems under imperfect CSIT","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570302969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129844S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600954,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyana Gopala","affiliation":["EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Kalyana","lastName":"Gopala","id":"37085866751"},{"name":"Dirk Slock","affiliation":["EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Slock","id":"37266845200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600954","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"abstract":"Performance of OFDM systems is limited by inter carrier interference (ICI) under high Doppler scenarios such as that encountered in high speed trains such as TGV. Several publications have addressed the receiver design for SISO (single input single output) and SIMO (single input multiple output) to combat ICI. Notably, the use of multiple receive antennas is a known to be a very effective way to combat ICI. In a recent publication, the authors explored the use of transmit (Tx) antennas for ICI mitigation. It considered a MIMO (multiple input multiple output) scenario and iteratively designed a transmit beamformer to maximize the sum capacity across all the subcarriers in the presence of ICI. Another important tool in the mitigation of ICI is the exploitation of excess CP (cyclic prefix). With an appropriate window function, the excess CP at the receiver may be exploited to reduce the ICI. In this work, we extend the transmit beamformer design to include the excess CP exploitation at the receiver. We jointly optimize both the receive window coefficients and the transmit beamformer using alternating minimization. The optimal window is determined using gradient descent algorithm. The convergence of the iterative approach is proved and the theory is validated via numerical simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600954.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"496","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Doppler MIMO OFDM capacity maximizing spatial transceivers exploiting excess cyclic prefix","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Doppler effect","Interference","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","gradient methods","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high Doppler MIMO OFDM capacity","spatial transceivers","excess cyclic prefix","intercarrier interference","ICI mitigation","high-speed trains","TGV","SISO scenario","single-input single-output","SIMO scenario","single-input multiple-output","multiple-receive antennas","transmit antennas","MIMO scenario","multiple-input multiple-output scenario","sum capacity","cyclic prefix","window function","receive window coefficients","alternating minimization","gradient descent algorithm","iterative approach","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","ICI","Excess Cyclic Prefix","OFDM","Beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"High Doppler MIMO OFDM capacity maximizing spatial transceivers exploiting excess cyclic prefix","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408758","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Doppler MIMO OFDM capacity maximizing spatial transceivers exploiting excess cyclic prefix","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570292225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066897S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600956,"authors":[{"name":"Stelios Stefanatos","affiliation":["Industrial Systems Institute, Athena Research and Innovation Centre, Rion, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Stelios","lastName":"Stefanatos","id":"37392286900"},{"name":"Fotis Foukalas","affiliation":["Industrial Systems Institute, Athena Research and Innovation Centre, Rion, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Fotis","lastName":"Foukalas","id":"37284771700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600956","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Complexity theory","Transceivers","Finite impulse response filters","Decoding","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","diversity reception","OFDM modulation","precoding","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity wideband OFDM signal transmission","interband carrier aggregation","transceiver implementation","interband CA","component carrier","single CC transmission","CC diversity","digital-baseband processing","filter-bank-based architecture","transceiver complexity","precoding operation"]}],"abstract":"Typical transceiver implementation proposals for inter-band carrier aggregation (CA) suggest use of parallel independent chains, one for each of the available component carriers (CCs), which is not a scalable approach when the number of CCs increases. Aiming towards efficient transceiver architectures for CA, this paper focuses on the digital-baseband processing part of the transceiver operations and investigates the potential of a filter-bank based architecture for transmission of a single wideband OFDM waveform over multiple, concurrently operating narrowband CCs. Appropriate filter bank designs and system operational parameters are pursued in order to keep the resulting transceiver complexity comparable to that of a standard single CC transmission. It is demonstrated that there exist designs which achieve this goal and, moreover, are able to inherently exploit the maximum available CC diversity by a simple precoding operation on the transmitted signal without any rate loss due to coding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity transmission of wideband OFDM signals via inter-band carrier aggregation","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600956","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600956.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity transmission of wideband OFDM signals via inter-band carrier aggregation","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600956/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408732","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity transmission of wideband OFDM signals via inter-band carrier aggregation","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570292494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066584S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600958,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Dryjanski","affiliation":["Wireless System Design, Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Dryjanski","id":"37085584653"},{"name":"Michal Szydelko","affiliation":["Wireless System Design, Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Szydelko","id":"38570857900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600958","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Mobile computing","3GPP","Long Term Evolution","Rats","IEEE 802.11 Standard"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","radio access networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum aggregation-management framework","pre-5G applications","unified traffic steering approach","UTS approach","mobile networks","3GPP radio access scheme","radio access technology","RAT","radio level integration","spectrum resource scheme","spectrum access scheme","radio resource utilization","booming mobile data demand","mobile broadband use","traffic steering functionality","3GPP standards","UTS framework","unified 5G architecture","UTS-logic","coordinate traffic steering mechanism","operator strategy","mobile demand","SON decision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["architecture","3GPP","framework","traffic steering","UTS"]}],"abstract":"This article presents discussion behind emerging need for the Unified Traffic Steering (UTS) approach in the evolving mobile networks to efficiently handle multitude of 3GPP radio access schemes and technologies.

That is a must to allow efficient radio resources utilization in mobile networks to cope with the booming mobile data demand in evolving mobile broadband use cases. For that purpose, analysis of traffic steering functionalities was performed based on the 3GPP standards, which lead to the formulation of UTS framework.

A current-mode class-D architecture has been used to implement a DPA in which both operation conditions were examined. Two mechanisms were addressed to study the AM-AM performance of the DPA, namely the knee voltage and the output resistance of the transistor. To evaluate the impact of these parameters in the AM-AM profile, we proposed a simplified transistor model in which both parameters can be defined independently without affecting each other. This allowed us to isolate and determine the effects in the AM-AM distortion, helping to conclude that the output resistance turns out to be the most dominant parameter.

A novel DPD technique, termed as overlapped recursive error correction has been proposed in this paper for linearization of non-linearly amplified FBMC-OQAM signals.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600962","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600962.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PA linearization of FBMC-OQAM signals with overlapped recursive error correcting predistortion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600962/","displayDocTitle":"PA linearization of FBMC-OQAM signals with overlapped recursive error correcting predistortion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408741","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600962/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PA linearization of FBMC-OQAM signals with overlapped recursive error correcting predistortion","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570289067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057948S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600964,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim Penner","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Penner","id":"37085899126"},{"name":"Martin Fuhrwerk","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Fuhrwerk","id":"38490294900"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Peissig","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Peissig","id":"38526253800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600964","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Transmitters","Time measurement","Length measurement","Receivers","5G mobile communication","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","access protocols","cellular radio","channel bank filters","channel coding","decoding","quadrature amplitude modulation","radiofrequency interference","radiotelemetry","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement based evaluation","feedbackless MTC","massive machine-type communication","cellular mobile communication system","5G mobile communication system","MTD","machine-type device","feedbackless communication scheme","ALOHA channel access scheme","filter bank multicarrier","offset-QAM subcarrier modulation","FBMC-OQAM system","packet collision measurement","signal-to-interference ratio","SIR"]}],"abstract":"Massive Machine-Type Communication (MTC) is one of the main challenges for current and future cellular mobile communication systems as 5G. To overcome the controlling overhead issue of Machine-Type Devices (MTD) with low data rates and long duty cycles, we propose a feedback-less communication scheme with a pure ALOHA channel access scheme. Theoretical analysis of the user capacity of pure ALOHA have been conducted under the assumption that each collision of two or more packets renders all packets undecodable. In this contribution, we investigate the accuracy of this assumption for a Filter Bank Multi Carrier with Offset-QAM subcarrier modulation (FBMC-OQAM) system. Therefore, the effects of a 2 packet collision are measured and the influence of different Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) and packet length values are analyzed. Based on these results, a model for an N-user scenario is developed and validated by measurements. For the investigated scenario the measurement results show, that the capacity of a practical pure ALOHA channel access scheme is up to \u2248 75% higher than theoretically predicted, which renders this scheme a promising approach for massive MTC in 5G.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A measurement based evaluation of feedback-less MTC using FBMC-OQAM","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600964","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600964.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A measurement based evaluation of feedback-less MTC using FBMC-OQAM","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600964/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408827","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A measurement based evaluation of feedback-less MTC using FBMC-OQAM","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570292082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045236S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600965,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zeng","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Zeng","id":"37085891185"},{"name":"Xiangming Wen","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiangming Wen","id":"37397329700"},{"name":"Zhaoming Lu","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoming Lu","id":"37085480398"},{"name":"Yawen Chen","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yawen Chen","id":"37085366350"},{"name":"Hua Shao","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hua Shao","id":"37075649600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600965","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Power demand","Algorithm design and analysis","Array signal processing","Linear programming","Energy consumption","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cloud computing","concave programming","convex programming","energy conservation","least mean squares methods","power consumption","radio access networks","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint remote radio head activation","energy efilcient C-RAN","cloud radio access network","RRH","baseband unit pool","BBU","transmit power consumption","energy efficiency optimization","network EE optimization","green C-RAN","nonconvexity nature","weighted minimal mean square error method","WMMSE method","nonconvex EE problem","concave-convex fractional program problem","Lagrangian theory","weighted group sparse beamforming algorithm"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint remote radio head activation and beamforming for energy efficient C-RAN","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","endPage":"554","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600965","startPage":"550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600965","abstract":"The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has emerged as a promising architecture to provide extremely high throughput with fantastic energy efficiency (EE) performance. However, as all the RRHs need to be connected to the baseband unit pool (BBU) through transport links, the transmit power consumption becomes significant, which result in the demands of new researches in energy efficiency optimization. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic remote radio head (RRH) activation and network EE optimization in order to fully reap the benefits brought by Green C-RAN. First, an EE optimization problem that jointly considers RRH activation and group sparse beamforming is formulated, which is hard to solve due to its non-convexity nature. Thus, we utilize the weighted minimal mean square error (WMMSE) method to transfer the non-convex EE problem into a concave-convex fractional program problem. And the Lagrangian theory is exploited to assist the problem analysis and algorithm design. Specifically, the weighted group sparse beamforming algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, we adopt the mixed l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n=l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-norm to induce group sparsity in the beamformers, which corresponds to switching off RRHs.

One of the main challenges in this domain is to increase the secret key length, extracted from the shared channel coefficients between two legitimate communication parties, while maintaining its randomness and uniformity. In this work, we develop a practical key generation method, based on channel quantization with singular value decomposition (CQSVD), which is capable of significantly increasing the generated secret key in MIMO systems. This is achieved through quantizing the phases and amplitudes of the estimated MIMO channel coefficient's matrix by using an alternative form of SVD, where the key sequence is extracted from the orthogonal basis functions of the decomposed channel. In this method, it is shown that for an M \u00d7M antenna system, with M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n independent channel fading coefficients, a secret key sequence of length 2M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n can be generated. The extracted key sequence is transformed to a random phase sequence, which is then used to manipulate the transmitted data on a symbol level basis rather than bit level-basis, to provide more secure communication. The comparative simulation results show that the proposed CQSVD method outperforms the state of the art secret key generation methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600974","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600974.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret key generation using channel quantization with SVD for reciprocal MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600974/","displayDocTitle":"Secret key generation using channel quantization with SVD for reciprocal MIMO channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408786","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600974/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret key generation using channel quantization with SVD for reciprocal MIMO channels","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570294101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.160254S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600978,"authors":[{"name":"Li Tianze","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.

The development of mobile cloud computing shows that utilizing the unused resources of mobile devices nearby can achieve better overall system performance. As the surrounding devices are in general have limited computation resources and battery life, they may be selfish to share their resource. To solve this selfish problem, we designed a cooperation enhancement model based on Stackelberg game for ad-hoc based mobile cloud computing. First, we discussed the key elements in task offloading progress and the appropriate procedure to employ an incentive mechanism. Second, we analyzed the profits of all the devices and formulated a model based on Stackelberg game, which taken devices' states and efforts into consideration. Then, we analyzed the model and concluded that there exists a unique Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, we designed a ternary search based algorithm to reach the equilibrium which can maximize the pure profit for both the task publisher and participants. Finally, we conducted simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that our incentive mechanism can enhance the cooperation among the mobile devices, improve their profits and promote the task to be quickly completed.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600978","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600978.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stackelberg game based task offloading mechanism for ad-hoc based mobile cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7600978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600978/","displayDocTitle":"A Stackelberg game based task offloading mechanism for ad-hoc based mobile cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408788","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7600978/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stackelberg game based task offloading mechanism for ad-hoc based mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570295794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062793S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7600980,"authors":[{"name":"Quentin Bodinier","affiliation":["SCEE/IETR - CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Quentin","lastName":"Bodinier","id":"37085813168"},{"name":"Faouzi Bader","affiliation":["SCEE/IETR - CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"Bader","id":"37282298800"},{"name":"Jacques Palicot","affiliation":["SCEE/IETR - CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Palicot","id":"37269478700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2061-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2062-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7600980","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Receivers","OFDM","Demodulation","5G mobile communication","Spectral shape","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filter bank","cyclic prefix-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","spectrally localized FB waveform","incumbent CP-OFDM receiver","free radio spectrum"]}],"abstract":"A coexistence scenario between filter bank (FB) based waveforms and legacy Cyclic Prefix-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) is studied.

The base station as well as the user equipments are assumed to be equipped with single-antennas. First, we show that if the system is to be designed so as to maximize the sum-throughput, without any fairness constraint, then orthogonal transmission is optimal; and we derive the associated power split among the carriers. Second, we show that if some fairness constraint is targeted, e.g., weighted sum-throughput or some desired constraint on the reliability at the users, then non-orthogonal schemes generally outperform orthogonal schemes. In this case, we derive the corresponding optimal power allocation policy among the users and carriers. Next, focusing on reducing receiver's complexity in non-orthogonal schemes, we design a practical efficient lattice-based coding scheme for non-orthogonal access in which the entire coding complexity is placed on the transmitter side with the important advantage that the user equipment devices only realize simple single-decoder operations, i.e., no successive-interference cancellation. We describe the encoding and decoding modulo-lattice operations, along with the appropriate system parameters; and illustrate our results through some simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Encoding","Receivers","Downlink","Complexity theory","Transmitters","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","encoding","interference suppression","multi-access systems","radio networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulo-lattice coding","nonorthogonal multiple access","overloaded downlink wireless communication system","base station","single-antennas","optimal orthogonal transmission","fairness constraint","weighted sum-throughput","optimal power allocation policy","receiver complexity reduction","lattice-based coding scheme","coding complexity","user equipment devices","single-decoder operation","successive-interference cancellation","modulo-lattice operation encoding","modulo-lattice operation decoding"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7600840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600981","startPage":"633","endPage":"637","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590276/7600840/07600981.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulo-lattice coding for non-orthogonal access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modulo-lattice coding for non-orthogonal access","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16408736","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7600981/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7600981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulo-lattice coding for non-orthogonal access","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1570299898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048754S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590276","isNumber":"7600840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590276","xplore-issue":"7600840","articleId":"7600981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7600982,"authors":[{"name":"Wonjae Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Wonjae","lastName":"Shin","id":"37595072100"},{"name":"Mojtaba Vaezi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Vaezi","id":"38578389600"},{"name":"Jungwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Jungwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280330400"},{"name":"H.

For the fifth-generation (5G) communications, it is expected that the Massive MIMO system is very promising for applications and a large number of MIMO antennas will be attractive to be deployed in the smartphone to effectively increase the channel capacity. In this paper, promising compact eight MIMO antennas in the smartphone are presented. The MIMO antennas are operated in the 3.5-GHz band (3400~3600 MHz), which has been recently identified in WRC-15 for global mobile broadband services in the future. The achievable MIMO channel capacities for the proposed compact eight MIMO antennas are calculated and verified by MIMO OTA (over-the-air) testing in the open space.

However, beam selection requires the information of beamspace channel of large size. This is a challenging task, since the user mobility usually leads to the fast variation of mmWave beamspace channels, and the real-time channel estimation involves unaffordable pilot overhead. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a priori-aided (PA) channel tracking scheme. Specifically, by considering a practical user motion model, we first excavate a temporal variation law of the physical direction between the base station and each mobile user. Then, based on the special sparse structure of mmWave beamspace channels, we propose to utilize the obtained beamspace channels in the previous time slots to predict the prior information of the beamspace channel in the following time slot. Finally, aided by the obtained prior information, the time-varying beamspace channels can be tracked with low pilot overhead. Simulation results verify that the proposed PA channel tracking scheme can achieve much better performance than conventional schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589831/7601069/07601171.pdf","startPage":"1493","endPage":"1496","publicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","doi":"10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priori-aided channel tracking for millimeter-Wave beamspace massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar tracking","Meteorology","Radio frequency","Meteorological radar","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["priori-aided channel tracking","millimeter-wave beamspace massive MIMO system","RF chains","mmWave massive multiple-input multiple-output system","beam selection","user mobility","mmWave beamspace channels","channel estimation","pilot overhead","priori-aided channel tracking scheme","temporal variation law","base station","time slot","time-varying beamspace channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Priori-aided channel tracking for millimeter-Wave beamspace massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601171/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408652","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priori-aided channel tracking for millimeter-Wave beamspace massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"C5-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063952S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601193,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiming Liu","affiliation":["The 41st Research Institute of CETC, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Zhiming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085898476"},{"name":"Kunfeng Chen","affiliation":["The 41st Research Institute of CETC, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Kunfeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085906734"},{"name":"Yesheng Gao","affiliation":["The 41st Research Institute of CETC, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Yesheng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085905035"},{"name":"Fuzhou Shang","affiliation":["The 41st Research Institute of CETC, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Fuzhou","lastName":"Shang","id":"37085901434"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8801-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8802-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9983-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601193","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601193","abstract":"A theoretical model based on the genetic algorithm is proposed and presented to analyze the gain flatness-characteristics of backward-pumped distributed fiber Raman amplifier (B-DFRA).

communication has recently attracted much interest. In this paper we present radio channel measurements on campus at 3.5 GHz, which is the candidate frequency band for the 5G communications. The measurement setup is based on software radio units with a bandwidth of 30 MHz, and the measurements were conducted on campus of Beijing Jiaotong University, China. We discuss the power delay profile, path loss, shadowing, and delay spread. It is found that the path loss exponent is up to 6.16 due to high carrier frequency.

advanced wireless backhaul system based on smart beamforming (BF) is proposed. The proposed system consists of commercial Wi-Fi chipset, smart antennas based on phased array, and field programmable gate array (FPGA). The optimal BF direction is found by using optimal path-finding algorithm on the top of FPGA to control smart antennas, where optimal path-finding algorithm is a kind of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation algorithm. Auto alignment by smart BF brings the time reduction of initial installation and stable QoS in non line-of-sight (NLOS) environments. Also, the devices don't need any special tool of alignment at the installation. In addition, SWB supports point to multi-point (P2MP) topology thanks to multi-user scheduler. Field test results demonstrate that SWB not only is enough solution to provide IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi services but also is robust solution in heavy traffic environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16408513","htmlLink":"/document/7601214/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Smart beamforming based wireless backhaul for cost-effective small cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart beamforming based wireless backhaul for cost-effective small cells","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046663S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601221,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Li Chou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chang Gung University, Guishan Dist., Taoyuan City, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Min-Li","lastName":"Chou","id":"37085354023"},{"name":"Hong-Kun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chang Gung University, Guishan Dist., Taoyuan City, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hong-Kun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085887767"},{"name":"Hsien-Chin Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chang Gung University, Guishan Dist., Taoyuan City, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hsien-Chin","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37335452400"},{"name":"Fan-Hsiu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chang Gung University, Guishan Dist., Taoyuan City, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Fan-Hsiu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37276972600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8801-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8802-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9983-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601221","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":467},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601221","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Radar","Meteorology","Broadband amplifiers","Gain","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","MMIC power amplifiers","silicon compounds","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband Darlington power amplifier","gallium nitride-on-silicon carbide HEMT MMIC process","cascode topology","small signal gain characteristic","maximum output power","measured maximum gain","static DC power consumption","saturation output power","maximum power-added efficiency","size 0.5 mum","gain 15 dB","frequency 1.0 GHz to 5.8 GHz","power 330 mW","voltage 30 V","efficiency 21 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GaN","SiC","HEMT","Darlington power amplifier","broadband"]}],"abstract":"A broadband Darlington power amplifier was implemented in 0.5 \u03bcm GaN-on-SiC HEMT MMIC process.

In fact, this is even much more critical in tropical/equatorial region and at high frequencies (Ku-band and above). In this paper, we present an estimation of interfade duration in Ku- and Ka-band by applying the Stratiform-Convective Synthetic Storm Techniques (SC-SST) and a good agreement with measured statistic has been found. The performance of the prediction model in estimating interfade duration characteristic is evaluated quantitatively by means of figure of merit, and the result show RMS error of 0.91 for prediction at Ku-band. In addition, comparison of the SC-SST in equatorial region with the measurement results in temperate area for Ka-band clearly point out significant differences among two regions and also the needs of the measurement results for further validation activities in equatorial area.","doi":"10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601225","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589831/7601069/07601225.pdf","startPage":"1967","endPage":"1970","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","publicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of interfade duration for Ku- and Ka-band satellite communication system in equatorial Malaysia","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of interfade duration for Ku- and Ka-band satellite communication system in equatorial Malaysia","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16408689","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7601225/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of interfade duration for Ku- and Ka-band satellite communication system in equatorial Malaysia","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P-74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062392S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601259,"authors":[{"name":"Na Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Electromagnetics and Acoustics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, P.

It utilizes the curl-conforming linear tangential and quadratic normal (LT/QN) edge elements to expand the tangential component of the electric field, and the second order nodal-based scalar basis functions to expand the longitudinal component. Furthermore, to avoid the very fine spatial discretization of thin lossy sheet, ITBC has been proposed for the FEM formulations. The graphene plasmonic waveguide verify that the FEM with ITBC technique has high efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589831/7601069/07601259.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","doi":"10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The efficient finite element method with impedance transmission boundary condition for computing optical waveguide modes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element analysis","Optical waveguides","Meteorology","Graphene","Meteorological radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","graphene devices","nanophotonics","optical waveguides","plasmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element method","impedance transmission boundary condition","optical waveguide modes","ITBC","curl-conforming linear tangential edge elements","quadratic normal edge elements","tangential electric field component","second order nodal-based scalar basis functions","thin lossy sheet","graphene plasmonic waveguide","FEM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FEM","ITBC","Waveguide problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"The efficient finite element method with impedance transmission boundary condition for computing optical waveguide modes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601259/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408657","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The efficient finite element method with impedance transmission boundary condition for computing optical waveguide modes","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S-B14-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103208S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601264,"authors":[{"name":"Susilo Ady Saputro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Susilo Ady","lastName":"Saputro","id":"37085901796"},{"name":"Jae-Young Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Young","lastName":"Chung","id":"37085457333"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8801-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8802-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9983-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601264","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"The antenna correlation coefficient is an important indicator for MIMO antenna performance. The S-parameter-based formula is widely used to obtain the antenna correlation coefficient, instead of the original 3D-radiation-pattern-based one, to ease the measurement and calculation process. This method assumes the MIMO antennas are highly efficient, thus not suitable for a lossy MIMO antenna array built in compact handset devices. To overcome this limitation, we propose an improved S-parameter-based method including antenna's embedded and non-coupled radiation efficiencies. Using these efficiencies, the lossless S-parameters of an antenna network can be obtained and used to calculate the antenna correlation coefficient of lossy MIMO arrays. The proposed method is examined by full-wave simulation data of closely spaced printed dipole antennas with different loss factors. The results show that a more accurate estimation of the antenna correlation coefficient can be carried out compared to conventional S-parameter-based methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589831/7601069/07601264.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","doi":"10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved method for estimating antenna correlation coefficient of lossy MIMO arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Radar antennas","Antenna measurements","MIMO","Dipole antennas","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antenna arrays","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna correlation coefficient","MIMO antenna","S-parameter-based formula","printed dipole antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna correlation","antenna impedance","embedded radiation efficiency","MIMO antenna","mutual coupling","scattering parameter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An improved method for estimating antenna correlation coefficient of lossy MIMO arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408672","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved method for estimating antenna correlation coefficient of lossy MIMO arrays","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S-B2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055588S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601274,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085889978"},{"name":"Satish K.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising solution to support massive connectivity in future IoT-oriented 5G systems, where the dynamic multi-user detection (MUD) is required. In this paper, by exploiting the structured user activity sparsity, we propose the structured matching pursuit (SMP)-based dynamic MUD to jointly realize dynamic multi-user signal detection in several continuous time slots based on structured compressive sensing (SCS). Specifically, in several continuous time slots, the set of active users usually changes slowly due to continuous data transmission. Therefore, we can divide the active user sets into two different parts, i.e., the common active user set and the dynamic active user sets. Accordingly, the proposed SMP-based dynamic MUD simultaneously detects the common active user set in all time slots at first, and then the dynamic active user sets are detected in each single time slot individually. Simulation results show that the proposed SMP-based dynamic MUD can achieve much better performance than that of the conventional compressive sensing (CS)-based MUD, while they share very similar computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601297","publicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589831/7601069/07601297.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic multi-user detection based on structured compressive sensing for IoT-oriented 5G systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601297/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic multi-user detection based on structured compressive sensing for IoT-oriented 5G systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408685","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601297/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic multi-user detection based on structured compressive sensing for IoT-oriented 5G systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S-C6-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088724S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601300,"authors":[{"name":"Gilwon Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gilwon","lastName":"Lee","id":"38241159400"},{"name":"Youngchul Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngchul","lastName":"Sung","id":"37286810600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8801-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8802-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9983-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601300","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nickel","Channel models","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","millimetre waves","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receive beamforming","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink systems","mmWave multiuser MIMO downlink","transmit random beamforming","RBF scheme","receive antennas","MU multiple-input single-output systems","MU-MISO systems","transmit antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter wave systems","multiuser MIMO downlink","random beamforming","sparse MIMO channels"]}],"abstract":"The performance of transmit random beamforming (RBF) with receive beamforming at each user is investigated for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink systems.

The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be unknown at both of transmitter and receiver. Multiple transmitters, each equipped with a single antenna, represent the transmitter side and a single receiver, with a massive number of antennas, represents the other side. The receiver estimates the CSI of all the antennas using one-bit quantized received pilot signals via the least square channel estimation scheme. The estimated CSI is used to feed the antenna selection (AS) block which is responsible for selecting the used receiving antennas from the set of all available antennas. The AS is used to reduce the hardware complexity and cost of the system. Both of the maximum ratio combining and the zero forcing receiver structures are considered in the performance analysis. Soft decision and hard decision cases are also considered. The numerical analysis shows that (as an example), when the system is equipped with AS, it can save 50% of the installed radio frequency chains on the expense of a small reduction in the achievable throughput.","doi":"10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601302","publicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589831/7601069/07601302.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601069","startPage":"769","endPage":"772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter multi-user massive MIMO simplified using antenna selection and one-bit quantized channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter multi-user massive MIMO simplified using antenna selection and one-bit quantized channel estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601302/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408561","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7601302/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter multi-user massive MIMO simplified using antenna selection and one-bit quantized channel estimation","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S-C8-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046605S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601304,"authors":[{"name":"Minoru Fujishima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashi-hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Fujishima","id":"37269469900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8801-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8802-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9983-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601304","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Radio spectrum management","Radar","Channel allocation","Meteorology","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","CMOS integrated circuits","radio transmitters","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","fiber-optic-speed wireless communication","ultrahigh-speed wireless communication","CMOS transmitter","frequency 300 GHz","frequency 60 GHz","frequency 265 GHz to 275 GHz","frequency 265.68 GHz to 317.52 GHz","frequency 275 GHz to 305 GHz","bit rate 17.5 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["terahertz","wireless communication","CMOS","QAM","channel allocation","300GHz"]}],"abstract":"The unallocated frequency region above 275GHz with a vast bandwidth can potentially be utilized for ultrahigh-speed wireless communication. In particular, the 300GHz band is attractive since the propagation decay in air around 300GHz is relatively low. However, since studies on terahertz wireless communication including the 300GHz band are still at an early stage, most experiments have been performed without a specific target frequency. To promote practical use, the channel allocation and target frequency should be clarified. In this paper, the channel allocation of the 300GHz band for fiber-optic-speed wireless communication is discussed for this purpose. In the allocation, compatibility with the 60GHz band is considered. Using an allocated frequency range from 265 to 275GHz, it is found that the utilization of the frequency range from 265.68 to 317.52GHz is reasonable for the 300GHz band. This frequency region enables multiusers to enjoy fiber-optic speeds exceeding 10Gbps. Finally, an example of a CMOS transmitter for 300GHz wireless communication is demonstrated. The frequency range from 275 to 305GHz realizes six-channel wireless communication with a data rate of 17.5Gbps/ch.","doi":"10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601304","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589831/7601069/07601304.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIAP-RASC.2016.7601304","publicationTitle":"2016 URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (URSI AP-RASC)","startPage":"330","endPage":"333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel allocation of 300GHz band for fiber-optic-speed wireless communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Channel allocation of 300GHz band for fiber-optic-speed wireless communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601304/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601304/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408562","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel allocation of 300GHz band for fiber-optic-speed wireless communication","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S-D3-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050028S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7601358,"authors":[{"name":"Siat Ling Jong","affiliation":["Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Siat Ling","lastName":"Jong","id":"37061607100"},{"name":"Hong Yin Lam","affiliation":["Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hong Yin","lastName":"Lam","id":"37850363300"},{"name":"Michele D'Amico","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"D'Amico","id":"37264926600"},{"name":"Jafri Din","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Jafri","lastName":"Din","id":"37303804100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8801-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8802-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9983-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601358","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601358","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Spaceborne radar","Meteorological radar","Attenuation","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precipitation","quality of service","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Southern peninsular Malaysia","satellite propagation","precipitation","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","Johor Bahru","Stratiform","quality of service","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["equatorial","precipitation rate","rain gauge","seasonal"]}],"abstract":"This contribution investigates precipitation characteristics in Southern peninsular Malaysia, by exploiting local meteorological measurements.

of ultrasound contrast imaging with adaptive beamformer based on pulse inversion plane wave transmission","abstract":"Study of ultrasound contrast imaging is of great importance in recent years thanks to its wide application in ultrasonic diagnosis. Plane wave imaging has been considered as a good method with high frame rate and low mechanical index. High frame rate can improve the temporal resolution of contrast imaging. Meanwhile, low mechanical index is essential to contrast imaging since high mechanical index in traditional B-mode imaging could break micro-bubbles easily. However, plane wave contrast imaging suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast (CR) which leads to poor image quality. In this paper, adaptive beamformer and pulse inversion (PI) technique were combined to solve the shortcomings of the plane wave contrast imaging. For the adaptive beamformer, eigenspace based minimum variance (ESBMV) with coherence factor (ESBMVCF) was proposed.

CF, which can be considered as a scaled Wiener postfilter with high noise power weighting, provides high imaging resolution. The high resolution, however, is achieved with the contrast as a sacrifice. On other hand, Wiener postfilter, provides better signal intensity restoration and imaging contrast than CF but with lower imaging resolution. To pursue the optimal imaging contrast of Wiener postfilter and the high resolution of CF at the same time, an adaptive scaled Wiener postfilter beamformer (ASC-Wiener) is proposed. In proposed method, the noise power weighting of Wiener postfilter is adjusted adaptively so that related to the output SNR inversely needless to estimate the input SNR. Simulation and real data experiment for target point imaging show the high performance of the proposed beamformer in terms of the imaging resolution and sidelobes suppression. Cyst phantom imaging also shows that the ASC-Wiener preserves the speckle intensity and improves the imaging contrast. The contrast ratio (CR) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) are improved by 6.2/0.35 dB over ESBMV-Wiener and by 20.7/0.65 over ESBMV-CF. These results solidly prove that the imaging contrast and the imaging resolution are improved significantly and simultaneously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16408538","htmlLink":"/document/7601403/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive scaled Wiener postfilter beamformer for ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive scaled Wiener postfilter beamformer for ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S-K5b-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04447S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589831","isNumber":"7601069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589831","xplore-issue":"7601069","articleId":"7601403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601466,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Christopoulos","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Christopoulos","id":"37586630400"},{"name":"Harri Pennanen","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Harri","lastName":"Pennanen","id":"37393361400"},{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas","id":"37265267500"},{"name":"Bjorn Ottersten","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1682-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1683-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601466","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Satellites","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency allocation","interference suppression","multicast communication","pattern clustering","precoding","radiofrequency interference","satellite links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame-based multigateway satellite communication","multicast multigroup precoding","fixed multibeam broadband satellite system forward link","frequency reuse pattern","state-of-the art frame based precoding method","system performance improvement","user link capacity","point-to-point feeder link","multiple gateway deployment","intercluster interference mitigation","SINR","numerical system level simulation","energy efficiency"]}],"abstract":"The present work focuses on the forward link of fixed multibeam broadband satellite systems which employ aggressive frequency reuse patterns in the user-link. For such scenarios, the state-of-the art frame based precoding methods can improve the system performance, exploiting the super framing structure of the latest physical layer evolutions in satellite communications. Nevertheless, the limitations of feeder link need to be considered. Since the increase of the user link capacity leads to a proportional increase in the capacity requirements of the point-to-point feeder link, the deployment of multiple gateways to feed the satellite is examined. The main concept lies in each earth station being dedicated to serve a cluster of beams. In this context, the performance degradation due to inter-cluster interference is quantified. Since inter-cluster interference is expected to primarily affect cluster-edge users, the chosen performance metric is system fairness. Next, coordination between the multiple gateways is proposed as a means to mitigate interference between the different clusters and thus increase the minimum SINR over the coverage. Consequently, the gains in terms of system availability, a crucial metric in satellite communications, are exhibited via numerical system level simulations. The energy efficiency of the proposed system is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601466","publicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600989/7601463/07601466.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicast multigroup precoding for frame-based multi-gateway satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601466/","displayDocTitle":"Multicast multigroup precoding for frame-based multi-gateway satellite communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2016","accessionNumber":"16410396","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601466/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicast multigroup precoding for frame-based multi-gateway satellite communications","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"1570260688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068358S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600989","isNumber":"7601463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600989","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7601463","articleId":"7601466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601468,"authors":[{"name":"Pol Henarejos","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Pol","lastName":"Henarejos","id":"37845914000"},{"name":"Ana Perez-Neira","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Perez-Neira","id":"37085594240"},{"name":"Nicolo Mazzali","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Nicolo","lastName":"Mazzali","id":"38193000700"},{"name":"Carlos Mosquera","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Mosquera","id":"37298846800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1682-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1683-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601468","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Two dimensional displays","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Satellites","Receivers","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","interference suppression","MIMO communication","mobile satellite communication","optimisation","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","satellite links","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing technique","fixed satellite communication","mobile satellite communication","satellite link","diversity technique application","polarization domain","overlapping frequency band","four-dimensional constellation","4D constellation","forward link","coding rate","modulation order optimal tuple","MIMO scheme","throughput constraint maximization","packet error rate","radio transceiver","self-interference cancellation","full-duplex mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Satellite Communications","Polarization Diversity","Full Duplex","4D Constellations","Multimedia Communications"]}],"abstract":"Enabling ultra fast systems has been widely investigated during recent decades. Although polarization has been deployed from the beginning in satellite communications, nowadays it is being exploited to increase the throughput of satellite links. More precisely, the application of diversity techniques to the polarization domain may provide reliable, robust, and fast satellite communications. Better and more flexible spectrum use is also possible if transmission and reception can take place simultaneously in close or even overlapping frequency bands. In this paper we investigate novel signal processing techniques to increase the throughput of satellite communications in fixed and mobile scenarios. First, we investigate four-dimensional (4D) constellations for the forward link. Second, we focus on the mobile scenario and introduce an adaptive algorithm which selects the optimal tuple of modulation order, coding rate, and MIMO scheme that maximizes the throughput constraint to a maximum packet error rate. Finally, we describe the operation of radio transceivers which cancel actively the self-interference posed by the transmit signal when operating in full-duplex mode.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601468","publicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600989/7601463/07601468.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced signal processing techniques for fixed and mobile satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601468/","displayDocTitle":"Advanced signal processing techniques for fixed and mobile satellite communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2016","accessionNumber":"16410378","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601468/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced signal processing techniques for fixed and mobile satellite communications","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"1570262450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101501S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600989","isNumber":"7601463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600989","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7601463","articleId":"7601468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7601542,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Spano","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Spano","id":"37085348451"},{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas","id":"37265267500"},{"name":"Jens Krause","affiliation":["SES, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Krause","id":"37544733300"},{"name":"Bjorn Ottersten","affiliation":["SnT - securityandtrust.lu, University of Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1682-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1683-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601542","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Picture archiving and communication systems","Satellites","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","minimax techniques","precoding","radiofrequency interference","satellite antennas","satellite links","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam satellite downlink","forward downlink channel","symbol-level precoding","data information","channel state information","multiuser interference","max-min fair problem","constructive interference","per-antenna power constraints","power limitations","nonlinear channel effects","nonlinear amplifiers","detrimental saturation effect reduction","system performance optimization","signal-to-noise ratio","peak-to-average power ratio","power control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601542","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601463","publicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600989/7601463/07601542.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol-level precoding with per-antenna power constraints for the multi-beam satellite downlink","abstract":"This paper tackles the problem of multi-user interference in the forward downlink channel of a multi-beam satellite system. A symbol-level precoding scheme is considered, where the data information is used, along with the channel state information, in order to exploit the multi-user interference and transform it into useful power at the receiver side. In this framework, the max-min fair problem for constructive interference is formulated and solved, under per-antenna power constraints. The consideration of the power limitations individually for each transmitting RF chain is the novel aspect, and it is relevant in particular for systems suffering non-linear effects of the channel. This is the case of satellite systems, where the nonlinear amplifiers should be properly driven in order to reduce the detrimental saturation effect. The proposed precoding design optimizes the system performance at the receiver side in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, whilst guaranteeing the system fairness and allowing a control over the power transmitted by each antenna, in particular reducing the power peaks. Numerical results are presented to validate the proposed scheme, and to show its effectiveness in terms of distribution of the transmitted power and peak-to-average power ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7601542/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"September 2016","accessionNumber":"16410395","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Symbol-level precoding with per-antenna power constraints for the multi-beam satellite downlink","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-level precoding with per-antenna power constraints for the multi-beam satellite downlink","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"1570269099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092098S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600989","isNumber":"7601463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600989","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7601463","articleId":"7601542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7601543,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Jerkovits","affiliation":["Institute of Communication and Navigation, Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Jerkovits","id":"37085888953"},{"name":"Balazs Matuz","affiliation":["Institute of Communication and Navigation, Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), Germany"],"firstName":"Balazs","lastName":"Matuz","id":"37392269300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1682-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1683-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7601543","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","Approximation algorithms","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","interleaved codes","random codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short block","PTC","parallel turbo code design","structured approach","component code configuration","binary turbo code","code word error rate","random coding bound","RCB"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601543","abstract":"This work considers the design of short parallel turbo codes (PTCs) with block lengths in the order of (a few) hundred code bits.

We shed light on the trade-off between energy efficiency and delay-throughput gains, demonstrating that conservative adaptive approaches that favor less transmission under high erasures, might cause higher delay and less throughput gains in comparison to non-conservative approaches that favor more transmission to account for high erasures.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601546","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600989/7601463/07601546.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive network coding schemes for satellite communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Adaptive systems","Delays","Throughput","Wireless communication","Receivers","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","network coding","satellite communication","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical layer aware adaptive network coding scheme","time variant channel","energy efficiency maximization","variable modulation order","satellite communication scenario","round trip times","RTT","packet transmission","channel variation","delay-throughput gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Modulation Schemes","Energy Efficiency","Network Coding","Satellite Communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive network coding schemes for satellite communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601546/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16410377","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive network coding schemes for satellite communications","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"1570276614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038705S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600989","isNumber":"7601463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600989","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7601463","articleId":"7601546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7601548,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In DVB-S2X standard, constellations with up to 256 points have been included. However, optimizing such high order constellations is a difficult task. In this paper we propose a very simple constellation design based on the radial map from QAM constellations to non-uniform APSK constellations. Our method provides a systematic way to generate a family of optimized high order constellations. We show that gains larger than 0.5 dB can be obtained with respect to the DVB- S2X constellations with 256 points. Even though the proposed constellations are essentially sub-optimal (in terms of maximizing the mutual information), they provide a very competitive test benchmark for the performance of high order constellations. Moreover, the proposed construction potentially allows for an efficient one-dimensional soft detection by an inverse mapping to the QAM. Finally, further optimization techniques are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601550","publicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7600989/7601463/07601550.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7601463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QAM to circular isomorphic constellations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7601550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7601550/","displayDocTitle":"QAM to circular isomorphic constellations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2016","accessionNumber":"16410388","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7601550/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QAM to circular isomorphic constellations","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"1570276850.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068906S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7600989","isNumber":"7601463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7600989","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7601463","articleId":"7601550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7602853,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

A particularly useful feature of the boxcar filter is the ease of placement of (and tuning of) regular filter zeros, simply by defining (and varying) the time length of the boxcar window. This is of particular use within power system measurements to eliminate harmonics, inter-harmonics and image components from Fourier, Park and Clarke transforms, and other measurements related to power flow, power quality, protection, and converter control. However, implementation of the filter in real-time requires care, to minimise the execution time, provide the best frequency-domain response, know (exactly) the group delay, and avoid cumulative numerical precision errors over long periods. This paper reviews the basic properties of the boxcar filter, and explores different digital implementations, which have subtle differences in performance and computational intensity. It is shown that generally, an algorithm using trapezoidal integration and interpolation has the most desirable characteristics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMPS.2016.7602853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602798","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Applied Measurements for Power Systems (AMPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Applied Measurements for Power Systems (AMPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585854/7602798/07602853.pdf","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Choice and properties of adaptive and tunable digital boxcar (moving average) filters for power systems and other signal processing applications","doi":"10.1109/AMPS.2016.7602853","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7602853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Choice and properties of adaptive and tunable digital boxcar (moving average) filters for power systems and other signal processing applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602853/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16409605","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7602853/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choice and properties of adaptive and tunable digital boxcar (moving average) filters for power systems and other signal processing applications","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570289149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124785S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585854","isNumber":"7602798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585854","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7602798","articleId":"7602853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7602886,"authors":[{"name":"Yaakov Buchris","affiliation":["Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Yaakov","lastName":"Buchris","id":"37660813700"},{"name":"Israel Cohen","affiliation":["Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37274584400"},{"name":"Jacob Benesty","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Benesty","id":"37274630700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2007-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7602886","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Sensors","Broadband communication","Frequency-domain analysis","Microphone arrays","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["first-order differential microphone arrays","first-order DMA","real-time communications","time-domain broadband beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone arrays","differential microphone arrays (DMAs)","time-domain broadband beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Differential microphone arrays (DMAs) have a great potential to overcome some of the problems of additive arrays and provide high spatial gain relative to their small size.

In conventional MNMF, the complex spectra of observed mixture signals are assumed to be complex Gaussian distributed and are decomposed into the product of the power spectra, temporal activations, and spatial correlation matrices of individual sources in such a way that the complex Gaussian likelihood is maximized. Since the mixture spectra usually include outliers, we propose MNMF based on the complex Student's t likelihood, called t-MNMF, including the original MNMF as a special case. The parameters of t-MNMF can be iteratively optimized with an efficient multiplicative updating algorithm. Experiments showed that t-MNMF with a certain range of degrees of freedom tends to be insensitive to parameter initialization and outperform conventional MNMF.","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602889","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Student's t multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization for blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7602889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Student's t multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization for blind source separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602889/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409749","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7602889/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Student's t multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization for blind source separation","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087148S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7602891,"authors":[{"name":"Lie Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Lie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37310120000"},{"name":"Chiu-Sing Choy","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chiu-Sing","lastName":"Choy","id":"37270085300"},{"name":"Yi-Wen Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yi-Wen","lastName":"Li","id":"37085888886"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2007-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7602891","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":675},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7602891","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Training","Rectifiers","Speech enhancement","Biological neural networks","Noise measurement","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","rectifiers","regression analysis","signal denoising","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep sparse rectifier neural networks","speech denoising","speech recognition","speech enhancement","rectified linear units","ReLU","regularization coefficient","DNN regression model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech denoising","rectifier neurons","sparseness","network pruning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602891","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602891.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep sparse rectifier neural networks for speech denoising","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in speech recognition and enhancement.

Utilizing the sparseness of sound signals in the time-frequency domain is a successful approach to source separation that enables us to perform separation based on spatial features obtained from a microphone array. On the other hand, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is also a promising approach for audio source separation, which performs separation based on spectral features. This paper incorporates the idea of NMF into sparseness-based source separation and proposes a novel approach to multichannel source separation based on both spatial and spectral features. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method improves the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) by 0.26 dB and the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) by 1.96 dB compared with a conventional sparseness-based approach. In addition, our proposed model eliminates the need for a number of matrix inversions thanks to the sparseness assumption, and thereby requires a much lower computational cost than a previously-proposed multichannel NMF approach, which also utilizes spectral and spatial features.","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602917","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602917.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparseness-based multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization for blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7602917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparseness-based multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization for blind source separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602917/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409786","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7602917/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparseness-based multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization for blind source separation","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058031S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7602920,"authors":[{"name":"Henning Schepker","affiliation":["Signal Processing Group, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Schepker","id":"37085506899"},{"name":"Linh T.

While theoretically allowing for perfect feedback cancellation, in practice the solution is typically biased due to the closed-loop acoustical system. In this paper, we propose to use a fixed beamformer to cancel the acoustic feedback for an earpiece with multiple integrated microphones and loudspeakers. By steering a spatial null in the direction of the hearing aid loudspeaker we show that theoretically perfect feedback cancellation can be achieved. Experimental results using measured acoustic feedback paths from an earpiece with two microphones in the vent and a third microphone in the concha show that the proposed fixed beamformer provides a reduction of the acoustic feedback and substantially increases the added stable gain while maintaining a high perceptual speech quality even for unknown acoustic feedback paths, e.g., after repositioning of the earpiece or with a telephone receiver close to the ear.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602920.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic feedback cancellation for a multi-microphone earpiece based on a null-steering beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7602920/","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic feedback cancellation for a multi-microphone earpiece based on a null-steering beamformer","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409821","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic feedback cancellation for a multi-microphone earpiece based on a null-steering beamformer","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070912S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7602921,"authors":[{"name":"Jakub Jansk\u00fd","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechatronics, Technical University of Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Jansk\u00fd","id":"37085883390"},{"name":"Zbyn\u011bk Koldovsk\u00fd","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechatronics, Technical University of Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zbyn\u011bk","lastName":"Koldovsk\u00fd","id":"38578968400"},{"name":"Nobutaka Ono","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics (NII), SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobutaka","lastName":"Ono","id":"37280832000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2007-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7602921","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7602921","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Transforms","Microphones","Time-domain analysis","Reverberation","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","speech processing","transforms","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computationally cheaper method","blind speech separation","AuxIVA","incomplete demixing transform","auxiliary-function based algorithm for independent vector analysis","frequency bins","speech signals","convex optimization problem","LASSO","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602921","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602921.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computationally cheaper method for blind speech separation based on AuxIVA and incomplete demixing transform","abstract":"This paper proposes a modification of an auxiliary-function based algorithm for Independent Vector Analysis (AuxIVA) by applying it to a constrained set of frequency bins where the activity of (speech) signals is high.

Specifically when applying minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) weights designed for a diffuse noise-field, high gains are attainable in theory. A classical result relating to the far-field regime states that the gain with respect to diffuse noise (i.e., the directivity factor) for a source in the endfire direction may approach the number of sensors squared (N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n). However, as the wavelength increases, the beamformer encounters increasingly severe robustness issues. Results pertaining to the near-field regime are less well known. In this paper we analyze MVDR beamforming in a generic dual-microphone array scenario. Our analysis is not restricted to the far-field regime. We derive precise expressions for the directivity factor and the white-noise gain, as well as simplified approximations for the near- and far-field regimes. We show that in the near-field regime the directivity factor approaches infinity as the wavelength increases, and that the white-noise gain depends only on the ratio between the distance from the source to the distance between sensors. These properties of the beamformer (BF) behave differently than in the far-field regime.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602926.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a dual microphone superdirective beamformer and approximate expressions for the near-field propagation regime","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7602926/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a dual microphone superdirective beamformer and approximate expressions for the near-field propagation regime","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409777","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a dual microphone superdirective beamformer and approximate expressions for the near-field propagation regime","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04678S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7602928,"authors":[{"name":"Zbyn\u011bk Koldovsk\u00fd","affiliation":["Technicka univerzita v Liberci, Liberec, Liberec Region, CZ"],"firstName":"Zbyn\u011bk","lastName":"Koldovsk\u00fd"},{"name":"Francesco Nesta","affiliation":["Conexant System, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Nesta","id":"37543313700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2007-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7602928","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Covariance matrices","Program processors","Blind source separation","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio recording","audio signal processing","covariance analysis","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","microphones","parallel processing","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate MVDR","MMSE beamformer","scale-invariant signal reconstruction","microphone","minimum variance distortionless response","minimum mean-squared error","array processor","multichannel recording","directional source","sidelobe canceler structure","blocking matrix","auxiliary method","adaptive interference canceler","voice activity detector","source/noise covariance","scale-invariant least square estimator","speech activity","signal-to-noise ratio","six-channel recordings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum Variance Distortionless Beam-former","Minimum Mean Square Error Beamformer","Blind Source Separation","Scaling Ambiguity"]}],"abstract":"Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) and Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) beamformers are popular array processors for enhancing multichannel recordings of a directional source.

In this work, the RCTF coefficients are modeled by a first-order Markov chain, which is well-suited to model time-varying scenarios. The RCTF coefficients are estimated online by a Kalman filter and are then used to compute the late reverberation PSD, which is used in a spectral enhancement filter to achieve dereverberation and noise reduction.

Commonly, the quality of the signals is enhanced applying delay and sum beamforming (or variants) to a microphone array. However, under particular conditions, the multi-path acoustic propagation leading to reverberation is not completely detrimental and can be used in a constructive way. In this direction, mirrored (virtual) microphones have been successfully applied in various research areas. In addition, the majority of naturally occurring sound sources, such as the human speaker, presents a certain degree of radiation directivity, which, coupled with data-independent beamforming, has been shown to slightly increase the captured speech quality. Building upon the concepts of environment awareness and the acoustic rake receiver, this paper investigates the use of mirrored microphones, associated to isolated and strong reflections, in combination with source directivity, to further improve the captured speech quality. Real-data gathered with a linear nested array, as well as simulated data, are used to test the proposed scheme, showing superior performance with respect to similar state of the art solutions.","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602932","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602932.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602932","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing the environment-awareness of rake beamforming for directive acoustic sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7602932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Increasing the environment-awareness of rake beamforming for directive acoustic sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602932/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7602932/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409763","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing the environment-awareness of rake beamforming for directive acoustic sources","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079382S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7602934,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this way, we can properly stimulate the brain functions for sound segregation, localization, and recognition. This paper, firstly, stresses two particular forms of spatial cues distortions that occur with bilateral (i.e., independently operating) hearing aids at the left and right ear. We secondly introduce a rigorous derivation of a cue-preserving linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filter for acoustic noise reduction based on the general concept of the common spectral gain function. The proposed filter is then applied to a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and compared with other gain functions, including the bilateral type. We find that our cue-preserving MMSE filter not only maintains the spatial auditory scene, but also turns out advantageous in terms of SNR improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7602941/","accessionNumber":"16409772","displayDocTitle":"Cue-preserving MMSE filter for binaural speech enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cue-preserving MMSE filter for binaural speech enhancement","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094762S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7602943,"authors":[{"name":"Shlomo E.

While most speech enhancement algorithms overlook the phoneme structure of the speech signal, our proposed framework comprises a set of phoneme-specific DNNs (pDNNs), one for each phoneme, together with an additional phoneme-classification DNN (cDNN). The cDNN is responsible for determining the posterior probability that a specific phoneme was uttered. Concurrently, each of the pDNNs estimates a phoneme-specific speech presence probability (pSPP). The speech presence probability (SPP) is then calculated as a weighted averaging of the phoneme-specific pSPPs, with the weights determined by the posterior phoneme probability. A soft spectral attenuation, based on the SPP, is then applied to enhance the noisy speech signal. We further propose a compound training procedure, where each pDNN is first pre-trained using the phoneme labeling and the cDNN is trained to classify phonemes. Since these labels are unavailable in the test phase, the entire network is then trained using the noisy utterance, with the cDNN providing phoneme classification. A series of experiments in different noise types verifies the applicability of the new algorithm to the task of speech enhancement. Moreover, the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes that either do not consider the phoneme structure or use simpler training methodology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A phoneme-based pre-training approach for deep neural network with application to speech enhancement","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602943","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602943.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7602943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A phoneme-based pre-training approach for deep neural network with application to speech enhancement","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7602943/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409757","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A phoneme-based pre-training approach for deep neural network with application to speech enhancement","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12545S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7602949,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoko Kawase","affiliation":["NTT Corporation, NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoko","lastName":"Kawase","id":"37085772575"},{"name":"Kenta Niwa","affiliation":["NTT Corporation, NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenta","lastName":"Niwa","id":"37861194300"},{"name":"Kazunori Kobayashi","affiliation":["NTT Corporation, NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"38089900700"},{"name":"Yusuke Hioka","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Hioka","id":"38565532300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2007-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7602949","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"abstract":"The Wiener filter has been used as a post-filter applied to the output of beamforming, which boosts the overall performance of sound source enhancement.

tunable beamformer for robust superdirective beamforming","abstract":"Conventional superdirective beamforming is a well-known multi-microphone enhancement method with superior directivity factor (DF). However, it suffers from an inferior white noise gain (WNG), which is expressed by high sensitivity to uncorrelated noise and array inaccuracies. In this work, a beamformer with tunable superdirective gain is introduced. The proposed approach plays a role of a regularized superdirective beamformer, where instead of constraining the WNG, we minimize both white noise and diffuse noise energy in the optimization problem. In addition, by using a tunable regularization parameter, we control the amount of the beamformer DF and WNG. This single boresight solution is then extended to a multiple linear constraint beamformer, with any user-determined spatial or frequency constraints. The beamformer gain response simulations exhibit a robust and controllable solution with an efficient DF/WNG tradeoff.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602952/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16409767","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7602952/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A tunable beamformer for robust superdirective beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tunable beamformer for robust superdirective beamforming","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05861S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7602953,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Meier","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU)"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Meier","id":"38490713900"},{"name":"Walter Kellermann","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU)"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Kellermann","id":"37274601000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2007-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7602953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Estimation","Size control","Loudspeakers","Noise measurement","Signal processing algorithms","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","echo suppression","least mean squares methods","neurocontrollers","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relative impulse response estimation","doubletalk","artificial neural network-based step size control","normalized least-mean squares","NLMS algorithm","linear system identification","acoustic echo cancellation","AEC","acoustic path","loudspeaker","microphone","background noise","additive noise","microphone signal","RIR estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["System Identification","Step Size Adaptation","Artificial Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7602953","abstract":"The Normalized Least-Mean Squares (NLMS) algorithm is a widely used method for linear system identification (e.g., for Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC), where the acoustic path between loudspeaker and microphone needs to be estimated). As soon as interferers or background noise are active, step size control becomes a crucial task in order to ensure a fast but stable adaptation. Conventional step size control methods address the case of additive noise contaminating the system output, i.e., microphone signal. When the NLMS algorithm is used for Relative Impulse Response (RIR) estimation, however, both the input signal and the output signal of the unknown system are noisy (since both of them are microphone signals) and a different step size control is required. In this paper, the derivation of a new step size is presented. Since the resulting step size cannot be determined directly, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based estimation of the step size is proposed and its effectiveness is demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602953","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585856/7602877/07602953.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative impulse response estimation during doubletalk with an artificial neural network-based step size control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7602953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Relative impulse response estimation during doubletalk with an artificial neural network-based step size control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16409808","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7602953/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative impulse response estimation during doubletalk with an artificial neural network-based step size control","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051098S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585856","isNumber":"7602877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585856","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7602877","articleId":"7602953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7602954,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Han","affiliation":["Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Han","id":"37085811639"},{"name":"Xiongwei Zhang","affiliation":["Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiongwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291974900"},{"name":"Meng Sun","affiliation":["Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085448883"},{"name":"Wenhua Shi","affiliation":["Flight Instructor Training Base, Air Force Aviation University, Bengbu, China","Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085893570"},{"name":"Xushan Chen","affiliation":["Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xushan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085704312"},{"name":"Yonggang Hu","affiliation":["Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yonggang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085890308"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2007-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7602954","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech enhancement","Noise measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Training","Feature extraction","Masking threshold"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","neural nets","signal denoising","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptual improvement","monaural speech enhancement","deep neural networks","DNN-based speech enhancement method","complex feature extraction","DNN architecture","human auditory system","piecewise gain function","noise reduction","residual noise","TIMIT corpus","signal-to-noise ratio condition","SNR condition","reference speech enhancement method","matched noise condition","unmatched noise condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech enhancement","deep neural networks","piecewise gain function","joint optimization"]}],"abstract":"Monaural speech enhancement is a key yet challenging problem for many important real world applications.

Faces plays an important role in the estimation/prediction of the age and gender of persons, just by looking at their face. Perceiving human faces and modeling the distinctive features of human faces that contribute most towards face recognition are some of the challenges faced by computer vision and psychophysics researchers. In this research, an attempt is made to classify human age and gender using Multiple Hierarchical decision based on Neural Networks. Now a days, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been widely used as a tool for solving many decision modeling problems. In this paper, a feed forward propagation Neural Networks are constructed for human age and gender classification system for gray-scale facial images. Three age groups including Children, Middle-aged adults and Old aged adults and Two gender groups including Male and Female are used in the classification system. The performance of the system is further improved by employing Multiple Hierarchical decision using 3 Sigma Control Limits applied on the output of the Neural Network classifier.

A high power amplifier gets saturated, when the amplitude or power of the input signal is very large. Nonlinearity in power amplifier is due to the combined effect of amplitude distortion, phase distortion and memory effect. By using power amplifier linearization method, efficiency of the power amplifier can be improved without affecting its linearity. In this work an efficient predistorter is implemented for compensating distortions caused by high power amplifiers which shows true output saturation characteristics. Wiener model is used for modeling the power amplifier. The wiener power amplifier model parameter is estimated using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Modified PSO (MPSO). Then the predistorter is designed using the estimated Wiener HPA model parameters. The predistorter is implemented by using Hammerstein model. The combined performance of predistorter and power amplifier was evaluated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","Nonlinear filters","High power amplifiers","Predistortion","Phase distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier linearization method","predistorter","MPSO","modified particle swarm optimization","wireless communication system","amplitude distortion","phase distortion","memory effect","Wiener HPA model parameters","Hammerstein model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hammerstein model","memory high power amplifier","particle swarm optimization","predistorter","Wiener model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603029","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585855/7602971/07603029.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel predistorter based on MPSO for power amplifier linearization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel predistorter based on MPSO for power amplifier linearization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603029/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603029/","accessionNumber":"16409635","conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel predistorter based on MPSO for power amplifier linearization","confLoc":"Pudukkottai, India","sourcePdf":"EC2556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044492S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585855","isNumber":"7602971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585855","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7602971","articleId":"7603029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7603030,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In our approach, depending on the states of RFID and PIR sensor outputs, access is given only to authorized persons, whose RFID tag data matches with that of the program memory of FPGA.

The main basic aim of image compression is greatly to reduce the number of the image pixel elements with the main intension not to affect the original quality of the original image that is to be compressed. It is usually done by removing the redundancy present in the image. Objective of this paper is to compare few promising compression techniques such as DWT coding, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), new hybrid techniques for compression. DWT improves the quality of compressed image. Back-propagation algorithm can be extensively used as a learning algorithm in Artificial Neural Networks. BPNN comes under Feed-Forward Neural Network Architecture. This type of architecture can be used in approximation of all the problems, which is having high precision. Error correction learning rule is particularly used by this Neural Network. This is very efficient algorithm for Image Compression, which works with the architecture of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). There are different types of parameters, which includes Compression ratio (CR), Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), Bits per pixel (BPP) and Mean Square error (MSE). The quality of any compressed image can be assessed using a set of parameters. Then the performance Analysis of different images is carried out (on application of three different algorithms) in this paper. The resulst clearly explais that hybrid Image Compression using hybrid DWT-BP(Discrete Wavelet Transform-Back Propagation) provides better CR and PSNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603060/","accessionNumber":"16409647","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid discrete wavelet transform with neural network back propagation approach for efficient medical image compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid discrete wavelet transform with neural network back propagation approach for efficient medical image compression","confLoc":"Pudukkottai, India","sourcePdf":"EC98304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074133S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585855","isNumber":"7602971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585855","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7602971","articleId":"7603060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7603063,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The key challenge of silicon validation is that it has limited observability and controllability of internal signals. To improve those, a profitable set of signals should be selected. An automated procedure is proposed to select those signals which are used to facilitate early malfunctions of the design. Given the input vector set to the design an error transmission matrix is generated. From that, both relatively independent and dependent flip-flops are identified for grouping the signals through Mixed-Integer Linear programming. This method precisely identifies the paths which improves observability and can speed up the process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous signal selection for silicon debug through Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","doi":"10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603063","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585855/7602971/07603063.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous signal selection for silicon debug through Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603063/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409672","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous signal selection for silicon debug through Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","confLoc":"Pudukkottai, India","sourcePdf":"EC85261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039258S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585855","isNumber":"7602971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585855","xplore-issue":"7602971","articleId":"7603063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603064,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper describes Sensorless Adaptive optics (SLAO) technique which replaces the high cost wavefront sensor and corrects aberrated optical wavefront by comparing a test wavefront to a perfect, reference wavefront, and then modifying the test wavefront in order to reach the reference wavefront. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based reconstruction technique is proposed. The neural network is designed to use the information of tilt in the wave-front acquired by the science camera by extracting the parameters as inputs and estimate the turbulence in terms of Zernike coefficients. Multi-Layer feed forward Neural Network is used to train the inputs and to find actuator control voltages which are applied to DM. In this paper we present a practical implementation of Adaptive Optics system at 850 nm based on a wave-front sensorless architecture. Proposed experimental set-up reduces the complexity and the cost of the conventional adaptive optics system. SLAO provides fast and effective wave-front correction. When compared with the conventional AO systems, the sensorless technique offers the advantage of not requiring the high cost wavefront sensor.","doi":"10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603064","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585855/7602971/07603064.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602971","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of low-order atmospheric turbulent effects using sensorless adaptive optics in terrestrial free space optical communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of low-order atmospheric turbulent effects using sensorless adaptive optics in terrestrial free space optical communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603064/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409725","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603064/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of low-order atmospheric turbulent effects using sensorless adaptive optics in terrestrial free space optical communication","confLoc":"Pudukkottai, India","sourcePdf":"EC0408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076441S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585855","isNumber":"7602971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585855","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7602971","articleId":"7603064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603067,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Voltage quality problem exists in terms of sags and swells whose detection is a major issue in power system network. Redundancy identification method (conventional method) has low accuracy due to the co-relativity between voltage sag and sag disturbances and hence, detection of existence of sag, identifying its causes and its mitigation is a major problem in power network. Most of the voltage quality problems in distribution networks occur due to non identification of type of fault or sag in a particular phase and is a major challenge. Several algorithms are existing for identification of sag and swell in literature. This work is mainly focuses on simple sag identification in power system network using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). The proposed FFT is modeled to detect the fault, identify the type and depth of the fault. A MATLAB/SIMULINK model is developed for testing the various fault conditions. Simulation results of the proposed method shows that the comprehensive feature indices takes less time with more accuracy for identification of sources of disturbance for voltage sag under different types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault conditions than the conventional identification features indices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585855/7602971/07603081.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","doi":"10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel multiple fault identification with fast fourier transform analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Fault diagnosis","Circuit faults","MATLAB","Fast Fourier transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","power distribution faults","power distribution reliability","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-fault identification","fast Fourier transform analysis","voltage quality effect","power quality problem","power system network","customer load operation","distribution systems","voltage swells","redundancy identification method","voltage sag disturbance","voltage sag detection","voltage sag identification","FFT","fault detection","fault depth identification","fault type identification","Matlab-Simulink model","symmetrical fault condition","unsymmetrical fault condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)","Sag Identification","Voltage sag","symmetrical and un-symmetrical fault"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel multiple fault identification with fast fourier transform analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603081/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409681","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel multiple fault identification with fast fourier transform analysis","confLoc":"Pudukkottai, India","sourcePdf":"EE41162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085517S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585855","isNumber":"7602971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585855","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7602971","articleId":"7603081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603084,"authors":[{"name":"Pothula Jagadeesh","affiliation":["Department of EEE, SRKR Engineering College, Bhimavaram, India"],"firstName":"Pothula","lastName":"Jagadeesh","id":"37085875621"},{"name":"M.

The PSS is usually designed based on classical control approaches but this conventional PSS (CPSS) has some problems. To overcome the drawbacks of CPSS, numerous techniques have been proposed in literatures. In this paper a PID type PSS is considered for damping electric power system oscillations.

The parameters of the Solar PV model depend on the input parameters namely temperature and irradiance. The parameter estimation of Solar Photovoltaic module is one of the challenging research areas. In this work, the parameter estimation of the PV cell is formulated as an optimization problem and Real Coded Genetic Algorithm is applied to seek the optimal parameter of the solar cell model. The mathematical model of the solar PV cell is expressed explicitly using Lambert function. The estimated PV cell parameters are up scaled to PV module based on the PV module internal cell connection. In the proposed algorithm, the variable of the optimization problem are directly represented as floating point to overcome the drawbacks of representing variables as binary string in the conventional genetic algorithm. Under varying temperature and irradiance conditions, the parameters are estimated and the result is also presented in this paper. The simulation results are compared with binary coded genetic algorithms based parameter estimation in terms of accuracy and computational time in a PC with Core 2 Duo processor with 3 GB RAM.","doi":"10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603085","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585855/7602971/07603085.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real coded genetic algorithm for optimal parameter estimation of solar photovoltaic model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Mathematical model","Parameter estimation","Sociology","Photovoltaic cells","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","parameter estimation","photovoltaic power systems","solar cells","solar power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real coded genetic algorithm","optimal parameter estimation","solar photovoltaic model","PV cell","fault diagnosis","optimization problem","solar cell model","mathematical model","PV module internal cell connection","varying temperature conditions","irradiance conditions","computational time","PC","Core 2 Duo processor","RAM","binary string"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lambert Function","Parameter Estimation","Photovoltaic Cell Model","Real Coded Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Real coded genetic algorithm for optimal parameter estimation of solar photovoltaic model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603085/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409730","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real coded genetic algorithm for optimal parameter estimation of solar photovoltaic model","confLoc":"Pudukkottai, India","sourcePdf":"EE0514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070142S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585855","isNumber":"7602971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585855","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7602971","articleId":"7603085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7603086,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Distributed Generation resources have a lot of concentration in recent times due to its optimistic impact on power system. Studies show that nonoptimal locations and non-optimal sizes of DG units may lead to losses increase, together with bad effect on voltage profile and harmonics. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has became one of the most popular optimization methods in the domain of Swarm Intelligence. Many PSO algorithms have been proposed for distributed generations (DGs) deployed into grids for power delivery and reliability to consumers. The installation of DG at optimum location boosts the performance of distribution system as well as presents a cost effective solution thus giving a new dimension to distribution system planning. This made DG planning problem solution to be of two steps namely, finding the optimal placement bus in the distribution system as well as optimal sizing of the DG. This paper reviews some of the PSO and hybrids of PSO Algorithms formulated for DG placement being one of the meta-heuristic optimization methods that fits stochastic optimization problems. The review has shown that PSO Algorithms are very efficient in handling the DG placement and sizing problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETETS.2016.7603088","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585855/7602971/07603088.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7602971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Review on optimal distributed generation placement using particle swarm optimization algorithms","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409649","htmlLink":"/document/7603088/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review on optimal distributed generation placement using particle swarm optimization algorithms","confLoc":"Pudukkottai, India","sourcePdf":"EE1781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045542S","chronDate":"24-26 Feb. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585855","isNumber":"7602971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585855","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7602971","articleId":"7603088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603142,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537594100"},{"name":"Weizhe Jing","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Weizhe","lastName":"Jing","id":"37085889323"},{"name":"Lixiong Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lixiong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085413932"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603142","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Classification algorithms","Neurons","Algorithm design and analysis","Training","Instruction sets","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","backpropagation","data handling","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascading model based back propagation neural network","CBPNN","pattern classification","artificial neural network","function approximation","data separation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Back propagation neural network","cascading","multi-threading"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603142","abstract":"Artificial Neural Network has been widely used in types of tasks which are related to classification, for example image annotation, pattern recognition, trend prediction and so on. There are a number of neural network algorithm theories based on various concepts, however, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) has become the most famous one due to its remarkable function approximation ability. BPNN employs feed forward and back propagation to tune the parameters in neurons, and uses only feed forward to execute the classification. Based on gradient descent mechanism, BPNN can effectively find the mapping relationships between input and output. However, BPNN has met one critical issue. Due to large number of sum and sigmoid operations, BPNN has low efficiency in dealing with large number of instances. To speed up the processing, researchers employed data separation. However, simple data separation in training phase results in classification accuracy loss. Therefore, this paper presents a cascading model based BPNN (CBPNN) which aims at enhancing the classification accuracy of BPNN. The paper further employs multi-threading technique to speed up CBPNN. The experimental results indicate that CBPNN can improve the classification precision whilst maintains satisfied efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603142","startPage":"7","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603142.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascading model based back propagation neural network in enabling precise classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603142/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cascading model based back propagation neural network in enabling precise classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603142/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16408966","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascading model based back propagation neural network in enabling precise classification","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074028S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603143,"authors":[{"name":"Qiquan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Safety Engineering, China Institute of Industrial Relations, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086404223"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603143","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603143","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public transportation","Indexes","Emergency services","Fires","Artificial neural networks","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accidents","emergency management","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emergency evacuation capability assessment","subway operation","artificial neural network","subway accident","subway security issues","Beijing metro lines","warning index system","overall emergency evacuation ability","traffic lines","subway lines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Subway Operation","Emergency Evacuation Capability","Artificial Neural Network","Evacuation Exit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603143","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603143.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emergency evacuation capability assessment of subway operation based on Artificial Neural Network","abstract":"Subway has become one of main means of transportation all over the world.

However, fruit recognition is still a problem for the stacked fruits on weighing scale because of complexity and overlap. In this paper, a fruit recognition algorithm based on convolution neural network(CNN) is proposed. At first the image regions are extracted using selective search algorithm, then the regions have been selected by means of an entropy of fruit images, and finally these regions are regarded as input of CNN neural network for training and recognition. The final decision is made based on a fusion of all region classifications using voting mechanism. In order to achieve the actual application in supermarket, we have considered the variety of fruit, stack of fruits, the changes of fruit number and position, and have made a multifarious training set of fruits. After the network has been trained with an optimal training set, it has obtained a remarkable recognition rates for the fruits stacked on a weighing scale.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603144/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16397890","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603144/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fruit recognition based on convolution neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fruit recognition based on convolution neural network","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048355S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7603153,"authors":[{"name":"Sreenivas Sremath Tirumala","affiliation":["Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Sreenivas Sremath","lastName":"Tirumala","id":"37085362946"},{"name":"S Ali","affiliation":["UNITEC Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Ali","id":"37085547814"},{"name":"C Phani Ramesh","affiliation":["Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, India"],"firstName":"C Phani","lastName":"Ramesh","id":"37085899894"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603153","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":913},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Machine learning","Neural networks","Computer architecture","Network topology","Topology","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","neural nets","pattern classification","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural networks","natural language processing","NLP","image processing","character recognition","machine learning","ML","evolutionary computation","EC","evolutionary algorithms","MNIST data set","classification accuracy","time training reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolving Neural Networks","Deep Neural Networks","Multi-population evolution","Co-evolution"]}],"abstract":"The success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for various applications like language processing (NLP), image processing, character recognition inspired to use machine learning (ML) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques for improving learning process. Using evolutionary algorithms to improve the efficiency of deep learning attained some success. However, these techniques are unable to reduce the learning time which is the key concern for deep learning. The main problem with DNN is that, it uses a random topology to start with (similar to artificial neural networks). If the topology is not suitable, training procedure will restart with a new topology and this process continues till expected results are obtained. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a new prospect for evolving optimized deep neural networks which can provide a warm start to the training process compared to heuristic random initial architecture. We discuss the theoretical approach towards possibility of optimizing the learning process inspired from the existing un-conventional approaches. The training process of DNN with EC approach is faster than regular approach by a considerable difference of over 6 hours for MNIST data set. Further, we observed a considerable improvement in the classification accuracies. Our approaches resulted in an improved classification accuracy of 2% and 4.4%for MNIST data set and 1.2% and 1.4% for IRIS data set compared to heuristic random weights approach. Our initial experimental results prove that evolutionary approaches provides a warm start to the deep learning, thus, reducing the training time.","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603153.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving deep neural networks: A new prospect","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Evolving deep neural networks: A new prospect","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408960","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603153/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving deep neural networks: A new prospect","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123692S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603157,"authors":[{"name":"Yingbiao Ling","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, P.R.

This approach applies the divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the problem into subcomponents which can be optimized separately. Nevertheless, the decomposition strategy has important influence on solution quality. In theory, the interdependency between subcomponents should be kept minimum as the subcomponents coadaptation is needed to solve large scale optimization problems. Some state of the art decomposition strategies like differential grouping gain high grouping accuracy on a suite of benchmark functions. In this paper, we use graph theory to model the decomposition problem and propose graph-based differential grouping decomposition strategy to improve the decomposition accuracy of differential grouping. Empirical studies show that our decomposition method get perfect performance on all benchmark functions. Significantly, the solution quality on large scale problems are better than several outstanding decomposition strategies when the graph-based differential grouping is embedded with cooperative co-evolution framework.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603157","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","startPage":"95","endPage":"102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative co-evolution with graph-based differential grouping for large scale global optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative co-evolution with graph-based differential grouping for large scale global optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603157/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409109","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603157/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative co-evolution with graph-based differential grouping for large scale global optimization","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078563S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603158,"authors":[{"name":"Lizhuang Tan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Lizhuang","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085906771"},{"name":"Yanyan Tan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085904653"},{"name":"Guoxiao Yun","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Guoxiao","lastName":"Yun","id":"37085902185"},{"name":"Yanna Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yanna","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085901250"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603158","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603158","abstract":"Genetic Algorithm (GA) is an effective method for solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs), nevertheless, the Classical Genetic Algorithm (CGA) performs poor effect for large-scale traveling salesman problems. For conquering the problem, this paper presents two improved genetic algorithms based on clustering to find the best results of TSPs. The main process is clustering, intra-group evolution operation and inter-group connection. Clustering includes two methods to divide the large scale TSP into several sub-problems. One is k-means, and the other is affinity propagation (AP). Each sub-problem corresponds to a group. Then we use GA to find the shortest path length for each sub-problem. At last, we design an effective connection method to combine all those groups into one which is the result of the problem. we trial run a set of experiments on benchmark instances for testing the performance of the proposed genetic algorithm based on k-means clustering (KGA) and genetic algorithm based on affinity propagation clustering (APGA). Experimental results demonstrate their effective and efficient performances. Comparing results with other clustering genetic algorithms show that KGA and APGA are competitive and efficient.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Clustering

Through the simulation of eight standard test functions we can see that the improved artificial glowworm swarm optimization algorithm has much higher convergence speed, computing precision and the success rate of convergence in comparison with the other algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16408944","htmlLink":"/document/7603175/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Chaotic glowworm swarm optimization algorithm based on Gauss mutation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic glowworm swarm optimization algorithm based on Gauss mutation","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062933S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":7603176,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information engineering, Guangdong Technical College of Water Resources and Electric Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37675229100"},{"name":"Wenfei Luo","affiliation":["School of Geographical Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wenfei","lastName":"Luo","id":"37592213600"},{"name":"Lianru Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lianru","lastName":"Gao","id":"37400377200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603176","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Approximation algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Bayes methods","Computational modeling","Optimization","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","nonlinear spectral unmixing","generalized bilinear model","nonlinear mixing models","hyperspectral remote sensing analysis","hessian matrix","probability distributions","nonlinear unmixing problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","hyperspectral remote sensing","nonlinear unmixing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603176","abstract":"Spectral unmixing is a key procedure of hyperspectral remote sensing analysis. Recently, nonlinear unmixing becomes a hotspot in this research field. However, due to the complexity of the nonlinear mixing models (nonLMM), it is trivial to develop an algorithm for nonlinear unmixing. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a classical algorithm of natural computation, which presents a great potential of nonlinear unmixing. Specially, it employs only a fitness value directly determined by the nonLMM, and does not need any information concerning about the gradient, hessian matrix, or probability distributions. Thus, it can be easily applied to characterize complex nonLMMs. In this paper, we develop a biswarm (double swarm) PSO algorithm for nonlinear unmixing, with a case study of generalized bilinear model (GBM). The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other traditional algorithms for hyperspectral images. As a result, we can conclude that the PSO algorithm is an excellent method for addressing nonlinear unmixing problem.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603176","startPage":"211","endPage":"217","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603176.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization for nonlinear spectral unmixing: A case study of generalized bilinear model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603176/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization for nonlinear spectral unmixing: A case study of generalized bilinear model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603176/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16409280","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization for nonlinear spectral unmixing: A case study of generalized bilinear model","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062167S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7603177,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Hu","affiliation":["Southwest Nationalities Research Academy, Southwest University for Nationalities, Chendu, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085904255"},{"name":"Feng Yin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Southwest University for Nationalities, Chendu, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085906916"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603177","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Standards","Topology","Artificial intelligence","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","swarm intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","intelligence technology","premature convergence","Jarque-Bera test","null hypothesis","data samples","PSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization (PSO)","swarm intelligence","artificial intelligence","evolutionary computation","position updating"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603177","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has become a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence technology, wherein the two issues including theoretical analysis and premature convergence have attracted lots of attention.

To handle the above problems, a unified and simplified formula for position updating in the existing PSOs has been proposed in one reference, but the similarity between those original position updating formulas and this unified and simplified formula is still not completely clarified. In this paper, we took the similarity as a Jarque-Bera test of a null hypothesis, wherein a large amount of data samples were derived from ten classical or novel PSOs.

These dynamic problems need the optimization algorithm to constantly find the time-varying optimal solutions. This paper proposes a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition and adaptive diversity introduction (denoted by dMOEAD-DI). Specifically, the dMOEAD-DI decomposes a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem into several dynamic single objective optimization subproblems and solves them at the same time. Also, an adaptive diversity introduction (ADI) method is adopted to respond to the environment change, and the scale of diversity introduction can be automatically calculated by the real degree of dynamic change, so as to enable the population adapt to the new environment quickly. The effectiveness of the dMOEAD-DI algorithm is validated against other two well-known algorithms. Simulation results on four benchmark problems demonstrate that the dMOEAD-DI has better convergence and distribution of non-dominated solutions obtained around the changing Pareto optimal front.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603180/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16409212","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603180/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A dynamic evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm based on decomposition and adaptive diversity introduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm based on decomposition and adaptive diversity introduction","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104342S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603186,"authors":[{"name":"Kaifeng Yang","affiliation":["Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Kaifeng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085674791"},{"name":"Longmei Li","affiliation":["Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Longmei","lastName":"Li","id":"37085669221"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Deutz","affiliation":["Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Deutz","id":"38180525100"},{"name":"Thomas Back","affiliation":["Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Back","id":"37344469700"},{"name":"Michael Emmerich","affiliation":["Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Emmerich","id":"37368146600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603186","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Linear programming","Gaussian distribution","Computer science","Electronic mail","Probability density function","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preference-based multiobjective optimization","truncated expected hypervolume improvement","Pareto front","multiobjective efficient global optimization","EGO","Gaussian processes","infill criterion","TEHVI","standard bi-objective problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Truncated Expected Hypervolume Improvement","Expected Hypervolume Improvement","Preferred Region","Surrogated-assisted Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603186","abstract":"The ultimate goal of multi-objective optimization is to provide potential solutions to a decision maker. Usually, what they are concerned with is a Pareto front in an interesting/preferred region, instead of the whole Pareto front. In this paper, a method for effectively approximating a preferred Pareto front, based on multiobjective efficient global optimization (EGO), is introduced. EGO uses Gaussian processes (or Kriging) to build a model of the objective function. Our variant of EGO uses truncated expected hypervolume improvement (TEHVI) as an infill criterion, which takes predictive mean, variance and preference region in the objective space into consideration. Compared to expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI), the probability density function in TEHVI follows a truncated normal distribution. This paper proposes a TEHVI method that makes it possible to set a region of interest on the Pareto front and focus search effectively on this preferred region. An expression for the exact and efficient computation of the TEHVI for truncation over a two dimensional range is derived, and benchmark results on standard bi-objective problems for small budget of evaluations are computed, confirming the effectiveness of the new approach.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603186","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603186.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"281","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural

The data gravitation based classification (DGC) model, a newly developed physical-inspired supervised learning model, has been proven effective for standard supervised learning tasks. However, DGC is not able to get high performances for imbalanced data sets, like most other standard learning algorithms do. Thus, to address the problem, an under-sampling technique, together with an ensemble technique, has been designed to adapt the standard DGC model for imbalanced learning tasks. The new adapted DGC model is called UI-DGC. 22 low imbalanced and 22 high imbalanced data sets are selected for the experimental study. UI-DGC is compared with standard and imbalanced learning algorithms.

Through facial emotions the interaction human-machine can get more natural. In order to improve the accuracy we argue that feature selection is an important issue in facial emotion classification. We demonstrate that the error rate can be significantly reduced by removing some features that encode unimportant information from the image representation of faces. In this paper we propose genetic algorithm for feature selection. First the feature vector is extracted by using pyramid histogram of oriented gradient (PHOG) and then genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select a subset of features from the low-dimensional representation by removing certain values that seem to encode unimportant information about facial emotion. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier is used to perform the classification. The results show that using GA as feature selector has significantly increased the accuracy. Compared to different approaches based on the well known dimensionality reduction technique namely principal component analysis (PCA) our approach leads to higher accuracy rate.

In order to perform the task of choosing unlabeled examples in SB, various strategies have been proposed in the literature. Meanwhile, cuckoo search (CS) is a novel meta-heuristic algorithm, whose obtained solutions are better than solutions obtained by efficient particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). Recently, rather than using the original CS algorithm, some kinds of modifications have been proposed to improve its searching performance. This paper presents an empirical comparison, using modified CS algorithms to select useful unlabeled examples for SB learning. In particular, several modification strategies were considered and compared empirically, including a CS modified by using the probability estimate in initialization (CS-pE); a modification for unconstrained optimization problems by changing the step-size; a modified CS using Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations in initialization; and modified CSs using adaptive parameters. The experimental results show that the CS-pE strategy works better than the other modifications in synthetic and real-life benchmark data in terms of classification accuracy. In addition, the results show that when a set of the fine tuned parameters is provided and the searching process is appropriately initialized, the strategy achieves further improvement in the accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603230","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603230.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"541","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Choosing unlabeled examples for SemiBoost using modified cuckoo search algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Choosing unlabeled examples for SemiBoost using modified cuckoo search algorithms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603230/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409007","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603230/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choosing unlabeled examples for SemiBoost using modified cuckoo search algorithms","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084227S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603232,"authors":[{"name":"YuShe Cao","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, ChangSha, China"],"firstName":"YuShe","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085898914"},{"name":"Xin Niu","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, ChangSha, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Niu","id":"37085383040"},{"name":"Yong Dou","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, ChangSha, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Dou","id":"37085384440"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603232","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1022},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Aircraft","Remote sensing","Object detection","Feature extraction","Image edge detection","Airports"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["region-based convolutional neural networks","very high resolution remote sensing images","bag-of-visual-words","complex scenes","final detection results","box-fusion","BOVW method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["aircraft detection","deep learning","convolutional neural network","feature learning"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the automatic object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images has become the key point in the application of remote sensing technology.

This paper we first try to use the current hot deep learning technology: Region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), to detect aircrafts under the complex environments in high-resolution remote sensing images. This method has been proved to be very efficiency when using in object detection in natural images. Here, we tried to introduce this method into the field of the remote sensing. During our experiments, we also compared the impact of different proposal generate methods on the final detection results. And we also proposed some practical tips to accelerate the detection speed. After detection, we proposed to use a novel algorithm which we called box-fusion, to eliminate the redundant and repetitive boxes that covering the same object. As experiments and results shows, the R-CNN method is much more effective and robust than the traditional BOVW method when dealing with aircrafts detection under complex scenes in high-resolution remote sensing images.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603232","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603232.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region-based convolutional neural networks for object detection in very high resolution remote sensing images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603232/","displayDocTitle":"Region-based convolutional neural networks for object detection in very high resolution remote sensing images","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603232/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409159","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region-based convolutional neural networks for object detection in very high resolution remote sensing images","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043722S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7603233,"authors":[{"name":"Rongqiang Qian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, P.R.

The main advantage of our model is that it can take advantages of wavelet, probability neural network and Shannon entropy to obtain good performance on the condition that quality of speech is low. In our model, the speech is decomposed into 8 different subbands by discrete wavelet transform, and then 8 Shannon entropies are extracted from those subbands to form the feature vector. Finally, the extracted feature vector is used as inputs to a feed-ward neural network named probabilistic neural network(PNN). The TIMIT speech database is used to evaluate the proposed model. Compared with MFCC+GMM and ECD+GMM. The experimental results show that The proposed model obtained the best performance for low quality speech. Therefore, our new speaker identification model is suitable for speaker identification.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603235","startPage":"566","endPage":"571","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th

Recently, deep learning models demonstrated prominent representation capacity, and achieved outstanding performance in traffic sign recognition. In this paper, we propose a traffic sign recognition system by applying convolutional neural network (CNN). In comparison with previous methods which usually use CNN as feature extractor and multi-layer perception (MLP) as classifier, we proposed max pooling positions (MPPs) as an effective discriminative feature to predict category labels. Through extensive experiments, MPPs demonstrates the ideal characteristics of small inter-class variance and large intra-class variance.

Specifically, given an image, skin-like regions are extracted by Gaussian Mixture Model, which are passed to a deep convolutional neural networks model, namely R*CNN, to generate action labels. The skin-like regions are able to provide abundant semantic information with sufficient discriminative capability. Also, R*CNN is able to select the most informative regions from candidates to facilitate the final action recognition. We tested the proposed methods on Southeast University Driving-posture Dataset and achieve mean Average Precision(mAP) of 97.76% on the dataset which prove the proposed method is effective in drivers's action recognition.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603248","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603248.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driver behavior recognition based on deep convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Driver behavior recognition based on deep convolutional neural networks","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603248/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409106","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver behavior recognition based on deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086246S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-17"},{"_id":7603249,"authors":[{"name":"Fanzi Zeng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Embedded and Network Computing of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Fanzi","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37292360100"},{"name":"Chen Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Embedded and Network Computing of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085894317"},{"name":"Jisheng Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Embedded and Network Computing of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jisheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085374836"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603249","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"abstract":"In this paper, we presented a fairness-aware scheduling scheme in OFDM-based cognitive radio networks.

By analyzing and being compared with several kinds of commonly used Short-range wireless communication, we establish a UWB (Ultra Wide Band) communication system model and the transmission error rate expression by using STBC (Space-Time Block Coding) scheme. Also a solution to decrease BER (Bit Error Rate) effectively by using MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology is put forward. The simulation results show that: MIMO-UWB short-range wireless communication system can reduce the transmission error rate and enhance the data transmission performance of communication system even in very low SNR(signal to noise ratio) condition. Compared with other means of communication, multiple antenna can not only maintain a high rate of high quality wireless communication function in high electromagnetic interference environment, but also work normally with very low power. So MIMO-UWB short-range wireless system can better adapt to the requirement of future Internet of Things and short-range large amount of information wireless communication. It has very important value of research and application.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603251","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","startPage":"652","endPage":"656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on a high noise immunity transmission system and its performance in short-range wireless communication based on the MIMO-UWB technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research on a high noise immunity transmission system and its performance in short-range wireless communication based on the MIMO-UWB technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603251/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408984","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on a high noise immunity transmission system and its performance in short-range wireless communication based on the MIMO-UWB technology","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041074S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603252,"authors":[{"name":"Fanzi Zeng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Embedded and Network Computing of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Fanzi","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37292360100"},{"name":"Hanshan Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Embedded and Network Computing of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hanshan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085888215"},{"name":"Jisheng Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Embedded and Network Computing of Hunan Province, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jisheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085374836"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603252","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Throughput","Wireless sensor networks","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","learning (artificial intelligence)","multi-agent systems","power engineering computing","telecommunication channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential channel selection","decentralized cognitive radio sensor network","modified Q-Learning algorithm","wireless sensor network","cognitive technology","CRSN","decentralized CRSN","multiagent best-response Q-learning algorithm","timesharing-tracking framework","multiagent simultaneous learning","optimal channel assignment","multiagent independent Q-learning","win-or-learn-fast policy hill climbing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603252","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603252","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","abstract":"Cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) is a novel wireless sensor network, which can effectively alleviate the scarcity of spectrum resource by equipping the cognitive technology. Usually, CRSN deploys numerous sensor nodes around the monitoring area. But the energy and storage of those nodes are both limited. Compared with the centralized CRSN, we focus more on a decentralized situation without the control center or cluster in this paper, especially on a circumstance with few information exchanges among sensor nodes. In the case of that, our goal is to help each sensor node to find an optimal strategy of channel selection in the decentralized CRSN quickly, and then, we apply a Multi-Agent Best-Response Q-Learning algorithm based on Timesharing-Tracking Framework to sequential channel selection for the first time. The algorithm not only has a low storage cost, but also can overcome the poor convergence of strategy caused by Multi-Agent simultaneous learning. For comparison, the optimal channel assignment in centralized network, the Multi-Agent Independent Q-Learning and the Win-or-Learn-Fast Policy Hill Climbing these three algorithms are taken into account, and experimental data validates that our proposed algorithm is feasible in decentralized network.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","startPage":"657","endPage":"662","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603252.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential channel selection for decentralized cognitive radio sensor network based on modified Q-Learning algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603252/","displayDocTitle":"Sequential channel selection for decentralized cognitive radio sensor network based on modified Q-Learning algorithm","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408949","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential channel selection for decentralized cognitive radio sensor network based on modified Q-Learning algorithm","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071281S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7603254,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhang Xia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yizhang","lastName":"Xia","id":"37085723418"},{"name":"Jing Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085886325"},{"name":"Bailing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bailing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598208800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603254","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":649},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Feature extraction","Training","Convolution","Visualization","Support vector machines","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","intelligent transportation systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle logo recognition","multitask learning","intelligent transportation system","ITS","vehicle logo attribute prediction","convolutional neural network","convergence","adaptive weight training","Xiamen University Vehicle logo recognition dataset","visual attributes","no-visual attributes","multitask CNN model","logo classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicle Logo Recognition (VLR)","Con-volutional Neural Networks(CNNs)","Multi-Task Learning(MTL)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603254.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Logo Recognition and attributes prediction by multi-task learning with CNN","abstract":"Vehicle Logo Recognition(VLR) has been an important study field in intelligent Transportation system (ITS).

However, existing algorithms which are ranging from the optimization-based to model-based strategies still need to be strengthened further in terms of their robustness and accuracy. In this paper, a kind of multi-headed slime molds, Physarum, is used for optimizing genetic algorithm (GA), due to its intelligence of generating foraging networks based on bioresearches. Thus, a Physarum-based Network Model (PNM) is proposed based on the Physarum-based Model, which shows an ability of recognizing inter-community edges. Combining PNM with a genetic algorithm, a novel genetic algorithm, called PNGACD, is putting forward to enhance the GA's efficiency, in which a priori edge recognition of PNM is integrated into the phase of initialization. Moreover, experiments in six real-world networks are used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that there is a remarkable improvement in term of the robustness and accuracy, which demonstrates that PNGACD has a better performance, compared with the existing algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603255.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"679","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bio-inspired genetic algorithm for community mining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Conductivity","Biological system modeling","Robustness","Biological cells","Mathematical model","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex networks","genetic algorithms","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired genetic algorithm","community mining","community structure","multiheaded slime molds","foraging networks","bioresearches","Physarum-based network model","PNM","intercommunity edges recognition","PNGACD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex networks","community structure","genetic algorithm","Physarum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A bio-inspired genetic algorithm for community mining","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603255/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409213","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bio-inspired genetic algorithm for community mining","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069639S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603258,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohonag Zhng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, PR China"],"firstName":"Xiaohonag","lastName":"Zhng","id":"37085891935"},{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, PR China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292024700"},{"name":"Changsheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, PR China"],"firstName":"Changsheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085508205"},{"name":"Anxiang Ma","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, PR China"],"firstName":"Anxiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37529156200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603258","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603258","abstract":"Communities detection algorithm based on GA is attracting common interest.

This study aims to evaluate the potential application of ANN models for predicting learning performances, in comparison with multivariate logistic regression models. The predictor variables included demographics, high-school backgrounds, first-year grade-point averages, and composite scores of examinations during the course. Medical student learning performances were represented by their normalized T-scores of the total examination score. Three ANN models, including a support vector machine, were used to predict performance. A comparison between the models, based upon areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve values, showed no significant differences between the ANNs and logistic regression models (p > 0.05 for all pairs in the comparison). This work thus reveals the promising potential for the application of ANNs in the prediction of learning performances, in the field of medical education.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603268","startPage":"745","endPage":"751","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603268.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of artificial neural networks for prediction of learning performances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Support vector machines","Biomedical imaging","Artificial neural networks","Analytical models","Training","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical education","educational administrative data processing","educational courses","neural nets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","medical student learning performance prediction","medical education","ANN models","demographics","high-school backgrounds","first-year grade-point averages","composite scores","normalized T-scores","total examination score","support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RBF","MLP","PNN","SVM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Application of artificial neural networks for prediction of learning performances","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603268/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409196","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of artificial neural networks for prediction of learning performances","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070509S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7603269,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Management, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085899042"},{"name":"Gang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Management, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290342600"},{"name":"Xingren Yao","affiliation":["School of Information Management, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xingren","lastName":"Yao","id":"37085905676"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603269","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Neurons","Training","Predictive models","Wind","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["back-propagation neural network","bus traffic prediction","bus lines","BP neural network","time factor","meteorological factor","Guangzhou","information processing capacity","output neuron characteristics","input neuron characteristics","neural network structure","bus traffic forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP neural network","prediction of bus traffic","parameters adjustment","data preprocessing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603269","abstract":"In order to devise bus lines and make daily scheduling more precisely, this paper uses Back-Propagation(BP) neural network to predict bus traffic.

BP neural network's information processing capacity is determined by the input and output neurons' characteristics, the network structure, the connection weights. The complexity of the neural network structure affects the performance of the neural network. The more complex the network structure is, the better fitted the model will be, meanwhile, it is easy to be over-fitting to the training data and its generalization performs inefficiently. If the network structure is too simple, it can't learn training data very well, and the network can't be converged well and the accuracy of data fitting can't be guaranteed. This paper conducts several experiments to determine the network structure and parameters which are suitable for prediction of bus traffic. Trough Ten-fold cross-validation experiments, the model is demonstrated being able to apply to bus traffic forecast.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603269","startPage":"752","endPage":"756","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603269.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying back-propagation neural network to predict bus traffic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603269/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Applying back-propagation neural network to predict bus traffic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603269/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16408938","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying back-propagation neural network to predict bus traffic","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040368S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7603279,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofan Liu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085907369"},{"name":"Xinge Liu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xinge","lastName":"Liu","id":"37880545200"},{"name":"Meilan Tang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Meilan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37876725600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603279","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Control theory","Numerical stability","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delayed neural networks","NN","modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii function","LKF","delay-dependent exponential stability","linear matrix inequality","LMI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stability","Neural networks","Delay","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","Linear matrix inequality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603279","abstract":"This paper considers exponential stability of delayed neural networks(NNs).

Then, wavelet with six-layer decomposition was implemented based on Daubechies 5 wavelet basis. Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was used for analyzing the frequency spectrum of detail signals. Particularly, six features include the peak frequency of detail signal at level 3, the peak frequency of detail signal at level 4, the Lyapunov index, correlation dimension, Kolmogorov entropy, and box dimension of were extracted for diagnosis purposes based on HHT spectrum and chaos. Moreover, the features space of 20 subjects was used to build the probabilistic neural network (PNN).

evaluating quality of experience on large-scale internet video service","abstract":"Internet video is currently one of the most popular Internet services, accounting for more than 50% of the overall Internet traffic. Various access patterns of users worldwide contribute to increasing complex scenarios of Internet video. Under the circumstances, there emerges a valuable yet challenging topic that industry and academia keep focusing on: how to evaluate quality of experience (QoE) of Internet video in the wild? In this paper, we propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to evaluate QoE based on massive dataset extracted from a large-scale Internet video service provider. With the methods of feature engineering and fuzzy theory, we exploit user's situational features and session's quality features. Then we conceive an appropriate QoE evaluating model called bagging-based Bayesian factorization machine to correlate the aforementioned features with user's QoE. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach is adaptive for QoE evaluation on Internet video both in efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our approach achieves higher degree of accuracy compared with baseline methods, including what associated works present.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603395/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409256","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive data-driven approach to evaluating quality of experience on large-scale internet video service","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive data-driven approach to evaluating quality of experience on large-scale internet video service","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a1479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085885S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603396,"authors":[{"name":"Yuexiang Shi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Yuexiang","lastName":"Shi","id":"37673392300"},{"name":"Xiaoxue Ren","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxue","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085893058"},{"name":"Saizhou Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Saizhou","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085897620"},{"name":"Ping Gong","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Gong","id":"37085894743"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603396","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Training","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Databases","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized kernel fisher discriminant framework","feature extraction","face recognition","GKFD analysis","improved KFD method","double discriminant subspace","DSDA subspace","ORL face database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature extraction","Face recognition","Kernel-based method","Principal component analysis (PCA)","Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an improved Kernel Fisher Discriminant (KFD) method is used in face recognition.

Before encrypted speech is uploaded, perceptual hashing sequences must be embedded as a digital watermark. In the process of generating perceptual hashing, multifractal characteristic of speech that has good distinctiveness and robustness is introduced, and the technology of piecewise aggregate approximation is used for compressing data size. The retrieval process does not need decryption but requires the generation of perceptual hashing sequence of query speech segment. Each perceptual hashing set in system hash table should then be matched successively. Experimental results indicate that the perceptual hashing generated from multifractal characteristics shows better distinctiveness and robustness than those derived from time and frequency domain features in existing methods. Furthermore, because of employing the technology of piecewise aggregate approximation, the generated perceptual hashing has small amounts of data, which leads to the greatly improvement of retrieval speed. And finally, the proposed retrieval algorithm achieves high recall and precision ratios in terms of the variety of content holding operation.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603458","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603458.pdf","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A retrieval algorithm for encrypted speech based on perceptual hashing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603458/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16409084","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603458/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A retrieval algorithm for encrypted speech based on perceptual hashing","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a1840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103577S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7603470,"authors":[{"name":"Han Qi","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085578075"},{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272626400"},{"name":"Erning Zhou","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Erning","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085573932"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603470","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel multi-target direction finding approach is proposed for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar exploiting nested array. In our MIMO radar model, the transmit antennas are widely spaced to enable transmit diversity, while the receiver of the MIMO radar is configured with a 2-level nested array to enable direction finding. The nested array is an emerging non-uniform linear array (NLA) which can contain a large number of virtual sensors in MIMO radar system. When multiple targets are closely located in spatial domain, the proposed approach can significantly enhance the resolution and estimation accuracy relative to the conventional method with uniform linear array (ULA). In the proposed approach, no peaking searching is needed. Notably, it fits the situation that the number of targets is equal or even larger than that of the receive sensors, which is unavailable for the conventional MIMO radar system. The simulations validate the performance of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603470.pdf","startPage":"1904","endPage":"1909","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-target direction finding in MIMO radar exploiting nested array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","MIMO radar","Receivers","Transmitters","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","diversity reception","linear antenna arrays","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar detection","radar receivers","sensors","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitarget direction finding","multiple-input multiple-output radar","MIMO radar model","transmit antennas","transmit diversity","radar receiver","2-level nested array","direction finding","nonuniform linear array","NLA","virtual sensors","estimation accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","direction finding","nested array","virtual aperture","transmit diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-target direction finding in MIMO radar exploiting nested array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603470/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408985","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-target direction finding in MIMO radar exploiting nested array","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a1904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066082S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603514,"authors":[{"name":"Luxiu Yin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Luxiu","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085886268"},{"name":"Wenfeng He","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Wenfeng","lastName":"He","id":"37085386998"},{"name":"Juan Luo","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085390054"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603514","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Virtual machining","Servers","Algorithm design and analysis","Resource management","Distributed databases","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","energy conservation","power aware computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud data center","cloud service providers","cloud tenants","power-on servers","user experience","VMP","dependability based distributed virtual machine placement","energy efficiency","D2VMP","power-on physical machines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clustering","data center","dependability","virtual machine placement"]}],"abstract":"One of primary and challenging difficulties in placing virtual machine (VM) onto physical machines in a cloud data center, is to balance the interests of both cloud service providers (CSPs) and cloud tenants, which are often expressed as minimizing the number of power-on servers and improving user experience respectively. However, the current research on VMP try to gathering the requested VMs on the fewest possible activated PMs for the purpose of reducing the number of power-on physical machines, without taking the experience of cloud tenants in to account. In this study, we define and formulate the VMP problem in cloud data center, and design a VMP strategy named Dependability based Distributed Virtual Machine Placement algorithm (D2VMP), with the placement goals of energy efficiency and dependability. To maintain the dependability of user requests D2VMP limits the number of virtual machines from the same request assigned on each physical machine. Furthermore, to ensure minimize the number of power-on physical machines, we propose to divide the data center into several clusters, and thus, different requests can reuse activated clusters. The experimental results demonstrate that proposed algorithm can effectively lower the power-on devices and maintain service-dependability.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603514","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580922/7603138/07603514.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603514","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)","startPage":"2152","endPage":"2158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed virtual machine placement based on dependability in data centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Distributed virtual machine placement based on dependability in data centers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603514/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397904","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed virtual machine placement based on dependability in data centers","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"a2152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05691S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580922","isNumber":"7603138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580922","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7603138","articleId":"7603514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603522,"authors":[{"name":"Chuang Deng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Deng","id":"37085878202"},{"name":"Junyong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Junyong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085407913"},{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537594100"},{"name":"Zhen Yu","affiliation":["China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085887679"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4093-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4092-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4094-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7603522","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing based high-performance platform in enabling scalable services in power system","abstract":"This paper discusses the characteristics of the cloud computing techniques and further compares the features of the cloud computing to those of the traditional distributed computing.

The TC-PIM can be used for measurement while drilling system to extend the transmission distance of the mud pulse telemetry system.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603639","startPage":"522","endPage":"525","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580934/7603539/07603639.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A trellis coded pulse interval modulation for measurement while drilling telemetry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"A trellis coded pulse interval modulation for measurement while drilling telemetry","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603639/","accessionNumber":"16409331","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603639/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A trellis coded pulse interval modulation for measurement while drilling telemetry","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"RP099P1280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049953S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580934","isNumber":"7603539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580934","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7603539","articleId":"7603639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7603652,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihao Fang","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhihao","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085738265"},{"name":"Hua Cheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085730678"},{"name":"Gengguo Cheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Gengguo","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37069223200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8644-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2605-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8645-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"7603652","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","MIMO radar","MIMO","State-space methods","Azimuth","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fornasini-Marchesini model realization","MIMO radar image","elementary operation approach","multiinput and multioutput radar","MIMO radar 3-D image display","FM-II local state-space model multidimensional systems","matrix fraction description","MIMO radar 3-D image realization","n-D polynomial matrix","computer program","software implementation effectiveness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar 3-D image","Fornasini-Marchesini state-space model","Multidimensional systems","Right matrix fraction description"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the problem for the image processing of multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) radar which based on the structural properties of Fornasini-Marchesini second model (FM-II) is presented.

Street lamps should be protected by automatic detection devices, and with the continuous development of communication technology, such as Zigbee wireless and G3-PLC power line communication technologies, extensive street lamp monitoring and energy conservation management becomes feasible.

Currently, most commercial pipe inspection systems are designed with one or more Closed-circuit Television (CCTV) cameras. These systems are slow, costly and have limited accuracy (caused by human and environmental factors). More sophisticated systems (Laser-based, Infrared Thermography, Ultrasonic-based and Ground Penetrating Radar) suffer from: low resolution, high noise, high operational costs and an inability to detect water infiltration. The main objective of this research is to apply stereo vision and robust image processing to generate 3D images of anomalies in sewer pipes in order to achieve high efficiency and accuracy for pipe inspection. The results show that various types of defects are successfully detectable. In addition, the correspondence time can be reduced by up to 45% and the accuracy of disparity maps is maintained compared to traditional local correspondence algorithms. Each component of the proposed system was tested individually with real and simulated data sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications

partial face recognition under missing parts, occlusions and data corruptions is a major challenge for the practical application of the techniques of 3D face recognition. Moreover, one individual can only provide one sample for training in most practical scenarios, and thus the face recognition with single sample problem is another highly challenging task. We propose an efficient framework for 3D partial face recognition with single sample addressing both of the two problems. First, we represent a facial scan with a set of keypoint based local geometrical descriptors, which gains sufficient robustness to partial facial data along with expression/pose variations. Then, a two-step modified collaborative representation classification scheme is proposed to address the single sample recognition problem. A class-based probability estimation is given during the first classification step, and the obtained result is then incorporated into the modified collaborative representation classification as a locality constraint to improve its classification performance. Extensive experiments on the Bosphorus and FRGC v2.0 datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach when addressing the problem of 3D partial face recognition with single sample.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603727","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580934/7603539/07603727.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient 3D partial face recognition approach with single sample","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603727/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient 3D partial face recognition approach with single sample","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16397972","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603727/","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient 3D partial face recognition approach with single sample","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"RP187P1412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068902S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580934","isNumber":"7603539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7603539","articleId":"7603727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603776,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085896629"},{"name":"Yinhui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of SEL, Samsung Mobile R&D Center China-Tianjin, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yinhui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37858135600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8644-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2605-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8645-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"7603776","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603776","abstract":"In view of the traditional image edge detection method easily lead to the disadvantage such as burr and discontinuous, use LVQ neural network to detect the digital image edge.

In NSCT band-pass subband fusion, a PCNN motivated by the NSCT band-pass subbands directional coefficients, is employed to extract the image details. The saliency complementarity of different kinds of source images is tested and analyzed. A new fusion quality evaluation index, visual saliency difference, is proposed to measure the performance in terms of visual consistency of the fusion algorithms. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the quality of fused images, while the proposed visual consistency index can accurately evaluate the visual consistency of the fusion algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7603780/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16398015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Vision model based image fusion in nonsubsampled contourlet transform domain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision model based image fusion in nonsubsampled contourlet transform domain","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"RP240P1083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084414S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580934","isNumber":"7603539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580934","xplore-issue":"7603539","articleId":"7603780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7603783,"authors":[{"name":"Karthick Thiyagarajan","affiliation":["Centre for Autonomous Systems, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Karthick","lastName":"Thiyagarajan","id":"37085642434"},{"name":"Sarath Kodagoda","affiliation":["Centre for Autonomous Systems, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Sarath","lastName":"Kodagoda","id":"37403026000"},{"name":"Nalika Ulapane","affiliation":["Centre for Autonomous Systems, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Nalika","lastName":"Ulapane","id":"37891635800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8644-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2605-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8645-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"7603783","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603783","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concrete","Moisture","Temperature measurement","Resistance","Corrosion","Surface treatment","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corrosion","data handling","estimation theory","Gaussian processes","hydrogen compounds","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis","reinforced concrete","sanitary engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven machine learning approach","concrete volumetric moisture content prediction","resistance sensor measurements","sewerage industry","hydrogen sulphide induced corrosion","reinforced concrete corrosion","concrete moisture content estimation","pH concentration","Gaussian process regression modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gaussian Process","hydrogen sulphide corrosion","prediction","resistance sensor","volumetric concrete moisture content"]}],"abstract":"In sewerage industry, hydrogen sulphide induced corrosion of reinforced concretes is a global problem.

The bearing fault mode can then be determined by analysis of the period of the transient signals. Many advanced signal processing algorithms have been proposed to realize period detection, but majority of them are complicated and require adequate computational resource. This paper proposed a new method characterized by low computational cost and low memory occupation, to detect the period of transient signals for bearing fault diagnosis. First, the fault-induced impulse signals are demodulated using the squaring and low-pass filtering envelope algorithm. Subsequently, the period of the envelope signal is estimated using the signal segmentation and labeling algorithm. Note that the proposed method avoids the complex convolution operation and hence it is suitable for implementing in an embedded system. Finally, experimental verification is conducted on a micro control unit to diagnose the bearing faults.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603802","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1393","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580934/7603539/07603802.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient signal period detection for bearing fault diagnosis using amplitude demodulation and signal segmentation and labeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Transient signal period detection for bearing fault diagnosis using amplitude demodulation and signal segmentation and labeling","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603802/","accessionNumber":"16398056","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603802/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient signal period detection for bearing fault diagnosis using amplitude demodulation and signal segmentation and labeling","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"RP262P1456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050758S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580934","isNumber":"7603539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7603539","articleId":"7603802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7603804,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

It is commonly known as a black-box approach in the sense that examples (input and output pairs) are learned in the process of establishing an ANN model. However, there is a long debate in literature on whether ANN is a white-box or a black-box approach. In this article, we take a more conceptual view towards the nature of modelling with ANN, leading to a conclusion that ANN can be a black-box or grey-box approach, depending on the way to create an ANN model, in particular whether the knowledge of the problem and/or domain of the problem to be modeled by ANN is used in the creation of the ANN model. Another contribution of this paper is the outline of a methodology for designing ANN models, which is based on our proposed view in this paper that designing an ANN model is like designing a product and then the design theory and methodology for general products is learned to designing an ANN model.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603804","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1404","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580934/7603539/07603804.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On membership of black-box or white-box of artificial neural network models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Mathematical model","Neurons","Force","Acceleration","Biological system modeling","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["white-box approach","artificial neural network models","ANN","black-box approach","grey-box approach","product designing","design theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ANN","black-box approach","white-box approach","fuzzy logics","modelling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"On membership of black-box or white-box of artificial neural network models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603804/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2016","accessionNumber":"16398034","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On membership of black-box or white-box of artificial neural network models","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"RP264P1331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053802S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580934","isNumber":"7603539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580934","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7603539","articleId":"7603804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7603807,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyuan Dong","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085901620"},{"name":"Xuanzuo Ye","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuanzuo","lastName":"Ye","id":"37085898963"},{"name":"Xiongxiong He","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiongxiong","lastName":"He","id":"37280960300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8644-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2605-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8645-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"7603807","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Calibration","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Biological cells","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","cameras","genetic algorithms","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Matlab camera calibration toolbox method","genetic algorithm","computer vision","geometrical information","camera intrinsic parameter","reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["camera calibration","calibration toolbox","genetic algorithm","Harris algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603807","abstract":"Camera calibration is a key technology in the field of computer vision.

Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method effectively reduces the motor stator current magnitude and the power losses, increases the efficiency while maintaining the fast dynamic response feature of the conventional direct torque control.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Industrial electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor drives","permanent magnet motors","polynomial approximation","synchronous motors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","maximum torque per ampere","IPMSM drives","direct torque control strategy","MTPA control strategy","polynomial approximation","stator flux linkage","electromagnetic torque","motor stator current magnitude","power losses","fast dynamic response feature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","direct torque control","maximum torque per ampere","dynamic stator flux regulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603826","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 11th Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580934/7603539/07603826.pdf","startPage":"1519","endPage":"1524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7603539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct torque control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with maximum torque per ampere","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct torque control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with maximum torque per ampere","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7603826/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7603826/","accessionNumber":"16398059","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct torque control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with maximum torque per ampere","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"RP286P1203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051071S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580934","isNumber":"7603539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580934","xplore-issue":"7603539","articleId":"7603826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7603828,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Bao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Bao","id":"37553422700"},{"name":"Cheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085887869"},{"name":"Hanfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hanfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085472801"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8644-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2605-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8645-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"7603828","dbTime":"50 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7603828","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Air gaps","Coils","Induction motors","Magnetic fields","Rotors","Stator cores"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","induction motors","machine insulation","magnetic fields","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic field monitoring","stator yoke","eccentricity fault detection","induction motor","financial loss reduction","minimum air gap position","eccentric troubleshooting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eccentricity fault","magnetic field","stator yoke","search coils"]}],"abstract":"The induction motor easily fails eccentricity fault, which deteriorates performances of motor or even makes the motor break down.

This paper proposes to use computationally efficient optimisation approach to design a set of orthogonal pulse shaping waveforms to reduce the PAPR of the MU-OFDM signal.

In cluster analysis, a major problem is to determine the appropriate number of cluster in advance. It is difficult for a user (data miner) to estimate the appropriate number of clusters in advance. Another limitation of a well-known clustering technique called K-means is that it gets stuck at local optima. In order to overcome these limitations Genetic Algorithm (GA) based clustering techniques have been proposed in the 1990s. Since then many researchers have developed several evolutionary algorithm based clustering techniques, including GA and applied in various fields. This paper presents an up-to-date review of some major GA-based clustering techniques for the last twenty (20) years. A total of 45 ranked (i.e. based on citation reports and JCR/CORE rank) GA-based clustering approaches are reviewed, which are uses for real-life applications such as real-life data sets, highway construction projects, a Gas Company, cellular networks and satellite image segmentations. Almost two third of the techniques do not require any user to define the number of clusters.

Modeling the thermal dynamics of LEDs is hence essential in designing thermal dissipators and controllers for maintaining constant illuminance or chromaticity. In the existing literature, both physical modeling and system identification have been proposed, which all find the dependence of the temperature on the input power. When the power fluctuates, e.g., due to dimming control, the thermal dynamics becomes nonlinear. Moreover, when a photoelectrothermal model is used in the control synthesis, the nonlinearity due to the product of the temperature-dependent efficacy and the input power must be considered. These nonlinearities are either ignored or linearized in most existing methods. The main contribution of this work is treating the aforementioned nonlinearities in a linear parameter varying (LPV) framework.

The fact that terminals on a network have a limited battery capacity and are in desperate need to high energy efficiency transmission schemes compels us to tackle these crucial challenges. In this paper, we propose an SR-DCSK system that performs simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). This promising design exploits the saved time gained from the fact that reference signal duration of SR-DCSK scheme occupies less than half of the bit duration to transmit a signal. The aim of this system is to allow receivers to perform without being equipped with any external power supply. Furthermore, at the receiver side, an RF-to-dc conversion is first performed, followed by data recovery without the need to any channel estimator. Closed-form expressions of multiple-input single-output SR-DCSK SWIPT system, such as ergodic rate, harvesting time, energy shortage, and data outage as well as exact and approximate bit error rate probabilities are derived under Rayleigh fading channel and are validated via simulation. Our results show that the proposed solution saves energy without sacrificing the non-coherent fashion of the system or reducing the rate compared to conventional DCSK, while keeping the design simple.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2619707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2619707","startPage":"431","endPage":"443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07604059.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Scheme for Short Reference DCSK Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design of Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Scheme for Short Reference DCSK Communication Systems","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598292","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7604059/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC discovery","grantNumber":"435243-2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Scheme for Short Reference DCSK Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-kaddoum-2619707-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160483S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7604059","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7604063,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7886374/7604063/liu-2619690-small.gif","p":["Yi Liu (S'15) was born in Hubei, China.

However, the state-of-the-art LC filter design of a buck dc-dc converter is limited to the specifications of voltage and current ripples and constrains in power density and cost without reliability considerations. This paper proposes a method to optimize the design of the LC filters from a reliability perspective, besides other considerations. An enhanced model is derived to quantify the lifetime of the capacitor in the filter considering the electrothermal stress on it. Furthermore, the influence of different design aspects such as the value of capacitance, the value of inductance, and the type of the capacitor have been discussed, focusing on their impacts on the key design objectives, which are the cutoff frequency, lifetime, and volume. Based on the analysis, an optimized design is proposed among different parameter sets. A 1-kW converter prototype is applied to verify the theoretical analysis and simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16773937","volume":"32","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7604063/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Oriented Optimization of the LC Filter in a Buck DC-DC Converter","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51507118 and 51637007"},{"fundingName":"Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Support Program","grantNumber":"2015BAA109"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities Program","grantNumber":"410500078"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Oriented Optimization of the LC Filter in a Buck DC-DC Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-huang-2619690-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100819S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7886374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7886374","articleId":"7604063","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7604073,"authors":[{"name":"Huakai Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Communication Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huakai","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0002-8268-4885","id":"37086139449"},{"name":"Shenghao Yang","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Shenghao","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0003-1987-5643","id":"37537744600"},{"name":"Guangliang Dong","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Communication Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangliang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086140371"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7604073","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Network coding","Packet loss","Performance evaluation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","matrix algebra","network coding","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["batched sparse codes","matrix generalization","fountain codes","outer code","random linear network coding","intermediate network nodes","transfer matrix ranks","performance evaluation","degree distribution optimization","BATS codes","finite-length performance evaluation method","computational complexity","batch size","polynomial-form formula"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coding","BATS code","finite-length analysis","LT code","belief propagation","polynomial form"]}],"abstract":"Batched sparse (BATS) codes have been proposed for communication through networks with packet loss.

Traditional statistics-based approaches are widely used, but they may lack adaptivity to different data structures. Quantum clustering (QC), derived from quantum mechanics and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, demonstrates excellent capability in finding the structure and conformity toward data distribution. In this paper, a novel neural networks model called quantum local potential function networks (QLPFNs) is proposed. The QLPFN inherits the outstanding properties of QC by constructing the waves and the potential functions, and the level of data concentration can be discovered to obtain the inherent structures of the given data set. The local potential functions form the basic components of the QLPFN structure, which are automatically generated from the subsets of training data following specific subspace division procedures. Therefore, the QLPFN model in fact incorporates the level of data concentration as a computation technique, which is different from the classical RBFN model that exhibits radial symmetry toward specific centers. Some application examples are given in this paper to show the effectiveness of the QLPFN model.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2614840","startPage":"63","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2614840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8244326","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8244326/07604076.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Quantum Local Potential Function Networks Based on Quantum Assimilation and Subspace Division","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604076/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Development of Quantum Local Potential Function Networks Based on Quantum Assimilation and Subspace Division","volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7604076/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17468815","pubMedId":"27775911","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"fund project Z132014B002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Quantum Local Potential Function Networks Based on Quantum Assimilation and Subspace Division","sourcePdf":"tnnls-cui-2614840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091967S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8244326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8244326","articleId":"7604076","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7604078,"authors":[{"name":"Abdurrahman Alfitouri","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K.","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Engineering Academy Tajoura, Tripoli, Libya"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7604078/alfit-2619697-small.gif","p":["Abdurrahman Alfitouri (S\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree in\n electrical and electronic engineering from the Engineering Academy Tajoura, Tripoli, Libya, in 2004 and the M.Sc.\n degree in mobile communication engineering from Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK, in 2012.

There are two main problems in the networked control systems, the time-varying networked-induced delay and the data packet dropouts. The time-varying networked-induced delays cause degradation for the system performance that controlled over network and also the system can be unstable. Moreover, the delay problem is aggravated when packet losses occur during the transmission of data. The proposed controller has a filtered error to handle the networked-induced delays. Furthermore, it is robust to overcome some packet losses. The unknown nonlinear functions of the system are approximated using fuzzy logic systems. The robustness of the proposed controller is achieved by combining the adaptive fuzzy controller with H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n control technique. The Lyapunov stability analysis is used to prove that the proposed controller is asymptotically stable. Stability of the whole closed loop system is guaranteed via the proposed controller in the presence of bounded external disturbance, data packet dropouts and time-varying networked-induced delays.

Active cell balancing is an important task of a BMS, performed in order to improve the usable capacity of the battery pack by equalizing the charge levels of individual cells. With the emerging trend of distributed BMS topologies, the associated balancing architectures are required to be modular, consisting of homogeneous units that minimize integration efforts. In this paper, we propose a modular active charge balancing architecture along with its control scheme for implementation toward such distributed BMSs. Compared with existing approaches, our proposed architecture provides increased charge transfer capabilities, with reduced hardware and control complexity. We propose a closed-form analytical model of the balancing architecture, which can be used to perform fast system-level simulation studies and design space exploration for analyzing efficient device combinations. A hardware implementation of the proposed balancing architecture is developed and measurements made with it are used to validate each part of our analytical model. Using the validated analytical model, we performed a case study, which shows that our proposed architecture provides a 14.5 % improvement in charge transfer efficiency compared with existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2611526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2611526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7862316/07604081.pdf","startPage":"974","endPage":"987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular Active Charge Balancing for Scalable Battery Packs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Modular Active Charge Balancing for Scalable Battery Packs","volume":"25","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604081/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16691038","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604081/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation under the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular Active Charge Balancing for Scalable Battery Packs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-narayanaswamy-2611526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119067S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7862316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7862316","articleId":"7604081","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7604083,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Xia","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, 4 Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Xia","orcid":"0000-0001-6255-9297","id":"38236301800"},{"name":"Mengsu Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, 4 Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Mengsu","lastName":"Yang","id":"38238483900"},{"name":"Anding Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, 4 Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Anding","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085448838"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7604083","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1149},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Impedance","Wideband","Impedance matching","Wireless communication","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved Doherty amplifier design","minimum phase delay","output matching network","wideband application","DPA","wideband operation","impedance transformation","load modulation network","LTE signal","frequency 1.6 GHz to 2.2 GHz","efficiency 51 percent to 55 percent","frequency 20 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Back-off","Doherty","high efficiency","output matching network","power amplifiers","wideband"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604083","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7736161/07604083.pdf","startPage":"915","endPage":"917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2016.2615004","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2016.2615004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Doherty Amplifier Design with Minimum Phase Delay in Output Matching Network for Wideband Application","abstract":"This letter presents an improved Doherty power amplifier (DPA) for high-efficiency and wideband operations.

Besides bearings (not discussed here), the weak point of an electric motor is its insulating system. For inverter-fed motors, the inception of partial discharges might lead to failure in a matter of days, and thus, deserves particular attention. Qualification and lifetime evaluation of inverter-fed machines are described in IEC 60034-18-41, which specifies accelerated aging procedures and considers partial discharge inception as the end-of-life criterion. This standard was used as a reference for this paper. The only exception is that insulation models were subjected to the mechanical stress profile reported in the ISO 16750-3-2012 standard since an automotive motor is subject to significant vibrations during its operation. From the tests performed, we observed that, with the hairpin technology, turn-to-turn is the weakest link in the insulation system. All the insulation models were partial discharge (PD) free from the beginning of the tests to breakdown and the root cause for breakdown was, in all cases, traced back to cracks on the surface of the insulation. This suggests that, depending on insulating enamel thickness and conductor geometry, some insulation systems are intrinsically PD free by design, despite the effect of aging. Considering the severe vibration profiles typical of EVs, and the principal breakdown mechanism (cracking of the insulation), mechanical stress coupled with thermal stress appears as the main aging driver. Therefore, this paper spotlights the lack of proper standards for the qualification of automotive electric motors and hints at the possibility that IEC 60034-18-41 considers dealing with motors that might be intrinsically partial discharge free even after long-term exposure to operational stresses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16898626","volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7604085/","publicationDate":"May-June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Qualification of Hairpin Motors Insulation for Automotive Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004964","fundingName":"European Union's Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"FP7/2013-2016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000783","fundingName":"REA","grantNumber":"605075"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Qualification of Hairpin Motors Insulation for Automotive Applications","sourcePdf":"tia-mancinelli-2619670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06615S","chronDate":"May-June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7931767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7931767","articleId":"7604085","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7604086,"authors":[{"name":"Redouane Sassioui","affiliation":["UQAM, Montreal, Canada","INRS\u2013EMT, Montreal, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7604086/sassi-2619716-small.gif","p":["Redouane Sassioui (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree from INPT, Rabat, Morocco, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications from INRS, Montreal, Canada, in 2015.

In order to elucidate their compatibility and interaction, we compare the throughput provided by AMC, HARQ, and their combination (AMC-HARQ) under two operational conditions: in slow- and fast block-fading channels. Considering both incremental redundancy HARQ and repetition redundancy HARQ, we optimize the rate-decision regions for AMC/HARQ and compare them in terms of attainable throughput. Under a fairly general model of the channel variation and the decoding functions, we conclude that: 1) adding HARQ on top of AMC may be counterproductive in the high average signal-to-noise ratio regime for fast fading channels and 2) HARQ is useful for slow fading channels, but it provides moderate throughput gains.

Evaluation results demonstrate that it achieves up to 99% accuracy of activity detection and extends the network lifetime by supporting balanced energy consumption among sensors.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619700","startPage":"757","endPage":"760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7894297/07604087.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7894297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Activity-Aware Sensor Cycling for Human Activity Monitoring in Smart Homes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Activity-Aware Sensor Cycling for Human Activity Monitoring in Smart Homes","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16807360","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7604087/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002380","fundingName":"Hanyang University","grantNumber":"HY-2015-G"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Activity-Aware Sensor Cycling for Human Activity Monitoring in Smart Homes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-park-2619700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041338S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7894297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7894297","articleId":"7604087","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7604088,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Kontik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ko\u00e7 University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Kontik","id":"37085760665"},{"name":"Sinem Coleri Ergen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ko\u00e7 University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sinem","lastName":"Coleri Ergen","orcid":"0000-0002-7502-3122","id":"37085421852"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7604088","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1426},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604088","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Media Access Protocol","Receivers","Transmitters","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision mechanism","message exchange","SIC-based wireless networks","distributed communication protocol","interference avoidance","successive interference cancellation-based wireless ad hoc networks","distributed medium access control protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless ad hoc networks","successive interference cancellation","distributed algorithm","medium access control protocol"]}],"abstract":"Successive interference cancellation (SIC) enables the successful reception of multiple concurrent transmissions and elimination of interference through successive decoding. However, previously proposed distributed medium access control protocols have not exploited SIC. They mostly focused on either interference avoidance, based on the assumption that a receiver can only decode one transmission at a time, or self-interference cancellation, where a node can be a receiver and a transmitter at the same time. In this letter, we propose the first distributed communication protocol for SIC-based wireless networks, based on a novel message exchange and decision mechanism, to enable the simultaneous transmission of multiple neighboring nodes around the transmitter and receiver. The message exchange allows a random subset of neighboring nodes to test the feasibility of their simultaneous transmission. The decision mechanism evaluates the successive decoding capability of SIC receivers with the additional activation of neighboring nodes. We demonstrate the throughput improvement of the proposed algorithm via extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2619702","startPage":"354","endPage":"357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07604088.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Medium Access Control Protocol for Successive Interference Cancellation-Based Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Medium Access Control Protocol for Successive Interference Cancellation-Based Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668420","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7604088/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Turk Telekom Collaborative Research","grantNumber":"#11315-10"},{"fundingName":"Bilim Akademisi-The Science Academy, Turkey under the BAGEP program"},{"fundingName":"Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA) within the Young Scientist Award Program (GEBIP)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Distributed Medium Access Control Protocol for Successive Interference Cancellation-Based Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-coleriergen-2619702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067865S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7604088","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7604090,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel B.

The goal of this paper is to determine transducer design parameters that produce either a specified shock amplitude in the focal waveform or specified peak pressures while still maintaining quasi-linear conditions at the focus. Multiparametric nonlinear modeling based on the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov (KZK) equation with an equivalent source boundary condition was employed. Peak pressures, shock amplitudes at the focus, and corresponding source outputs were determined for different transducer geometries and levels of nonlinear distortion. The results are presented in terms of the parameters of an equivalent single-element spherically shaped transducer. The accuracy of the method and its applicability to cases of strongly focused transducers were validated by comparing the KZK modeling data with measurements and nonlinear full diffraction simulations for a single-element source and arrays with 7 and 256 elements. The results provide look-up data for evaluating nonlinear distortions at the focus of existing therapeutic systems as well as for guiding the design of new transducers that generate specified nonlinear fields.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of HIFU Transducers for Generating Specified Nonlinear Ultrasound Fields","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2619913","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7840079/07604090.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2619913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7840079","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of HIFU Transducers for Generating Specified Nonlinear Ultrasound Fields","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7604090/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16649999","pubMedId":"27775904","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006769","fundingName":"Russian Science Foundation","grantNumber":"14-12-00974"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"EB007643 and P01 DK43881"},{"fundingName":"NSBRI through NASA","grantNumber":"NCC 9-58"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of HIFU Transducers for Generating Specified Nonlinear Ultrasound Fields","sourcePdf":"tuffc-khokhlova-2619913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122143S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7840079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7840079","articleId":"7604090","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7604092,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Dolinay","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Control Engineering, Tomas Bata University in Zl\u00edn, Zl\u00edn, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Dolinay","orcid":"0000-0002-6603-8509","id":"37705810700"},{"name":"Petr Dost\u00e1lek","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Control Engineering, Tomas Bata University in Zl\u00edn, Zl\u00edn, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Dost\u00e1lek","id":"37705946200"},{"name":"Vladim\u00edr Va\u0161ek","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Control Engineering, Tomas Bata University in Zl\u00edn, Zl\u00edn, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Vladim\u00edr","lastName":"Va\u0161ek","id":"38251980100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0663"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0671"}],"articleNumber":"7604092","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Debugging","Virtualization","Light emitting diodes","Programming","Ports (Computers)","Visualization","Microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","computer science education","program debugging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Arduino debugger","source-level debugger","GNU debugger","Eclipse","visual front-end","user application","teaching","embedded programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arduino","engineering education","microcontrollers","software debugging"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604092","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563995/7738317/07604092.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LES.2016.2619692","doi":"10.1109/LES.2016.2619692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arduino Debugger","abstract":"This letter describes our source-level debugger for Arduino which can be used to debug the code in Arduino using GNU debugger.

Due to the limited saturation power of the mmWave power amplifier, we consider the per-antenna power constraint (PAPC). We first propose a metric, termed generalized detection probability (GDP), to evaluate the quality of an arbitrary codeword. This metric not only enables an optimization approach for mmWave codebook design, but also can be used to compare the performance of two different codewords/codebooks. To the best of our knowledge, GDP is the first such metric, particularly for mmWave codebook design. We then propose a heuristic approach to design a hierarchical codebook exploiting beam widening with the multi-RF-chain sub-array (BMW-MS) technique. To obtain crucial parameters of BMW-MS, we provide two solutions, namely, a low-complexity search (LCS) solution to optimize the GDP metric and a closed-form (CF) solution to pursue a flat beam pattern. Performance comparisons show that BMW-MS/LCS and BMW-MS/CF achieve very close performances, and they outperform the existing alternatives under the PAPC.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2619705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2619705","startPage":"141","endPage":"153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07604098.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Codebook Design for Millimeter-Wave Channel Estimation With Hybrid Precoding Structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Codebook Design for Millimeter-Wave Channel Estimation With Hybrid Precoding Structure","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618427","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7604098/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571025, 91538204, 91338106 and 61231013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61521091"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Codebook Design for Millimeter-Wave Channel Estimation With Hybrid Precoding Structure","sourcePdf":"twc-xiao-2619705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088562S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7604098","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7604101,"authors":[{"name":"Yvon Erhel","affiliation":["Engineering Science Department, Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications, Rennes"],"bio":{"p":["Yvon Erhel (yvon.erhel@st-cyr.terre-net.defense.gouv.fr) is a full professor and the head of the Engineering Science Department at the French Military Academy and member of the Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes.

This project, involving decametric wavelengths, has to cope with the constraints of reasonable array dimensions at both ends of the radio link. Therefore, this work considers a diversity in transmitted polarizations as an alternative to the classical spatial diversity and, more specifically, the generation of complementary circular polarizations. The design of the corresponding system is described with a focus on antenna arrays, waveforms, and signal processing for channel sounding. This novel communication system has been tested on a 850-km long radio link to exhibit the degree of diversity provided by the ionospheric MIMO channel. The measurements indicate a significantly low level of correlation for the four-channel transfer functions linking the transmitting and receiving ends (in a frequency dispersive context).

The D2D devices are assumed to be capable of operating at the full duplex (FD) mode to enable the concurrent transmission and reception with a single frequency band. We analyze the impact of activating D2D users on the throughput of FD-based D2D (FD-D2D) aided underlaying network by considering non-ideal self-interference cancellation at the FD devices. Despite of an extra interference imposed on the cellular users (CUs) by the active D2D links, which may erode the signal-to-interference ratio of the former significantly, the FD-D2D mode is still shown to exhibit its superiority in terms of the throughput improvement. Furthermore, in order to avoid a severe FD-D2D-induced interference imposed on the CUs, a new mechanism called \u201cdynamic cellular link protection (DCLP),\u201d which prohibits the transmissions of FD-D2D users when they are located inside the pre-set guard areas, is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed DCLP mechanism is capable of substantially improving the throughput of the underlaying cellular networks without seriously eroding the capacity of the conventional cellular links.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16470554","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604106/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Improvement in Cellular Networks via Full-Duplex Based Device-to-Device Communications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61431001"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing, Ministry of Education (Guilin University of Electronic Technology)"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Beijing Engineering and Technology Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Throughput Improvement in Cellular Networks via Full-Duplex Based Device-to-Device Communications","sourcePdf":"access-chai-2619379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077229S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7604106","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7604109,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Alberto Garcia-Calva","affiliation":["HSPdigital CA Telematica, DICIS, University of Guanajuato, Salamanca, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7849237/7604109/calva-2619318-small.gif","p":["Tomas Alberto Garcia-Calva (S\u201907) received the B.S. degree in\n electronics engineering from the University of Guanajuato, Salamanca, Mexico, in 2014, where he is currently working\n toward the M.S. degree in electrical engineering.","He was an Intern with the Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain, and with the Universitat Politecnica de\n Valencia, Valencia, Spain, in 2016.

Many line-fed machines are being replaced by inverter-fed drives for improving control during startup and also for saving energy. Broken rotor bars (BRBs) in IMs is one of the most difficult faults to be detected, particularly when the motor is fed by an inverter in a soft startup. The difficulty of detecting BRBs is that the characteristic fault-related frequencies are very close to the fundamental frequency, and the amplitude of the fundamental is significantly higher than the fault-related frequency components. This paper proposes an effective method that allows the detection of the BRB fault in inverter-fed IMs during a soft startup transient based on a non-uniform resampling algorithm. The proposed algorithm transforms the nonstationary fundamental frequency into a stationary component by non-uniform resampling, whereas the fault-related components are considerably separated from the fundamental one, making easier to follow their evolution during the startup transient. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to detect the fault.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7604109/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16668349","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Non-Uniform Time Resampling for Diagnosing Broken Rotor Bars in Inverter-Fed Induction Motors","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Mexican Council of Science and Technology CONACYT scholarship","grantNumber":"572940"},{"fundingName":"Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro Sabbatical Scholarship","grantNumber":"2015-2016"},{"fundingName":"Universidad de Guanajuato DAIP","grantNumber":"733/2016"},{"fundingName":"Universidad de Valladolid Grant for foreign professors in the doctoral","grantNumber":"2015\u20132016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Uniform Time Resampling for Diagnosing Broken Rotor Bars in Inverter-Fed Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-romerotroncoso-2619318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066568S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7604109","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7604119,"authors":[{"name":"Georg Tanzmeister","affiliation":["BMW Group, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7935171/7604119/tanzm-2608919-small.gif","p":["Georg Tanzmeister received the B.Sc. degree in computer science in 2009 from Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Vienna, Austria; the Dipl.-Ing. degree in computer graphics and computer vision in 2011 from Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Vienna, Austria; and the Dr.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering in 2016 from Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany.","In 2008, he was a Research Student with Universitat Autnoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, and in 2009 with City College of New York, New York City, USA.

They are often realized separately using occupancy grids, which do not require object or shape assumptions, and model-based object tracking algorithms. Many approaches require a binary classification of the sensor measurements into coming from a static or from a dynamic object, as otherwise inconsistencies between the different representations are likely to occur. This paper presents grid-based tracking and mapping (GTAM), a low-level grid-based approach that simultaneously estimates the static and the dynamic environment, their uncertainties, velocities, as well as information about free space. GTAM works on the level of grid cells, rather than creating object hypotheses. A particle filter is used to obtain continuous cell velocity distributions for all obstacles. Continuous evidences in a Dempster-Shafer model are derived without requiring a binary pre-classification of the sensor measurements.

Conventional video quality metrics, such as peak-signal-to-noise-ratio and quality of service, only focus on the reception quality from the systematic perspective. As a result, they cannot represent the true visual experience of an individual user. Instead, the QoE introduces a user experience-driven strategy which puts special emphasis on the contextual and human factors in addition to the transmission system. This advantage has raised the popularity and widespread usage of QoE in video transmission. In this paper, we present an overview of selected issues pertaining to QoE and its recent applications in video transmission, with consideration of the compelling features of QoE (i.e., context and human factors). The selected issues include QoE modeling with influence factors in the end-to-end chain of video transmission, QoE assessment (including subjective test and objective QoE monitoring) and QoE management of video transmission over different types of networks. Through the literature review, we observe that the context and human factors in QoE-aware video transmission have attracted significant attentions since the past two to three years. A vast number of high quality works were published in this area, and will be highlighted in this survey. In addition to a thorough summary of recent progresses, we also present an outlook of future developments on QoE assessment and management in video transmission, especially focusing on the context and human factors that have not been addressed yet and the technical challenges that have not been completely solved so far. We believe that our overview and findings can provide a timely perspective on the related issues and the future research directions in QoE-oriented services over video communications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoE in Video Transmission: A User Experience-Driven Strategy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2016.2619982","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7862305/07604120.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2016.2619982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604120","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9739/7862305/7604120-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604120/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2017","displayDocTitle":"QoE in Video Transmission: A User Experience-Driven Strategy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7604120/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2017","accessionNumber":"16691056","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671152, 91538203 and 61601080"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1405594"},{"fundingName":"New York State Empire Innovation Program"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Gift Funding"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"QoE in Video Transmission: A User Experience-Driven Strategy","sourcePdf":"comst-zhao-2619982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211817S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7862305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7862305","articleId":"7604120","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7604121,"authors":[{"name":"Robin Kalyan","affiliation":["Centre for Applied Research in Electronics, IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7835239/7604121/kalya-2614930-small.gif","p":["Robin Kalyan (S\u201913) received the M.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, India, in 2012.

In addition to the reconfiguration of frequencies of operation, the output power back-off (OPBO) region for efficiency enhancement can also be reconfigured in this DPA. As a proof of concept, a reconfigurable and concurrent dual-band DPA is designed to operate at 1500 and 2140 MHz in the first concurrent dual band, whereas on reconfiguration it will operate concurrently at 1850 and 2350 MHz. While operating in the first concurrent dual band, the DPA has an enhanced efficiency region up to 6-dB OPBO level and, after reconfiguration to the second concurrent dual band, this region extend up to 9-dB OPBO level. The proposed DPA is tested using continuous wave (CW) signals in single mode as well as in concurrent mode. Measurement results using CW signals in single mode reveal a drain efficiency of 52%-56% at 6-dB OPBO in the first concurrent dual band. Similarly, in the second concurrent dual band, a drain efficiency of 43%-48% is achieved at around 9-dB OPBO. The peak drain efficiency at saturation is better than 60% in all the four operating bands. The measured aggregated drain efficiencies are 49% and 44% in the first and second concurrent dual bands for 6 and 9 dB OPBO level, respectively. The measured carrier to the third-order intermodulation distortion is better than 17 dBc for all of the operating bands.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2614930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7835239/07604121.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"208","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2614930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable and Concurrent Dual-Band Doherty Power Amplifier for Multiband and Multistandard Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable and Concurrent Dual-Band Doherty Power Amplifier for Multiband and Multistandard Applications","volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7604121/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16637100","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, DST INSPIRE Fellowship, and Astra Microwave Private Ltd., Hyderabad, India","grantNumber":"SB/S3/EECE/047/2014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable and Concurrent Dual-Band Doherty Power Amplifier for Multiband and Multistandard Applications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kalyan-2614930-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066815S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7835239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7835239","articleId":"7604121","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":7604123,"authors":[{"name":"Sathish Kumar Kollimalla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7882730/7604123/kolli-2619759-small.gif","p":["Sathish Kumar Kollimalla (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the\n Bachelor's degree from the Viswanadha Institute of Technology and Management College of Engineering,\n Visakhapatnam, India, in 2003, and the Master's degree in engineering from Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, in\n 2006.

High fluctuations in power generation may negatively impact the voltage stability of the microgrid. This problem can be alleviated by using hybrid energy storage system consisting of batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) at dc grid. A new control scheme is proposed to control the power sharing between batteries and SCs to match the generation-demand mismatch and hence to regulate the grid voltage. In the proposed control strategy, the SC supplies error component of the battery current in addition to the fast transient power demand. This added feature not only improves the dc grid voltage regulation capability but also reduces the stress levels on the battery and hence increases the life span of the battery. The main advantage of the scheme is that, the uncompensated power due to slow dynamics of the battery is diverted to the SC and keeps the state of charge within the limits for longer duration, as compared to the conventional strategy. The proposed scheme is validated through detailed experimental studies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC Grid Voltage Regulation Using New HESS Control Strategy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2016.2619759","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7882730/07604123.pdf","startPage":"772","endPage":"781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2016.2619759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7882730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"DC Grid Voltage Regulation Using New HESS Control Strategy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7604123/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16759583","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006143","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, India","grantNumber":"SB/S3/EECE/056/2015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC Grid Voltage Regulation Using New HESS Control Strategy","sourcePdf":"tste-kollimalla-2619759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087213S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7882730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7882730","articleId":"7604123","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7604126,"authors":[{"name":"Yoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Nanoenergy Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311190900"},{"name":"Myounggon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Korea National University of Transportation, Chungju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myounggon","lastName":"Kang","orcid":"0000-0003-4132-0038","id":"37552906300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"7604126","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1511},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memories","Three-dimensional displays","Threshold voltage","Electric potential","Transistors","Two dimensional displays","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","circuit simulation","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating channel down-coupling phenomenon","3D NAND flash memory","floating channel DCP","channel potential","program disturbance","cell-distribution characteristics","computer-aided design simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D NAND flash memory","channel potential","program inhibit string","down-coupling phenomenon (DCP)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we have investigated the down-coupling phenomenon (DCP) of inhibited channel potential in 3D NAND flash memory. The inhibited channel in the 3D NAND flash structure can easily be in the floating state, because its channel is not directly connected to its body. This floating channel behavior can adversely affect memory operation. Specifically, during program and verify operation, the DCP reduces the boosting potential of the inhibit string. Consequently, the insufficient channel potential leads to a large program disturbance and deterioration of the cell-distribution characteristics.

One of recent trends in this research topic is to propose identification algorithms for multiple antenna (MA) systems with multi-carrier (MC) transmissions. The previously reported investigations are limited to space-time block code (STBC) systems with MC transmissions. However, practical systems include also space-frequency block code (SFBC) schemes with MC transmissions. In this paper, we develop and analyze an SFBC identification algorithm for MA orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission for the first time in the literature. Analytical expressions for the time-domain properties of the Alamouti and spatial multiplexing SFBC-OFDM signals are derived as the basis of the identification process. The proposed algorithm is divided into two steps. The first step estimates the cross-correlation function of pairs of signals received from different antennas, while the second step employs a false-alarm based test for decision making. The proposed algorithm avoids the need for a priori knowledge of the modulation format, channel coefficients, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value, and the starting time of OFDM symbols. Simulation results show the ability of the proposed algorithm to provide an acceptable identification performance in the presence of transmission impairments, even at relatively low SNR values. These favorable results are achieved with acceptable computational cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07604129.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2619676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2619676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Identification of Space-Frequency Block Coding for OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Block codes","Wireless communication","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","OFDM modulation","space-time block codes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic identification","space-frequency block coding","OFDM systems","signal identification","intelligent wireless communication systems","identification algorithms","multiple antenna systems","multicarrier transmissions","space-time block code systems","MC transmissions","SFBC identification","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing transmission","multiplexing SFBC-OFDM signals","cross-correlation function","false-alarm based test","decision making","modulation format","channel coefficients","signal-to-noise ratio value","SNR values","identification performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind signal identification","OFDM","space-frequency block codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Identification of Space-Frequency Block Coding for OFDM Systems","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7604129/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618446","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, through its Discovery program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Identification of Space-Frequency Block Coding for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-marey-2619676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083377S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7604129","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7604130,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This hardware accelerator technology improves the practicality of computing on encrypted data by reducing the computational bottlenecks of lattice encryption primitives that support homomorphic encryption schemes. We focus on accelerating the Chinese Remainder Transform (CRT) and inverse Chinese Remainder Transform (iCRT) for power-of-2 cyclotomic rings, but also accelerate other basic ring arithmetic such as Ring Addition, Ring Subtraction and Ring Multiplication. We instantiate this capability in a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA that can attach to a host computer through either a PCI-Express port or Ethernet. We focus our experimental performance analysis on the NTRU-based LTV Homomorphic Encryption scheme. This is a leveled homomorphic encryption scheme, but our accelerator is compatible with other lattice-based schemes and recent improved bootstrapping designs to support arbitrary depth computation. We experimentally compare performance with a reference software implementations of the CRT and iCRT bottlenecks and when used in a practical application of encrypted string comparison.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2016.2619669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7938807/07604133.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7938807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2016.2619669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing an FPGA-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption Co-Processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Designing an FPGA-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption Co-Processor","htmlLink":"/document/7604133/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2017","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2017","accessionNumber":"16931649","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007270","fundingName":"University of Michigan"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006919","fundingName":"MIT"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)","grantNumber":"FA8750-11-C-0098"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing an FPGA-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption Co-Processor","sourcePdf":"tetc-rohloff-2619669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155022S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7938807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7938807","articleId":"7604133","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7604139,"authors":[{"name":"Roozbeh Mohammadian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7604139/moham-2619699-small.gif","p":["Roozbeh Mohammadian received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Shiraz University in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

Such design is applicable to downlink of massive-MIMO systems and also to scenarios where multiple users transmit to a base station at the same carrier frequency. In our design, we deviate from the conventional orthogonal pilot arrangements by assigning the same pilot subcarriers to all transmitters. In the proposed setting, the achieved improvement in spectral efficiency (by reducing pilot overhead) may come at the expense of a more challenging channel estimation block at the receiver. To address this challenge and distinguish between different signals that are arriving at the receiver at the same subcarrier, we propose to select pilot subcarriers through minimizing the coherence of the associated Fourier submatrix, as well as properly assigning different pilot values (complex numbers) to each individual transmitter. We demonstrate that if the channels are sparse enough in time domain, there are simple sparse recovery techniques to simultaneously estimate all the channels, although all transmitters share the same pilot subcarriers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design outperforms existing methods in terms of both mean-square channel estimation error and bit error rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deterministic Pilot Design for Sparse Channel Estimation in MISO/Multi-User OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2619699","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07604139.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2619699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic Pilot Design for Sparse Channel Estimation in MISO/Multi-User OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7604139/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618457","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006115","fundingName":"Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003968","fundingName":"Iran National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"95824827"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic Pilot Design for Sparse Channel Estimation in MISO/Multi-User OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-amini-2619699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112051S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7604139","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7604140,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7900486/7604140/zhu-2612695-small.gif","p":["Rui Zhu received the B.E. degree in electrical and information engineering and the M.Sc. degree in cryptography from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

Traditional network latency prediction schemes attempt to estimate the latencies between all pairs of nodes in a network based on sampled round-trip times, through either Euclidean embedding or matrix factorization. However, these schemes become less effective in terms of estimating the latencies of personal devices, due to unstable and time-varying network conditions, triangle inequality violation and the unknown ranks of latency matrices. In this paper, we propose a matrix completion approach to network latency estimation. Specifically, we propose a new class of low-rank matrix completion algorithms, which predicts the missing entries in an extracted \u201cnetwork feature matrix\u201d by iteratively minimizing a weighted Schatten-p norm to approximate the rank. Simulations on true low-rank matrices show that our new algorithm achieves better and more robust performance than multiple state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms in the presence of noise. We further enhance latency estimation based on multiple \u201cframes\u201d of latency matrices measured in the past, and extend the proposed matrix completion scheme to the case of 3-D tensor completion. Extensive performance evaluations driven by real-world latency measurements collected from the Seattle platform show that our proposed approaches significantly outperform various state-of-the-art network latency estimation techniques, especially for networks that contain personal devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"25","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16808680","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7604140/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Network Latency Estimation for Personal Devices: A Matrix Completion Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC Discovery Grants"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Latency Estimation for Personal Devices: A Matrix Completion Approach","sourcePdf":"tnet-zhu-2612695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12581S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7900486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7900486","articleId":"7604140","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7604160,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2356"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2364"}],"articleNumber":"7604160","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid State Circuits Society","url":"http://sscs.ieee.org//"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Test Technology Technical Council","url":"http://tab.computer.org/tttc/index.html"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604160","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Test data compression"]}],"abstract":"Presents corrections to the paper, \"A DfT architecture and tool flow for 3D-SICs with test data compression, embedded cores, and multiple towers, \" (Papameletis, C., et al), IEEE Design Test, vol. 32, no. 4, pp. 40\u201348, Jul-Aug. 2015.

In this work, multi-model system is defined as architecture with different models depending on the input characteristic. The outputs of these models are integrated by a decision layer, thus multi-level, which computes the probability of an eczema case. The resulting system has 68.37% average confidence level as opposed to the 63.01% of the single level, i.e. Single model, system in the actual testing of eczema versus non-eczema cases.

Optimization Based on Velocity Clamping and Particle Penalization","abstract":"The idea of particle swarm optimization falls under the domain of swarm intelligence. Particle swarm optimization technique is widely used for finding the global minima of well-known benchmark functions. The main idea behind this technique is that working in a group improves the performance of a system. A modified particle swarm optimization technique is proposed in this paper and tested on seven standard benchmark functions. The two major modifications are introduced in the standard particle swarm optimization, modify the velocity of a particle such that the particle remains within the confine limits of clamp velocity, and penalize the particle velocity, if the sum of the velocity vector and position vector results in breaching the boundary limits of search space. The results of the modified PSO are compared with the two versions of standard PSO, constant inertial weight with no velocity clamping and linearly decreasing inertial weight with no velocity clamping.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604552/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16410403","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604552/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Velocity Clamping and Particle Penalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Velocity Clamping and Particle Penalization","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"8675a061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04734S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7602796","isNumber":"7604529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602796","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7604529","articleId":"7604552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7604569,"authors":[{"name":"Nila Feby Puspitasari","affiliation":["Department of Informatics Engineering, STMIK AMIKOM Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Nila Feby","lastName":"Puspitasari","id":"37085892424"},{"name":"Hanif Al Fatta","affiliation":["Department of Informatics Engineering, STMIK AMIKOM Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Hanif Al","lastName":"Fatta","id":"37085888755"},{"name":"Ferry Wahyu Wibowo","affiliation":["Department of Informatics Engineering, STMIK AMIKOM Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ferry Wahyu","lastName":"Wibowo","id":"38489702500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8675-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8676-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7604569","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Simulated annealing","Receivers","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy algorithms","radiowave propagation","RSSI","simulated annealing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal wireless access point placement","simulated annealing algorithm","greedy algorithm","access point layout","wireless fidelity network","Wi-Fi network","inSSIDer application","signal strength measurement","RSSI","receive signal strength indication","line of sight propagation","LoS propagation","nonline of sight propagation","NLoS propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["access point","greedy","optimization","simulated"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604569","abstract":"Optimization of the access point layout is one of the issues in the field of networking. This issue is relating to the layout of access point on the Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) network that requires theoretical consideration and analysis. Because of these requirements, a good mechanism is applied in the minimizing aspects between both cost and time on the implementation of WiFi network that used by network designer to organize the layout of the access points in the proper place. In addition, the signal strength obtained by measuring of the two nodes using in SSIDer application and the parameter used to measure the signal strength is the value of RSSI (Receive Signal Strength Indication) generated by the receiver. Not only that aspects used in the implementation of optimal placement of wireless access point, but measurement of the propagation of Line of Sight (LoS) and propagation Non Line of Sight (NLoS) is also considered in the aspect of measurement. The data obtained from the measurements are used to model layout of the access point using Greedy and Simulated Annealing application which has been built and tested.

The performance of LTE system for different packet size is done. The simulation experiments are done using Mat lab and Simulink libraries. The results show and discuss the effects of packet size and adaptation modulation on the performance of LTE based on throughput and packet loss. Moreover, the Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold values can be optimized in order to enhance the performance of LTE system.

This paper examines minimum-energy operation of 2T and 3T1D e-DRAM gain cells as an alternative to SRAM at 32nm technology node with different design points: up-sizing transistors, using high-Vth transistors, read/write wordline assists and temperature. First, the e-DRAM cells are evaluated without considering any process variations. The design-space is explored by creating a kriging meta-model to reduce the number of simulations. Finally, a full-factorial statistical analysis of e-DRAM cells is performed in presence of threshold voltage variations. The effect on mean MEP is also reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604667/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16410061","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7604667/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis and comparison of 2T and 3T1D e-DRAM minimum energy operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis and comparison of 2T and 3T1D e-DRAM minimum energy operation","confLoc":"Sant Feliu de Guixols, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP1222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05817S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589476","isNumber":"7604654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589476","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7604654","articleId":"7604667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7604668,"authors":[{"name":"Hailong Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37399495600"},{"name":"Yongmin Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, AZ, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yongmin","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085901516"},{"name":"Volkan Kursun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Volkan","lastName":"Kursun","id":"37267138900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1507-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1506-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1508-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"7604668","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604668","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","Transistors","Circuit stability","CMOS technology","Arrays","Leakage currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","SRAM chips","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static random access memory circuits","variations-tolerant 9T SRAM circuit","robust SLEEP mode","low leakage SLEEP mode","data stability","write ability","leakage power consumption","CMOS technology scaling","asymmetrically ground-gated nine-transistor","MTCMOS SRAM circuit","data retention capability","worst-case static noise margin","write voltage margin","die-to-die process parameter variations","size 65 nm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604668","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589476/7604654/07604668.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variations-tolerant 9T SRAM circuit with robust and low leakage SLEEP mode","abstract":"Design of static random access memory (SRAM) circuits is challenging due to the degradation of data stability, weakening of write ability, increase of leakage power consumption, and exacerbation of process parameter variations with CMOS technology scaling.

This goal is achieved by both relaxing strict requirements on accuracy and precision, and by allowing a deviating behavior from exact Boolean specifications to a certain extent. Today, approximate computing is often limited to applications with a certain degree of inherent error tolerance, where perfect computational results are not always required. However, in order to fully utilize its benefits, the scope of applications has to be significantly extended to other compute-intensive domains including science and engineering. To meet the often rather strict quality and reliability requirements for computational results in these domains, the use of appropriate characterization and fault tolerance measures is highly required. In this paper, we evaluate some of the available techniques and how they may extend the scope of application for approximate computing.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604686","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589476/7604654/07604686.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pushing the limits: How fault tolerance extends the scope of approximate computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Pushing the limits: How fault tolerance extends the scope of approximate computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410077","htmlLink":"/document/7604686/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pushing the limits: How fault tolerance extends the scope of approximate computing","confLoc":"Sant Feliu de Guixols, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP31S33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050199S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589476","isNumber":"7604654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589476","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7604654","articleId":"7604686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7604688,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab of EDA, Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen (RITS), Shenzhen, China","School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085568255"},{"name":"Wenhui Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Capital International Airport Co.

Most of the existing soft error mitigation methods depend on triple modular redundancy (TMR) or dual-modular redundancy (DMR) to the original design target directly, which enlarge the resource overhead dramatically. In this paper, the high level synthesis (HLS) is considered to help to reduce the resource consumptions of TMR or DMR. By the HLS on node sensitivity, all design resources can be classified into three types: sensitive submodules, semi-sensitive sub-modules, and insensitive submodules. TMR can be applied for sensitive sub-modules to provide the highest reliability, while gate sizing can be applied for semi-sensitive sub-modules, which can help to mitigate the soft errors and to minimize the overhead introduced by the fault-tolerant techniques efficiently. In order to verify the effectiveness of the above proposal, appropriate scheduling schemes combined with the HLS are performed to an FIR filter. By simulations it is shown that, with the reduction of area relative to TMR over 60% for the FIR design, the reliability can reach over 99.9%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HLS-based sensitivity-inductive soft error mitigation for satellite communication systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604688","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589476/7604654/07604688.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"HLS-based sensitivity-inductive soft error mitigation for satellite communication systems","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604688/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410081","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HLS-based sensitivity-inductive soft error mitigation for satellite communication systems","confLoc":"Sant Feliu de Guixols, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP3372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106407S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589476","isNumber":"7604654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589476","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7604654","articleId":"7604688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7604689,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris Theodoropoulos","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics & Telecommunications, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Theodoropoulos","id":"37577142400"},{"name":"Nektarios Kranitis","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics & Telecommunications, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Nektarios","lastName":"Kranitis","id":"37276966100"},{"name":"Antonios Paschalis","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics & Telecommunications, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Antonios","lastName":"Paschalis","id":"37276972300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1507-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1506-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1508-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"7604689","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":735},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Testing","Robustness","System analysis and design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","convolutional codes","field programmable gate arrays","matrix algebra","parity check codes","protocols","space communication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC encoder architecture","space application","quasicyclic low-density parity-check code","QCLDPC","consultative committee for space data system","CCSDS code","channel coding","near-earth communication","deep-space communication","DVB-S2","IEEE 802.11e","AR4JA","recursive convolutional encoder","matrix QC structure","throughput performance","FPGA","C2 code","data-link layer protocol","framing","synchronization","randomization","Xilinx XUPV5 development board"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward Error Correction","CCSDS","QC-LDPC","encoder","FPGA implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604689","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589476/7604654/07604689.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604689","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604654","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient LDPC encoder architecture for space applications","abstract":"Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes (QC-LDPC) have been recently adopted by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) as recommended standard for channel coding in near-earth (C2) and deep-space (AR4JA) communications. Existing QC-LDPC encoder architectures proposed in the literature so far, are optimized for other standards (e.g. DVB-S2, IEEE 802.11e), but they are not suitable for efficient implementations for the specific CCSDS codes. In this paper, we introduce for the first time a novel encoder architecture, suitable for these codes. The architecture is a parallel implementation based on a series of recursive convolutional encoders and it leverages the inherent parallelism of generator's matrix QC structure to boost throughput performance. Furthermore, the generic definition of key encoder's parameters provides increased flexibility in terms of latency, FPGA resources and speed. In the special case of C2 code for near-earth communications, a novel architecture is introduced to efficiently handle the challenges arising from the generator's matrix circulant size (511 bits), which is not a power of 2. The proposed encoders operate on a continuous uninterrupted stream of input data and implement all the functions specified by CCSDS data-link layer protocols (i.e. framing, synchronization and randomization). The efficiency of the introduced architecture is demonstrated on a Xilinx XUPV5 development board, achieving multi-Gbps throughput and a significant speed-up when compared with existing approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604689/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16410057","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7604689/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient LDPC encoder architecture for space applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient LDPC encoder architecture for space applications","confLoc":"Sant Feliu de Guixols, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP3473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055639S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589476","isNumber":"7604654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589476","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7604654","articleId":"7604689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7604690,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The increasing adoption of this standard requires the availability of algorithms and tools to automate its usage. Since the resulting networks could inevitably be affected by defects which may prevent their correct usage, solutions allowing not only to test against these defects, but also to diagnose them (i.e., to identify the location of possible faults) are of uttermost importance. This paper proposes a method to automatically generate suitable test stimuli: by applying them and observing the output of the network one can not only detect possible faults, but also identify the fault responsible for the misbehavior. Experimental results gathered on a set of benchmark networks with a prototypical tool implementing the proposed techniques show the feasibility and provide a first idea about the length of the required input stimuli.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589476/7604654/07604692.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic generation of stimuli for fault diagnosis in IEEE 1687 networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Instruments","Fault diagnosis","Standards","Registers","Testing","Flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","IEEE standards","network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic stimuli generation","fault diagnosis","IEEE 1687 network","configurable module","controllable switch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Automatic generation of stimuli for fault diagnosis in IEEE 1687 networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604692/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16410079","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic generation of stimuli for fault diagnosis in IEEE 1687 networks","confLoc":"Sant Feliu de Guixols, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP3783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081506S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589476","isNumber":"7604654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589476","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7604654","articleId":"7604692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7604699,"authors":[{"name":"Patryk Skoncej","affiliation":["Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg, Cottbus, Germany","IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Skoncej","id":"37077499200"},{"name":"Felix M\u00fchlbauer","affiliation":["University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"M\u00fchlbauer","id":"37546321400"},{"name":"Felix Kubicek","affiliation":["University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Kubicek","id":"37085898315"},{"name":"Lukas Schr\u00f6der","affiliation":["University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Schr\u00f6der","id":"37085904044"},{"name":"Mario Sch\u00f6lzel","affiliation":["University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany","IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Sch\u00f6lzel","id":"37393515900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1507-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1506-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1508-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"7604699","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility of software-based repair for program memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604699","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Maintenance engineering","Redundancy","Embedded systems","Hardware","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program memories","software-based repair","NOR flash","embedded systems","error-correcting code","post-production memory faults","radiation-related memory faults","flash memory devices","memory size 32 KByte to 64 KByte"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we evaluate the feasibility of software-based repair for program (NOR flash) memories in tiny embedded systems.

In this paper, we propose a hardware-Trojan classification method to identify hardware-Trojan infected nets (or Trojan nets) using a support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, we extract the five hardware-Trojan features in each net in a netlist. Secondly, since we cannot effectively give the simple and fixed threshold values to them to detect hardware Trojans, we represent them to be a five-dimensional vector and learn them by using SVM. Finally, we can successfully classify a set of all the nets in an unknown netlist into Trojan ones and normal ones based on the learned SVM classifier. We have applied our SVM-based hardware-Trojan classification method to Trust-HUB benchmarks and the results demonstrate that our method can much increase the true positive rate compared to the existing state-of-the-art results in most of the cases. In some cases, our method can achieve the true positive rate of 100%, which shows that all the Trojan nets in a netlist are completely detected by our method.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604700","startPage":"203","endPage":"206","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604654","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589476/7604654/07604700.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Trojans classification for gate-level netlists based on machine learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604700/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hardware Trojans classification for gate-level netlists based on machine learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604700/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16410066","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Trojans classification for gate-level netlists based on machine learning","confLoc":"Sant Feliu de Guixols, Spain","sourcePdf":"RP45105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059364S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589476","isNumber":"7604654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589476","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7604654","articleId":"7604700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7604741,"authors":[{"name":"Jennifer Zaini","affiliation":["CEA, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France","University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Zaini","id":"37085895316"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hameau","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Hameau","id":"37542658200"},{"name":"Thierry Taris","affiliation":["CEA, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Taris","id":"37400145300"},{"name":"Dominique Morche","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Morche","id":"37346781800"},{"name":"Le Quang Vinh Tran","affiliation":["ERCOM TELECOM, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Le Quang","lastName":"Vinh Tran","id":"37088406192"},{"name":"Patrick Audebert","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Audebert","id":"37064019400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8900-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8901-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7604741","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Power demand","Batteries","Wireless sensor networks","Peer-to-peer computing","Mathematical model","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","radio receivers","statistical analysis","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel aware receiver front end","low power wireless sensor network","adaptative receiver","power consumption trade-off","statistical analysis","smart threshold optimization","WSN battery lifetime","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel aware receiver","Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)","RF front end","WSN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604741","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604733","publicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589473/7604733/07604741.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel aware receiver front end for low power 2.4 GHz Wireless Sensor Network: A system level analysis","abstract":"In this paper, a system level analysis for channel aware receiver is described.

Simulation results demonstrate that the OTA achieves a dc gain of 78 dB and realizes the anticipated, pre-defined closed-loop response while driving a 1-pF capacitive load.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604746","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589473/7604733/07604746.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Top-down design and synthesis of inherently-stable integrator-based high-order amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Top-down design and synthesis of inherently-stable integrator-based high-order amplifiers","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604746/","accessionNumber":"16410032","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604746/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Top-down design and synthesis of inherently-stable integrator-based high-order amplifiers","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037308S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589473","isNumber":"7604733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589473","xplore-issue":"7604733","articleId":"7604746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7604748,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Auras","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Auras","id":"37392230200"},{"name":"Rainer Leupers","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Leupers","id":"37085338897"},{"name":"Gerd Ascheid","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Ascheid","id":"37268217800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8900-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8901-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7604748","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"abstract":"Non-linear detection for multi-antenna (MIMO) systems using iterative detection and decoding offers superior communications performance at the cost of an increased computational complexity.

Switched DC-DC converters are highly efficient, but their output voltage exhibits a small switching ripple. These unwanted variations on the supply of the SCPA mix with the input code and create unwanted harmonics in the output signal. This effect decreases the linearity of the SCPA, and potentially causes violations of the spectral mask. Currently, additional circuitry is used to block the DC-DC voltage ripple and provide a stable power supply for the SCPA. Such circuits decrease the efficiency of the system and need additional active and passive components on and off-chip. This work proposes a digital compensation of the distortions of the DC-DC voltage ripple in the SCPA to omit additional circuitry in the SCPA supply. Furthermore, a proper solution to eliminate timing mismatches of the modulated input code and the true ripple at the SCPA is presented. The concept has been validated with MATLAB/Simulink and shows a significant suppression of the distortions created by the DC-DC voltage ripple.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604749","publicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589473/7604733/07604749.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital compensation of DC-DC converter voltage ripple for Switched-Capacitor Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Digital compensation of DC-DC converter voltage ripple for Switched-Capacitor Power Amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7604749/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16409972","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604749/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital compensation of DC-DC converter voltage ripple for Switched-Capacitor Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043931S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589473","isNumber":"7604733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589473","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7604733","articleId":"7604749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7604755,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"Ming Yang","id":"37087148506"},{"name":"Gordon W.

Unfortunately, tiny batteries exhaust quickly, and replacing so many of them frequently is impractical. This is why recharging them with ambient energy is so appealing, especially when vibrations, for example, are abundant and steady. Still, tiny piezoelectric transducers draw so little power that they hardly damp motion. Luckily, pre-damping the transducer draws more power. This paper shows that symmetrical and asymmetrical pre-damping strategies draw the same power, but of the two, the proposed symmetrical case consumes less energy and therefore outputs more power. With this approach, the proposed system consumes 82% less power and generates 7.8\u00d7 more output power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Batteries","Damping","Capacitors","Transducers","Switches","Vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","microsensors","piezoelectric transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damp motion","piezoelectric transducers","ambient energy","wireless microsensor","piezoelectric energy-harvesting charger","optimally predamped switched-inductor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Switched-inductor charger","piezoelectric harvester","transducer","damping","ambient kinetic energy","vibrations","motion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604767","publicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589473/7604733/07604767.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimally pre-damped switched-inductor piezoelectric energy-harvesting charger","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimally pre-damped switched-inductor piezoelectric energy-harvesting charger","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604767/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604767/","accessionNumber":"16409969","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimally pre-damped switched-inductor piezoelectric energy-harvesting charger","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC","sourcePdf":"4059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063919S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589473","isNumber":"7604733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589473","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7604733","articleId":"7604767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7604770,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Sawaby","affiliation":["Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sawaby","id":"37085890908"},{"name":"Amr S.

In MEMS-based vibratory gyroscope systems, an AGC is used to regulate the vibration amplitude of an inertia mass. Traditional analog AGCs suffer from a limited control range or bulky elements. Here, we present a low gain P-controller (Fine tuning) with digitally-controlled dynamic bias (Coarse tuning) for the AGC loop. The dynamic bias compensates for the low loop gain through the AGC and is generated using an error sense ADC. This approach achieves more than 9bits of uncalibrated oscillation amplitude accuracy over PVT without the need for trimming the gyroscope actuation gain. The power consumption of the designed main amplitude control circuitry is less than 200\u03bcW. The overall circuit was built using a standard 0.13\u03bcm CMOS technology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604770","publicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589473/7604733/07604770.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed-mode self-calibrated amplitude control scheme for MEMS vibratory gyroscopes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Mixed-mode self-calibrated amplitude control scheme for MEMS vibratory gyroscopes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7604770/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16398220","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604770/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed-mode self-calibrated amplitude control scheme for MEMS vibratory gyroscopes","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052236S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589473","isNumber":"7604733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589473","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7604733","articleId":"7604770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7604779,"authors":[{"name":"Nassim Bouassida","affiliation":["IMS Lab, University of Bordeaux, France","STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Nassim","lastName":"Bouassida","id":"37085884903"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Rivet","affiliation":["IMS Lab, University of Bordeaux, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Rivet","id":"37403070000"},{"name":"Yann Deval","affiliation":["IMS Lab, University of Bordeaux, France"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Deval","id":"37277062400"},{"name":"David Duperray","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Duperray","id":"38271131800"},{"name":"Andreia Cathelin","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Andreia","lastName":"Cathelin","id":"37268157800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8900-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8901-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7604779","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"abstract":"This paper presents a very promising architecture that is suited for a Full Software Radio (FSR) transmitter. The core system is made of two blocks: one generates a set of square sequences and is named Walsh Sequences Synthesizer, while the other, the Walsh digital-to-analog converter (DAC), performs the conversion, by summing and dynamically weighing the sequences with a reduced set of coefficients. The resulting piecewise linear signal, corresponding to the Walsh series of the wanted signal, is summed as current steps into a differential load. System and circuit simulations have been carried out and demonstrate that the generation of concurrent modulated signal is possible with a rejection of 40 dBr over 10GHz bandwidth. With only moderate hardware complexity, it provides promising performances to pave the way to the implementation of a multi-carrier, multistandard radio frequency transmitter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Radio transmitters","Generators","MATLAB","Transistors","Synthesizers","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","radio transmitters","silicon-on-insulator","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent transmitter","CMOS FDSOI technology","Walsh sequences generator","full software radio transmitter","FSR transmitter","Walsh digital-to-analog converter","DAC","core system","piecewise linear signal","multicarrier transmitter","multistandard radiofrequency transmitter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604779","publicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589473/7604733/07604779.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A concurrent transmitter in CMOS 28nm FDSOI technology based on Walsh sequences generator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A concurrent transmitter in CMOS 28nm FDSOI technology based on Walsh sequences generator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604779/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604779/","accessionNumber":"16410055","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A concurrent transmitter in CMOS 28nm FDSOI technology based on Walsh sequences generator","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042427S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589473","isNumber":"7604733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589473","xplore-issue":"7604733","articleId":"7604779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7604784,"authors":[{"name":"Eugene Koskin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Koskin","id":"37085667775"},{"name":"Elena Blokhina","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Blokhina","id":"37272786000"},{"name":"Chuan Shan","affiliation":["LIP6 Lab, UPMC Sorbonne Universites, Paris Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Shan","id":"38236401900"},{"name":"Eldar Zianbetov","affiliation":["CEA, INAC-SPINTEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Eldar","lastName":"Zianbetov","id":"37601610200"},{"name":"Orla Feely","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"firstName":"Orla","lastName":"Feely","id":"37270041400"},{"name":"Dimitri Galayko","affiliation":["LIP6 Lab, UPMC Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, 4 place Jussieu, 75252 Paris Cedex 05, France"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Galayko"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8900-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8901-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7604784","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device modeling","Lead","Measurement uncertainty","Manganese","Transient analysis","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital phase locked loops","integrated circuit modelling","jitter","phase detectors","time-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-time modelling","clock-generating networks","mathematical model","all-digital phase-locked loop","ADPLL","time-to-digital phase detector","nonlinear discrete-time map","Matlab Simulink","CMOS ADPLL","single PLL simulation","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we derive a mathematical model of an All-Digital Phase-Locked Loop (ADPLL) employing a time-to-digital phase detector.

In this paper, the performance of a RNN/BCH-hybrid error correction scheme for reducing the effect of false-positive detection is demonstrated through an experimental evaluation using a general purpose microprocessor.","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604786","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589473/7604733/07604786.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","publicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of a top-down error correction technique using Recurrent-Neural-Network-based learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"A study of a top-down error correction technique using Recurrent-Neural-Network-based learning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16409997","publicationDate":"June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7604786/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of a top-down error correction technique using Recurrent-Neural-Network-based learning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042978S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589473","isNumber":"7604733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589473","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7604733","articleId":"7604786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7604788,"authors":[{"name":"Marek Parfieniuk","affiliation":["Department of Digital Media and Computer Graphics, Bialystok University of Technology, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Parfieniuk","id":"37283440800"},{"name":"Sang Yoon Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and MPEES-ARC, Myongji University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Yoon","lastName":"Park","id":"37085846986"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8900-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8901-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7604788","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quaternions","Logic gates","Transforms","Switches","Hardware","Two dimensional displays","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinate rotation digital computer","hypercomplex numbers","constant coefficient","area-efficient quaternion multipliers","ASIC","FPGA","sparse-iteration 4D CORDIC circuit","area overheads","versatile hardware multipliers","transform-type algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604788","abstract":"A sparse-iteration 4D CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) has recently been developed for multiplying hypercomplex numbers one of which is a constant coefficient.

By decomposing the target matrix into the Kronecker product of smaller matrices, this paper proposes a new multi-level matrix generator architecture built by interconnection of several matrix generators of small sizes and additional arrays of AND gates. The additional AND gates incurred by our new matrix generator can be integrated with those AND gates required in the partial-sum update circuit when forming PSG such that only two extra AND gates are required for the proposed PSG based on two-level matrix generator architecture. The required number of D flip-flops and XOR gates of two-level matrix generator is only about 50% of the conventional one. Considering the entire PSG module, the overall reduction ratio is still more than 16%.

To validate the effectiveness of different scheduling algorithms, an emulation of an LTE uplink virtualized stack is made. Experiments are carried out using a runtime system, StarPU, coupled with profiling tools, which allows characterizing the need for dedicated threads or cores to manage tasks within a server. Reported experimental results confirm the feasibility of software scheduling of an LTE uplink stack with two of the six tested algorithms. In addition, this paper explores distributing the scheduling load across multiple computing units, which is more efficient than implementations where the scheduler is centralized on a dedicated processor.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589473/7604733/07604823.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)","doi":"10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards LTE physical layer virtualization on a COTS multicore platform with efficient scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Uplink","Long Term Evolution","Decoding","Software","Processor scheduling","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","multiprocessing systems","scheduling","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE physical layer virtualization","COTS multicore platform","scheduling","multiprocessor systems","network functions virtualization","NFV","Long Term Evolution","StarPU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Towards LTE physical layer virtualization on a COTS multicore platform with efficient scheduling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604823/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16410008","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards LTE physical layer virtualization on a COTS multicore platform with efficient scheduling","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056572S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589473","isNumber":"7604733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589473","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7604733","articleId":"7604823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7604824,"authors":[{"name":"Marzieh Mehri Dehnavi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Marzieh Mehri","lastName":"Dehnavi","id":"37085890665"},{"name":"Yves Audet","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Audet","id":"37273900300"},{"name":"Elham Khamsehashari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Khamsehashari","id":"37601645000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8900-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8901-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7604824","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":593},"abstract":"A dark current compensation technique for low-light image sensors is presented in this work.

The proposed CSA is intended for capacitive sensor readout circuits, in particular, interface circuits for solid-state detectors used in medical imaging and X-ray spectroscopy. A proof-of-concept interface circuit is designed and fabricated in a 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS process and consists of the proposed CSA, a pole-zero cancellation circuit, and a second-order semi-Gaussian programmable pulse shaper.

Moreover, this amplifier provides an output voltage swing that is almost twice that obtained with single-ended amplifiers. Finally, the two differential pairs at the FDDA input eliminate the need for impedance isolation buffers and matching resistors, consequently reducing system noise for improved sensitivity and accuracy.

In order to resolve this issue, a novel Adaptive CR Enabled Vehicular NETwork (ACREVNET) framework is proposed in this paper. To avoid heavy overhead usually incurred during spectrum sensing, we developed a novel CR adaptive spectrum sensing (CRASS) scheme that can reduce the spectrum sensing cost and improve sensing performance effectively. We also applied the concept of Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) to guarantee fairness in spectral resources allocation and proposed a generalized non-symmetric NBS (GNNBS) to perform a non-symmetric cognitive inter-cell spectrum allocation in the proposed ACREVNET framework. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed schemes can acquire additional spectral resource for vehicular communication by applying CR technology, and reduce the message transmission delay and blocking probability significantly.","doi":"10.1109/IConAC.2016.7604911","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 22nd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585845/7604873/07604911.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IConAC.2016.7604911","publicationTitle":"2016 22nd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio aided Vehicular ad-hoc networks with efficient spectrum allocation and QoS guarantee","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio aided Vehicular ad-hoc networks with efficient spectrum allocation and QoS guarantee","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604911/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7604911/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16398179","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio aided Vehicular ad-hoc networks with efficient spectrum allocation and QoS guarantee","confLoc":"Colchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p_79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06135S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585845","isNumber":"7604873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585845","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7604873","articleId":"7604911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7604918,"authors":[{"name":"Kumaran Rajarathinam","affiliation":["Control Systems Group, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Kumaran","lastName":"Rajarathinam","id":"37085573660"},{"name":"J.

on MAC layer communication performance model of wireless sensor networks for intelligent transportation","abstract":"With the development of MEMS (Micro-electromechanical Systems), the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become an important communicating method for intelligent transportation application. Mathematics modeling, as an effective quantitative analysis method, is very important for conducting intelligent transportation performance research when WSNs are applied. Based on the channel contention mechanism of IEEE802.15.4 standard Media Access Control (MAC) layer unslotted mode, MAC layer mathematics performance model of throughput, goodput, average delay and collision rate is built by analyzing the state of node buffer, state of nodes, and the state of channel. In addtion, the MAC layer mathematics models and corresponding performance are simulated in MATLAB and QualNet respectively. The simulation results indicate that the mathematics models can be used for the real communication quantitative analysis of WSNs MAC layer communication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7604947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7604947/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16398194","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Research on MAC layer communication performance model of wireless sensor networks for intelligent transportation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on MAC layer communication performance model of wireless sensor networks for intelligent transportation","confLoc":"Colchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p_102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0723S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585845","isNumber":"7604873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585845","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7604873","articleId":"7604947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7604969,"authors":[{"name":"Haoyuan Sun","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haoyuan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085888119"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37407524800"},{"name":"Jie Chen","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Chen","id":"38107663500"},{"name":"Jun Jin","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085896392"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-86218-132-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2877-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7604969","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","matrix multiplication","observers","sampled data systems","sampling methods","stability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled-data system","output feedback stabilization problem","sampled-data systems","stochastic sampling","system matrix","eigenvalues","Kronecker product operation","Vandermonde matrix","sufficient condition","stochastic stability","closed-loop system","linear matrix inequality","LMI","cone complementarity linearization algorithm","observer-based output feedback controller design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampled-data system","Observer-based output feedback","Stochastic sampling","Stochastic stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7604969","doi":"10.1109/IConAC.2016.7604969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IConAC.2016.7604969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604873","publicationTitle":"2016 22nd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 22nd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585845/7604873/07604969.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observer-based output feedback control of sampled-data system under stochastic sampling","abstract":"This paper is concerned with output feedback stabilization problem for a class of sampled-data systems under stochastic sampling.

Hybrid spectrum sharing is assumed where the secondary user (SU) can access the primary user (PU) channel in two modes, underlay mode or cooperative mode with admission control. Overlay spectrum sharing allows the SU to occupy the spectrum only when the PU is idle. Cooperation (collaboration) occurs when the SU admits the PU's packet into a relay buffer to transmit in the subsequent timeslots, i.e. timeslots when no successful transmission from the PU source to the destination. In addition to accessing the channel in the overlay mode, secondary user is allowed to access the channel in the underlay mode by occupying the channel currently occupied by the primary user with small transmission power. It is proposed that the secondary user can exploit the underlay access only when the primary channel is at good transmission conditions or predicted to be in non-outage state. The destination sends a feedback message with the received SNR (channel quality status) to the PU source, which is overheard by the SU. The SU exploits the SNR feedback messages to build and update a belief function about the primary channel quality. The belief function leads the SU to select the best access mode each timeslot, underlay or cooperation. We characterize the maximum achievable throughput of our proposed hybrid spectrum sharing. By observing the simulation results, the proposed model attains noticeable improvement in the system performance in terms of maximum secondary user throughput than the conventional cooperation and noncooperation schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16410479","htmlLink":"/document/7605066/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Cooperation and underlay mode selection in cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperation and underlay mode selection in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Luton","sourcePdf":"29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060144S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602797","isNumber":"7605061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602797","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7605061","articleId":"7605066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7605082,"authors":[{"name":"Andrzej O\u017cadowicz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"O\u017cadowicz","id":"37085511781"},{"name":"Jakub Grela","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Grela","id":"37085509705"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4196-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4197-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7605082","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"abstract":"Effective Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) are essential for future smart grids with implemented demand-response concept. Building Automation and Control Systems (BACS) can gather information about power and energy consumption as well as control loads in buildings and dynamically interact with the smart grid. A demand value is crucial in organizing this kind of the BEMS with an active demand side management (DSM). In this paper we propose different approaches to calculate this demand value using time-driven and event-driven mechanisms characteristic for the BACS. These approaches have been implemented. Experiment with real data has been performed to verify this implementation. Results of experiment show that various demand value computing methods could provide different information about demand level from the active DSM point of view. These approaches have been analysed with respect to the accuracy and speed of computing the demand value. Pros and cons predisposing them to various applications has been found and presented for both the time-driven and even-driven mechanisms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An event-driven building energy management system enabling active demand side management","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605082","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585873/7605073/07605082.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7605073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605082","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Energy consumption","Monitoring","Smart grids","Energy efficiency","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","demand side management","energy management systems","power consumption","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven building energy management system","active demand side management","BEMS","smart grid","demand-response concept","building automation and control system","BACS","power consumption","energy consumption","DSM","time-driven mechanism","event-driven mechanism","demand value computing methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["building energy management systems","active demand side management","event-driven builidng automation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An event-driven building energy management system enabling active demand side management","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605082/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16409842","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An event-driven building energy management system enabling active demand side management","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBCCSP2016submission1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083346S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585873","isNumber":"7605073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585873","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7605073","articleId":"7605082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7605083,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Simonov","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore Mario Boella, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Simonov","id":"37945670000"},{"name":"Gianluca Zanetto","affiliation":["Teamware, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Zanetto","id":"37085469931"},{"name":"Gianfranco Chicco","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianfranco","lastName":"Chicco","id":"37272430300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4196-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4197-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7605083","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605083","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time measurement","Energy measurement","Generators","Sensors","Fluid flow measurement","Data compression","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","energy conservation","power meters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","sparse reporting","event-driven metering method","variable energy-transforming process","Lebesgue-based approach","energy vectors","process knowledge","symplectic properties","energy conservation law","sparse sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy measurements","Water measurements","Gas measurements","Event-based communication","Smart grid"]}],"abstract":"The Event-Driven Metering (EDM) method for electricity enabled the detection and better understanding of variable energy-transforming processes from real life.

In order to cope with this problem, over- sampling and undersampling methods are employed. However, these methods are designed for instance based alteration and not specialized for feature space. Also there is not any distinctive approach to cope with class imbalance in defect prediction data sets. We develop HSDD (hybrid sampling for defect data sets) to solve this problem. HSDD comprises not only derivation of low-level metrics, but also reduction processes of repeated data points. The method was evaluated on industrial and open source project data sets by using Bayes, naive Bayes, random forest, and J48 in terms of g-mean and training time. Obtained results show that HSDD produces promising training performance especially in large-scale data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7605093/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16410473","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"HSDD: a hybrid sampling strategy for class imbalance in defect prediction data sets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HSDD: a hybrid sampling strategy for class imbalance in defect prediction data sets","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072553S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7602797","isNumber":"7605061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7602797","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7605061","articleId":"7605093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7605168,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The CNN is trained and run on data from a Dynamic and Active Pixel Sensor (DAVIS) mounted on a Summit XL robot (the predator), which follows another one (the prey). The CNN is driven by both conventional image frames and dynamic vision sensor \u201cframes\u201d that consist of a constant number of DAVIS ON and OFF events. The network is thus \u201cdata driven\u201d at a sample rate proportional to the scene activity, so the effective sample rate varies from 15 Hz to 240 Hz depending on the robot speeds. The network generates four outputs: steer right, left, center and non-visible. After off-line training on labeled data, the network is imported on the on-board Summit XL robot which runs jAER and receives steering directions in real time. Successful results on closed-loop trials, with accuracies up to 87% or 92% (depending on evaluation criteria) are reported. Although the proposed approach discards the precise DAVIS event timing, it offers the significant advantage of compatibility with conventional deep learning technology without giving up the advantage of data-driven computing.","publicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585873/7605073/07605233.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steering a predator robot using a mixed frame/event-driven convolutional neural network","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7605073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Steering a predator robot using a mixed frame/event-driven convolutional neural network","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16409880","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7605233/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steering a predator robot using a mixed frame/event-driven convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBCCSP2016submission19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061497S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585873","isNumber":"7605073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585873","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7605073","articleId":"7605233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7605235,"authors":[{"name":"Fairouz Zobiri","affiliation":["Univ.

Recently, stochastic event-triggering rules have been proposed as a means to avoid the complexity of the problem that normally arises in event-based estimator design. By using a scaled Gaussian function in the stochastic triggering scheme, the optimal remote state estimator becomes a linear Kalman filter with a case dependent measurement update. In this paper we propose a modified version of the stochastic send-on-delta triggering rule. The idea is to use a very simple predictor in the sensor, which allows the communication rate to be reduced while preserving estimation performance compared to regular stochastic send-on-delta sampling. We derive the optimal mean-square error estimator for the new scheme and present upper and lower bounds on the error covariance. The proposed scheme is evaluated in numerical examples, where it compares favorably to previous stochastic sampling approaches, and is shown to preserve estimation performance well even at large reductions in communication rate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Covariance matrices","State estimation","Kalman filters","Extraterrestrial measurements","Networked control

mobile systems. The system must be efficient in terms of resources utilisation like memory, computation complexity, data transmission, battery consumption, etc. In the aim to achieve these features an event driven signal acquisition, processing and transmission chain based on level crossing and activity selection is adopted. It delivers non-uniformly spaced samples. The employment of efficient and mature classical signal processing tools requires the uniform resampling of level crossing sampled signal. In this context, three resampling techniques, Sample&Hold, Nearest Neighbor and Linear Interpolation, for level crossing sampled signal are examined. Their performance is studied in terms of computational complexity and the resampling accuracy. The resampling error is measured in time domain. It has advantages compared to its counter frequency domain methods. Firstly it does not require the computationally complex frequency domain signal transformation. Secondly it does not introduce distortions, could appear during this frequency domain transformation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16409872","publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7605241/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An error measurement for resampled level crossing signal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An error measurement for resampled level crossing signal","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBCCSP2016submission26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054415S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585873","isNumber":"7605073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585873","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7605073","articleId":"7605241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7605246,"authors":[{"name":"Nastaran Asadi Zanjani","affiliation":["Ecole Poly technique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Electronics Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nastaran Asadi","lastName":"Zanjani","id":"37085699507"},{"name":"Johann Bigler","affiliation":["Ecole Poly technique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Electronics Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Johann","lastName":"Bigler","id":"37085775387"},{"name":"Maher Kayal","affiliation":["Ecole Poly technique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Electronics Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Maher","lastName":"Kayal","id":"37276152600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4196-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4197-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7605246","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605246","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Knowledge based systems","Actuators","Aerospace electronics","Temperature sensors","Intelligent sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","building management systems","knowledge based systems","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven human based evolutionary knowledge base","smart buildings","life-style experiences","intelligent buildings","online learning algorithm","environmental sensing data","actuator states","fuzzified events","infrastructure components","static structures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Building Human Interaction (BHI)","Smart Buildings","Online Learning","Knowledge Base","Rule Engine"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605246","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585873/7605073/07605246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7605073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-driven human based evolutionary knowledge base for smart buildings","abstract":"This paper presents an approach to automatically create a knowledge base for smart buildings and let it dynamically evolve based on the behaviors of the occupants inside.

For this purpose, we present a procedure that selects an appropriate delta value for a given mean transmission rate. Signals are then sampled using the send-on-delta strategy with the selected delta value. The amount of sent messages will be higher in time intervals where the signal changes fast, and lower in time intervals where the signal changes slow, but maintaining the mean transmission rate and reducing, if possible, the sampling error. The procedure has been implemented for two error-based send-on-delta strategies, and tested on three step response signals. Results show that the proposed procedure decreases significantly the sampling error compared to a conformant periodic transmission strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7605250/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16409873","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Throughput analysis for error reduction in send-on-delta sampling strategies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput analysis for error reduction in send-on-delta sampling strategies","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBCCSP2016submission37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069853S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585873","isNumber":"7605073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585873","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7605073","articleId":"7605250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7605261,"authors":[{"name":"Brigitte Bidegaray-Fesquet","affiliation":["Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann, Univ.

Previous work has presented the proposed adaptive filter algorithm and has shown that the algorithm's performance is similar to that of the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. Moreover, it offers better performance than the Transform Domain (TD) algorithms, i.e. the TD LMS with Variable Step-Size (TDVSS) in stationary environments. The asynchronous logic has been chosen because of its unique low-power characteristic towards stationary events. The asynchronous-based architecture has been designed to be fast enough to accommodate the iterative computation of the filter coefficients while being accurate to ensure a minimum number of iteration, and a fast convergence. This paper presents an overview of the proposed architecture, as well as performance comparison between the RI and the RLS algorithm. Preliminary test shows promising results, nevertheless some optimization is required to reduce the complexity of the design and to increase the accuracy of the computation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous implementation of an event-driven adaptive FIR filter","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605274","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585873/7605073/07605274.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7605073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605274","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","Signal processing algorithms","Adaptive filters","Filtering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer architecture","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","convergence of numerical methods","filtering theory","FIR filters","iterative methods","recursive estimation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven adaptive FIR filter","asynchronous FIR adaptive filter","recursive inverse adaptive algorithm","recursive least squares algorithm","RLS algorithm","asynchronous logic","low-power characteristic","stationary events","asynchronous-based architecture","iterative filter coefficient computation","complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-uniform sampling and processing","low-power","Asynchronous logic","adaptive FIR filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous implementation of an event-driven adaptive FIR filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605274/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16409839","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous implementation of an event-driven adaptive FIR filter","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBCCSP2016submission63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053777S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585873","isNumber":"7605073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585873","xplore-issue":"7605073","articleId":"7605274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7605276,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard A.

By measuring the distance between input signals by means of Hermann Weyl's discrepancy norm and applying its discrete counterpart to measure the distance between event sequences, it is proven that LIF approximately preserves the metric. It turns out that in this setting, for arbitrarily small thresholds, LIF is an asymptotic isometry.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On preserving metric properties of integrate-and-fire sampling","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605276","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585873/7605073/07605276.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Second International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2016.7605276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7605073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605276","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Context","Neurons","Integrated circuit modeling","Time measurement","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","comparators (circuits)","integrating circuits","signal conditioning circuits","signal processing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preserving metric properties","integrate-and-fire sampling","leaky integrate-and-fire model","LIF","mathematical metric analysis","leaky integrator","threshold-based comparator","Hermann Weyl's discrepancy norm","asymptotic isometry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrate-and-fire sampling","discrepancy norm","isometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On preserving metric properties of integrate-and-fire sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605276/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16409855","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On preserving metric properties of integrate-and-fire sampling","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBCCSP2016submission7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058524S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585873","isNumber":"7605073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585873","xplore-issue":"7605073","articleId":"7605276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7605280,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We investigate receiver sensitivity improvements achievable using semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) or avalanche photodiodes (APDs). We analyze and simulate the impact of modulator bandwidth limitations and chirp, fiber dispersion, transient SOA gain saturation, excess shot noise, and intersymbol interference caused by the APD. Using the 4-PAM and linear equalization, an SOA with 20-dB fiber-to-fiber gain and 6-dB noise figure can improve the receiver sensitivity up to 6 dB over a thermal noise-limited receiver, whereas an APD with k\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</sub>\n = 0.18 and responsivity R = 0.74 A/W provides 4.5-dB sensitivity improvement over the same reference system. We further present a simple algorithm to optimize the intensity levels and decision thresholds for a generic non-Gaussian noise distribution, which can provide an additional sensitivity improvement of 1-2 dB. For SOAs, transient gain saturation effects cause negligible sensitivity penalties, but limit the receiver dynamic range to about 15 dB for the worst case of single-wavelength pre-amplification. For APDs, we show that the APD responsivity, impact ionization factor, low-gain bandwidth, and gain-bandwidth product are all critical parameters governing the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2016.2620139","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7733175/07605402.pdf","startPage":"5542","endPage":"5553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2016.2620139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Improvement in 100 Gb/s-per-Wavelength Links Using Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers or Avalanche Photodiodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605402/","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Improvement in 100 Gb/s-per-Wavelength Links Using Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers or Avalanche Photodiodes","volume":"34","issue":"23","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"16516112","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605402/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Maxim Integrated"},{"fundingName":"CAPES fellowship Proc.","grantNumber":"13318/13-6"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Improvement in 100 Gb/s-per-Wavelength Links Using Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers or Avalanche Photodiodes","sourcePdf":"jlt-krauseperin-2620139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095434S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7733175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7733175","articleId":"7605402","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7605406,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Vallero","affiliation":["LSI (Integrated Systems Laboratory) of EPFL (\u00c9cole Politecnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne), Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7755810/7605406/valle-2608959-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Vallero received the B.Sc. degree in physical engineering and the M.Sc. degree in nanotechnologies, both from the Polytechnic of Turin, Italy, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

The lower limit of the injection voltage is mainly enforced by the inverter nonlinearity that causes distortion of the injection voltage and degradation of the position estimation performance. After analyzing the inverter nonlinearity during the voltage injection, it is revealed that parasitic capacitances of insulated-gate bipolar transistors have positive effects on inverter output linearity and sensorless control. Based on this analysis, this paper proposes a method to reduce the injection voltage by connecting additional capacitors to the output terminals of the inverter. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed idea. In the experiments, using the capacitor-integrated inverter, it is shown that the injection voltage can be reduced by more than half without degrading the position estimation performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2620259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7886374/07605409.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2620259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7886374","startPage":"6261","endPage":"6274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Injection Voltage in Signal Injection Sensorless Drives Using a Capacitor-Integrated Inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Injection Voltage in Signal Injection Sensorless Drives Using a Capacitor-Integrated Inverter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"16773947","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7605409/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Injection Voltage in Signal Injection Sensorless Drives Using a Capacitor-Integrated Inverter","sourcePdf":"tpel-kwon-2620259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106113S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7886374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7886374","articleId":"7605409","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7605410,"authors":[{"name":"Rangarajan Jegadeesan","affiliation":["Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology (SINAPSE), Singapore","Engineering Design and Innovation Centre, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7835239/7605410/jegad-2615623-small.gif","p":["Rangarajan Jegadeesan (M\u201909) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communication engineering from the College of Engineering, Guindy, India, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, in 2014.","He was with the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, as a Product Engineer, where he focused on postsilicon characterization, and later a Systems Engineer, responsible for touch screen and low-power RF solutions.

In this paper, we present a near-field capacitive coupling (NCC)-based wireless powering scheme to transfer power to implants efficiently. By modeling the power link, we identify that the optimal operating frequency of the NCC scheme for subcutaneous power delivery is in the subGHz frequency range. The proposed scheme has desirable features, such as flexible and conformal power receiver realizations, and complies well with IEEE C95.1 specific absorption rate safety standards. The NCC link was designed and tested in a nonhuman primate cadaver, and the experimental results showed that it could safely deliver up to 100 mW of power to an implant with a peak operating efficiency of over 50%. A bending deformation study of the transmitter-receiver patches was also performed to demonstrate the reliability of the NCC powering scheme, in realistic postimplantation scenarios. Our studies validate the NCC method as a safe wireless powering scheme, which can be used as an alternative to the near-field resonant inductive coupling method, for chronic use in subcutaneous implants.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2615623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7835239/07605410.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2615623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Power Delivery to Flexible Subcutaneous Implants Using Capacitive Coupling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Power Delivery to Flexible Subcutaneous Implants Using Capacitive Coupling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605410/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16637089","htmlLink":"/document/7605410/","volume":"65","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Singapore","grantNumber":"NRF-CRP10-2012-01"},{"fundingName":"NUS Research Scholarship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Power Delivery to Flexible Subcutaneous Implants Using Capacitive Coupling","sourcePdf":"tmtt-agarwal-2615623-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091506S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7835239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7835239","articleId":"7605410","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7605445,"authors":[{"name":"Serdar Vural","affiliation":["5G Innovation Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7900486/7605445/vural-2616359-small.gif","p":["Serdar Vural received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Recently, the possibility of applying in-network data caching techniques to IoT traffic flows has been discussed in research forums. The main challenge as opposed to the typically cached content at routers, e.g., multimedia files, is that IoT data are transient and therefore require different caching policies. In fact, the emerging location-based services can also benefit from new caching techniques that are specifically designed for small transient data. This paper studies in-network caching of transient data at content routers, considering a key temporal data property: data item lifetime. An analytical model that captures the trade-off between multihop communication costs and data item freshness is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that caching transient data are a promising information-centric networking technique that can reduce the distance between content requesters and the location in the network where the content is fetched from. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering research work aiming to systematically analyze the feasibility and benefit of using Internet routers to cache transient data generated by IoT applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605445/","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7605445/","accessionNumber":"16808688","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Caching Transient Data in Internet Content Routers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching Transient Data in Internet Content Routers","sourcePdf":"tnet-vural-2616359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174827S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7900486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7900486","articleId":"7605445","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7605446,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Lu","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/7818038/7605446/lu-2620339-small.gif","p":["Yi Lu received the Bachelor of Engineering degree with First Class Honors in electronic engineering from the University of Central Lancashire, Lancashire, U.K., and the Master of Engineering degree with Distinction in electronic engineering from the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 2011 and 2012, respectively.","Currently, she is a scholarship student working toward the Ph.D. degree in nano-communications at the University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."]},"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085468326"},{"name":"Matthew D.

Furthermore, approximations of the Binomial distribution are applied to reduce the complexity of calculations. Results show the sensitivity in communication performance due to the relative location of the interfering receiver.

In conventional induction heating systems, the variation of the relative position between the heater and workpiece significantly deteriorates the heating performance. In particular, the heating effect dramatically reduces with the increase of vertical displacement or horizontal misalignment. This paper utilizes the MRC mechanism to effectuate flexible induction heating; thus, handling the requirements of varying vertical displacement and horizontal misalignment for various cooking styles. Differing from a conventional induction heating, the proposed induction heating adopts one resonant coil in the heater and one resonant coil in the workpiece, which can significantly strengthen the coupling effect, and, hence, the heating effect. Both the simulation and experimental results are given to validate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed induction heating.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2620099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2620099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849237","startPage":"1982","endPage":"1992","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7849237/07605449.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605449","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction heating","Electromagnetic heating","Couplings","Impedance","Magnetic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible induction heating","magnetic resonant coupling mechanism","MRC mechanism","vertical displacement","horizontal misalignment","resonant coil","coupling effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooking","induction heating","magnetic resonant coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Flexible Induction Heating Using Magnetic Resonant Coupling","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16668341","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7605449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605449/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003803","fundingName":"University of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"201409176054"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Induction Heating Using Magnetic Resonant Coupling","sourcePdf":"tie-chau-2620099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060889S","chronDate":"March  2017","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"53","articleId":"7605449","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7605450,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Yuan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning (OPTIMAL), Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7956367/7605450/yuan-2614548-small.gif","p":["Yuan Yuan (M\u201905\u2013SM\u201909) is a Full Professor with the School of Computer Science and Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning (OPTIMAL), Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China.

Extensive research has shown that pretty good performance can be obtained on public data sets by various state-of-the-art approaches, especially the deep learning methods. However, deep learning methods require extensive computing resources. In addition, these approaches mostly concentrate on single image detection and recognition task, which is not applicable in real-world applications. Different from previous research, we introduce a unified incremental computational framework for traffic sign detection, tracking, and recognition task using the mono-camera mounted on a moving vehicle under non-stationary environments. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) to enhance detection performance by utilizing the contextual information, this paper innovatively utilizes the spatial distribution prior of the traffic signs; (2) to improve the tracking performance and localization accuracy under non-stationary environments, a new efficient incremental framework containing off-line detector, online detector, and motion model predictor together is designed for traffic sign detection and tracking simultaneously; and (3) to get a more stable classification output, a scale-based intra-frame fusion method is proposed. We evaluate our method on two public data sets and the performance has shown that the proposed system can obtain results comparable with the deep learning method with less computing resource in a near-real-time manner.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2016.2614548","startPage":"1918","endPage":"1929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2016.2614548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7956367","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7956367/07605450.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Incremental Framework for Video-Based Traffic Sign Detection, Tracking, and Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605450/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Incremental Framework for Video-Based Traffic Sign Detection, Tracking, and Recognition","volume":"18","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7605450/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16969438","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379094"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation Research Project of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015JM6264"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102015BJ(II)JJZ01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Incremental Framework for Video-Based Traffic Sign Detection, Tracking, and Recognition","sourcePdf":"tits-wangguesteditorsirobusteffi-2614548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095864S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7956367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7956367","articleId":"7605450","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":7605454,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Chen","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-2834-7455","id":"37085620208"},{"name":"Ling Qiu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37279946000"},{"name":"Xiao Wen Liang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiao Wen","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085433072"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7605454","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":637},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605454","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","MIMO","Stochastic processes","Geometry","Transmitting antennas","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","cellular radio","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area spectral efficiency analysis","multiantenna two-tier cellular network","ASE","multiantenna base station","tractable approximation","single-antenna network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Area spectral efficiency","heterogeneous networks","multi-user MIMO","stochastic geometry"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates the area spectral efficiency (ASE) of a two-tier network with multi-antenna base stations (BSs).

For low-voltage dc grids, switching devices are needed that have to meet technically sophisticated requirements. These devices have to handle fault currents of several hundred amperes and system voltages up to 1000 V. A typical dc circuit breaker has to provide low on-state losses, light weight, and small volume. On the way toward fulfilling these requirements, hybrid circuit breakers can represent the optimal solution. A hybrid dc circuit breaker combines the advantages of mechanical contacts and semiconductors. In this paper, such a device has been designed and constructed using a commercial switch and electronic components in the laboratory. The breaking performance of this experimental prototype has been investigated, and thus the interruption of the nominal and failure currents in the case of different time constants can be identified. The investigated hybrid switching device has been optimized in order to maximize the switching capacity and the protection of the semiconductors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid DC Circuit Breaker Feasibility Study","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2613579","startPage":"354","endPage":"362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2613579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7878697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7878697/07605456.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid DC Circuit Breaker Feasibility Study","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7605456/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16759861","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid DC Circuit Breaker Feasibility Study","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-boesche-2613579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062542S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7878697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7878697","articleId":"7605456","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7605459,"authors":[{"name":"Oguzhan Teke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7748608/7605459/teke-2620111-small.gif","p":["Oguzhan Teke (S\u201912) received the B.S. and the M.S. degree in\n electrical and electronics engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey, in 2012, and 2014, respectively.

The behavior of such graph filter banks differs from that of classical filter banks in many ways, the precise details depending on the eigenstructure of the adjacency matrix A. It is shown that graph filter banks represent, (linear and) periodically, shift-variant systems only when A satisfies the noble identity conditions developed in Part I. It is then shown that perfect reconstruction graph filter banks can always be developed when A satisfies the eigenvector structure satisfied by M-block cyclic graphs and has distinct eigenvalues (further restrictions on eigenvalues being unnecessary for this). If A is actually M-block cyclic then these PR filter banks indeed become practical, i.e., arbitrary filter polynomial orders are possible, and there are robustness advantages. In this case, the PR condition is identical to PR in classical filter banks-any classical PR example can be converted to a graph PR filter bank on an M-block cyclic graph. It is shown that for M-block cyclic graphs with all eigenvalues on the unit circle, the frequency responses of filters have meaningful correspondence with classical filter banks. Polyphase representations are then developed for graph filter banks and utilized to develop alternate conditions for alias cancellation and perfect reconstruction, again for graphs with specific eigenstructures. It is then shown that the eigenvector condition on the graph can be relaxed by using similarity transforms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2620111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7748608/07605459.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2620111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending Classical Multirate Signal Processing Theory to Graphs\u2014Part II: M-Channel Filter Banks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605459","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7748608/7605459-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605459/","displayDocTitle":"Extending Classical Multirate Signal Processing Theory to Graphs\u2014Part II: M-Channel Filter Banks","volume":"65","issue":"2","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16482185","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605459/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-11-1-0676 and N00014-15-1-2118"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006961","fundingName":"California Institute of Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Extending Classical Multirate Signal Processing Theory to Graphs\u2014Part II: M-Channel Filter Banks","sourcePdf":"tsp-teke-2620111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097624S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7748608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7748608","articleId":"7605459","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7605460,"authors":[{"name":"Manav R.

Based on this passive dynamics of human locomotion, we develop an energy-efficient braking torque controller for a robotic transtibial prosthesis. The controller first generates motor current/torque from human locomotion instead of the battery energy, and then controls the current/torque with alternating current sensing and voltage-controlled-resistor. On the basis of the low-level motor torque controller, we then propose the impedance model that determines the desired joint torque according to the joint angle and joint velocity, the prosthesis model that converts the desired ankle joint torque to desired motor torque, and the friction model that estimates the friction torque and compensates the joint torque. Step response and frequency response show that the low-level controller can reach the desired torque value within 0.07 s, and has a $-$3 $\\text{dB}$ bandwidth of 25.2 $\\text{Hz}$. Experiments of level-ground treadmill walking with three amputees show that the prosthesis with the proposed controller can effectively mimic the normal ankle performance and bring the amputees a natural gait pattern with low power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2016.2620166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2016.2620166","startPage":"149","endPage":"160","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7855861/07605473.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Braking Torque Control of Robotic Transtibial Prosthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Braking Torque Control of Robotic Transtibial Prosthesis","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605473/","accessionNumber":"16669205","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605473/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61005082, 61020106005 and 61533001"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Disabled Persons"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z141101001814001"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"Z151100003715001 and Z151100000915073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Braking Torque Control of Robotic Transtibial Prosthesis","sourcePdf":"tmech-wang-2620166-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103074S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7855861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7855861","articleId":"7605473","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7605477,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7782442/7605477/wang-2620279-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in information countermeasure technology and the M.S. degree in signal and information processing from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

The NU and Bob require normal and secure data transmissions, respectively, and thus, the stream for the NU can be exploited to confuse the eavesdroppers. To guarantee the security of Bob, artificial noise (AN) is also deliberately injected into the null space of Bob and NU. The power allocation among Bob, NU, and AN, as well as the wiretap code rates, is jointly optimized to maximize the effective secrecy throughput (EST), under the average throughput constraint of the NU and statistical channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers. Both non-adaptive and adaptive transmission schemes are proposed, based on the statistical and instantaneous CSI of the legitimate channels, respectively. An alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal parameters. It is proved that the EST is a quasi-concave function of the secrecy rate and the power allocated to Bob, and for fixed wiretap code rates, the optimal power allocation is derived in a closed-form expression. Numerical results show that the EST increases with the increase in transmitting power and the number of transmit antennas, and decreases with the increasing throughput constraint of the NU. Improved EST can be achieved through injecting AN and concurrent transmission of Bob and NU.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2016.2620279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7782442/07605477.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7782442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2620279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Throughput Maximization for MISO Multi-Eavesdropper Wiretap Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Throughput Maximization for MISO Multi-Eavesdropper Wiretap Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605477/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16562106","htmlLink":"/document/7605477/","volume":"12","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Throughput Maximization for MISO Multi-Eavesdropper Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"tifs-li-2620279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110717S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7782442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7782442","articleId":"7605477","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7605493,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Zhai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computing and Mathematics, University of Derby, Derby, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7605493/zhai-2619181-small.gif","p":["Xiaojun Zhai received the B.Sc. degree from the North China University of Technology, China, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree in embedded intelligent systems and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Hertfordshire, U.K., in 2009 and 2013, respectively.

Since the reliability of sensors is very important in those systems, gas classification is a critical process within the gas safety precautions. A gas classification system has to react fast in order to take essential actions in the case of fault detection. This paper proposes a low latency real-time gas classification service system, which uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network to detect and classify the gas sensor data. An accurate MLP is developed to work with the data set obtained from an array of tin oxide (SnO2) gas sensor, based on convex micro hotplates. The overall system acquires the gas sensor data through radio-frequency identification (RFID), and processes the sensor data with the proposed MLP classifier implemented on a system on chip (SoC) platform from Xilinx. Hardware implementation of the classifier is optimized to achieve very low latency for real-time application. The proposed architecture has been implemented on a ZYNQ SoC using fixed-point format and the achieved results have shown that an accuracy of 97.4% has been obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2619181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07605493.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2619181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","startPage":"8138","endPage":"8146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MLP Neural Network Based Gas Classification System on Zynq SoC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605493","topic":"Cooperative and Intelligent Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MLP Neural Network Based Gas Classification System on Zynq SoC","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605493/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16568333","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7605493/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) grant No. 5 \u2013 080 \u2013 2 \u2013 028 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"MLP Neural Network Based Gas Classification System on Zynq SoC","sourcePdf":"access-zhai-2619181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063468S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Cooperative and Intelligent Sensing"],"articleId":"7605493","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7605494,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Naghshin","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7818052/7605494/naghs-2619710-small.gif","p":["Vahid Naghshin (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Isfahan, Isfahan, and the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

The spatial locations of base stations (BSs) as well as user equipments (UEs) are modeled as independent spatial homogeneous Poisson point processes. The decoupled association is evaluated where the UE may connect to different BSs in the UL and DL transmissions. Unlike most of the existing works, the packet transmission slots are not synchronized, that is, the starting and ending points of the slots are not aligned. We investigate fundamental performance metrics of dynamic packet HCN for two traffic models, namely, the slotted-asynchronous and exponential-interarrival. Furthermore, tight lower bounds for the DL and UL coverage probabilities for two traffic models are obtained. The derived bounds are tight especially in high data rate regimes. The analysis provided herein enables us to determine the performance limits of packet-based HCNs with possible asynchronous time-slots. Simulation results are conducted to verify the analytical derivations. Furthermore, the performance comparison between pure synchronous and asynchronous packet-based systems is provided. The results confirm that the synchronous case outperforms the asynchronous one in terms of the UL and DL coverage probabilities at the cost of higher computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2619710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2619710","startPage":"200","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07605494.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage Analysis of Packet Multi-Tier Networks With Asynchronous Slots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Coverage Analysis of Packet Multi-Tier Networks With Asynchronous Slots","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598306","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7605494/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Councils Discovery Projects funding scheme","grantNumber":"DP130101760"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage Analysis of Packet Multi-Tier Networks With Asynchronous Slots","sourcePdf":"tcomm-naghshin-2619710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119645S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7605494","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7605496,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Yuan Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7782442/7605496/liu-2620281-small.gif","p":["Ta-Yuan Liu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communications engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2009 and 2015, respectively.

In particular, AN in the training phase is used to prevent the eavesdropper from obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI), whereas AN in the data transmission phase can be used to mask the transmission of confidential messages. By considering AN-assisted training and secrecy beamforming, we first derive bounds on the achievable secrecy rate and utilize them to obtain approximate secrecy rate expressions that are asymptotically tight at high SNR. By maximizing these expressions, power allocation policies between signal and AN in both training and data transmission phases are then proposed for conventional and AN-assisted training-based schemes, respectively. We show that the optimal AN power at high SNR should be non-vanishing with respect to the total power, and that AN usage can be more effective in the training phase than in the data transmission phase when the coherence time is large. However, at low SNR, we show that AN cannot be effectively utilized due to the lack of accurate CSI, and thus, one can often do better without. Numerical results are presented to verify our theoretical claims.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7782442/07605496.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2016.2620281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2620281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7782442","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Role of Artificial Noise in Training and Data Transmission for Secret Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Channel estimation","Data communication","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Resource management","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial noise","data transmission","physical-layer secret communications","channel state information","secrecy beamforming","AN-assisted training-based schemes","channel estimation","closed-form approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secrecy","wiretap channel","channel estimation","artificial noise","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the Role of Artificial Noise in Training and Data Transmission for Secret Communications","volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7605496/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16562104","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"104-2628-E-011-008-MY3, 105-2221-E-007-019-MY3 and 105-2218-E-007-010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Role of Artificial Noise in Training and Data Transmission for Secret Communications","sourcePdf":"tifs-hong-2620281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140307S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7782442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7782442","articleId":"7605496","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7605497,"authors":[{"name":"Guozheng Li","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7849237/7605497/li-2620103-small.gif","p":["Guozheng Li received the B.S. degree in detection techniques and\n instrumentation from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in safety technology\n and engineering from the School of Mechanical, Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, in\n 2014.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in power electronics in the School of Electric Power, South China\n University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

Two synchronization systems are constructed to implement this method, in which one is used to estimate the frequency and phase angle, the other is used to estimate the amplitude. The detection process is achieved in three steps. First, two synchronization systems are established based on chaotic synchronization theorem and adaptive algorithm. The test signal is injected into their driving ends. Second, in the first synchronization system, the frequency of the sinusoidal signal is obtained by the MUSIC algorithm. Then, the reference sinusoidal signal with this frequency can be generated and correlated with the test signal. The phase difference between them is obtained. Finally, in the second synchronization system, the amplitude of the reference signal is close to the actual amplitude of the sinusoidal signal in the process of synchronization. This detection system is achieved by the Chua's circuit, and its detection characteristics are verified by simulation and experimentation. The results show that it is feasible to obtain the parameters of the sinusoidal signal. It retains excellent detection performance, simplifies parameters setting, avoids the solution of the running state, and is easy to achieve.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2620103","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2620103","startPage":"2255","endPage":"2265","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7849237/07605497.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605497/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Weak Signal Detection Method via Chaotic Synchronization Using Chua's Circuit","volume":"64","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16668329","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7605497/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51505154"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51437005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Weak Signal Detection Method via Chaotic Synchronization Using Chua's Circuit","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2620103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077581S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7605497","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":7605501,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Romero","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Digital Technology Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7753033/7605501/romer-2620116-small.gif","p":["Daniel\u00a0Romero (M'16) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees\n from the University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2011 and 2015, respectively.

In this context, graph signals are widely encountered as descriptors of vertex attributes or features in graph-structured data. Estimating such signals in all vertices given noisy observations of their values on a subset of vertices has been extensively analyzed in the literature of signal processing on graphs (SPoG). This paper advocates kernel regression as a framework generalizing popular SPoG modeling and reconstruction and expanding their capabilities. Formulating signal reconstruction as a regression task on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of graph signals permeates benefits from statistical learning, offers fresh insights, and allows for estimators that leverage richer forms of prior information than existing alternatives. A number of SPoG notions such as bandlimitedness, graph filters, and the graph Fourier transform are naturally accommodated in the kernel framework. Additionally, this paper capitalizes on the so-called representer theorem to devise simpler versions of existing Tikhonov regularized estimators, and offers a novel probabilistic interpretation of kernel methods on graphs based on graphical models. Motivated by the challenges of selecting the bandwidth parameter in SPoG estimators or the kernel map in kernel-based methods, this paper further proposes two multikernel approaches with complementary strengths. Whereas the first enables estimation of the unknown bandwidth of bandlimited signals, the second allows for efficient graph filter selection. Numerical tests with synthetic as well as real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods relative to state-of-the-art alternatives.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2620116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7753033/07605501.pdf","startPage":"764","endPage":"778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2620116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel-Based Reconstruction of Graph Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605501","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7753033/7605501-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Kernel-Based Reconstruction of Graph Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605501/","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16486376","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605501/","volume":"65","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"ARO","grantNumber":"W911NF-15-1-0492"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1343248, 1442686 and 1514056"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Kernel-Based Reconstruction of Graph Signals","sourcePdf":"tsp-giannakis-2620116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121125S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7753033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"7753033","articleId":"7605501","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7605507,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Lo Schiavo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell\u2019Informazione, Seconda Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli, Aversa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7747553/7605507/lo-2620149-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Lo Schiavo (M\u201999) was born in Naples, Italy, in 1972.

Unlike the usual energy-harvesting WSNs, here it is proposed to supply not only the sensor nodes but also the sink node by means of an energy harvester, in order to realize independent networks for each wagon. This choice allows the overcoming of several issues related to a single network for the whole train, but it requires a significant reduction of the energy consumption of the power-hungry sink node. In order to reduce the energy consumption to values sustainable by energy harvesters without penalizing the quality of service, this paper proposes a bi-periodic communication scheme for the local wireless transmission, a dynamic management of the GPS receiver, and a consumption model of the GPRS transceiver, which allows an optimized management of the sleep modes. The proposed solutions are compared with the existing ones, and the theoretical predictions are validated by measurements on a system prototype under different operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605507/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","volume":"16","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16466504","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7605507/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fully Autonomous Wireless Sensor Network for Freight Wagon Monitoring","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione, dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Autonomous Wireless Sensor Network for Freight Wagon Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jsen-loschiavo-2620149-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063478S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7747553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7747553","articleId":"7605507","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7605511,"authors":[{"name":"Licheng Zhao","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7748608/7605511/zhao-2620113-small.gif","p":["Licheng Zhao received the B.S. degree in information engineering from\n Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

We optimize a unified metric over a general constraint set. The unified metric includes the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and the peak sidelobe level (PSL) as special cases, and the general constraint set contains the unimodular constraint, Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR) constraint, and similarity constraint, to name a few. The optimization technique we employ is the majorization-minimization (MM) method, which is iterative and enjoys guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. We carry out the MM method in two stages: in the majorization stage, we propose three majorizing functions: two for the unified metric and one for the ISL metric; in the minimization stage, we give closed-form solutions for algorithmic updates under different constraints. The update step can be implemented with a few Fast Fourier Transformations (FFTs) and/or Inverse FFTs (IFFTs). We also show the connections between the MM and gradient projection method under our algorithmic scheme. Numerical simulations have shown that the proposed MM-based algorithms can produce sequences with low autocorrelation and converge faster than the traditional gradient projection method and the state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2620113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7748608/07605511.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2620113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Framework for Low Autocorrelation Sequence Design via Majorization\u2013Minimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605511/","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Framework for Low Autocorrelation Sequence Design via Majorization\u2013Minimization","volume":"65","issue":"2","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16466511","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605511/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC","grantNumber":"16206315"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC Theme-based Research Scheme (TRS)","grantNumber":"T21-602/15R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Framework for Low Autocorrelation Sequence Design via Majorization\u2013Minimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhao-2620113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.194354S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7748608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7748608","articleId":"7605511","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7605512,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanxin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7748608/7605512/li-2620109-small.gif","p":["Yuanxin Li (S\u201912) received the B.Eng. degree from Nanjing\n University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2010, the first M.S. degree from Tsinghua University,\n Beijing, China, in 2013, and the second M.S. degree from The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA, in 2016.

The advantage of our algorithm is that it is free of parameters, therefore, eliminating the need for tuning parameters and allowing easy implementations. We establish that with high probability, a low-rank PSD matrix can be exactly recovered as soon as the number of measurements is large enough, even when a fraction of the measurements are corrupted by outliers with arbitrary magnitudes. Moreover, the recovery is also stable against bounded noise. With the additional information of an upper bound of the rank of the PSD matrix, we propose another nonconvex algorithm based on subgradient descent that demonstrates excellent empirical performance in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7748608/7605512-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16466514","htmlLink":"/document/7605512/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-Rank Positive Semidefinite Matrix Recovery From Corrupted Rank-One Measurements","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1422966 and ECCS-1462191"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"AFOSR","grantNumber":"FA9550-15-1-0205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Low-Rank Positive Semidefinite Matrix Recovery From Corrupted Rank-One Measurements","sourcePdf":"tsp-chi-2620109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106093S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7748608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7748608","articleId":"7605512","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7605513,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Hsun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Hsun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085901009"},{"name":"Hwann-Kaeo Chiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hwann-Kaeo","lastName":"Chiou","id":"37270829800"},{"name":"Yuan-Chang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Chang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085418185"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7605513","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1343},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["K-band","Power amplifiers","Impedance","Circuit faults","Impedance matching","Broadband communication","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","impedance matching","MMIC power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-band PAE wideband unilateralized CMOS power amplifier","differential transmission-line transformers","intrinsic gate-drain feedback effect","reverse isolation","power gain","three-differential-stage amplifier","low-loss transmission-line transformers","TLT","input-output impedance matching networks","inter-stage coupling","power added efficiency","efficiency 24.1 percent","size 0.18 mum","frequency 18.8 GHz to 23.3 GHz","gain 26.2 dB","power 440 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS differential power amplifier","transmission line transformer","unilateralization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605513","abstract":"This letter presents a K-band CMOS power amplifier that adopted a unilateralized technique to mitigate the intrinsic gate-drain feedback effect of the transistor for increasing the reverse isolation and power gain.

accurate characterization of Single Event Transient (SET) propagation in SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs): both generation and measurement of SETs are implemented on chip,

The scheme we developed is mainly based on two circuits: 1) the one is a SET generating circuit for on-chip producing an adjustable pulse with a temporal resolution of near 100 ps; 2) the other is a SET measuring circuit for on-chip measuring pulses with a temporal resolution of near 80 ps and the ability to detect narrow transient pulses of about 300 ps. Based on above methodology, we investigate the effect of traversing seven logic chains with different gate types and multiple chain lengths on pulse widths, i.e., Propagation Induced Pulse Distorting (PIPD). Results demonstrate, when SETs propagate along Look Up Tables (LUTs) in Virtex-6 FPGAs, there is a broadening for negative SETs (1-0-1) while not for positive SETs (0-1-0); in addition, pulse width has no impact on PIPD, and which is linearly proportional to the number of stages.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2620165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7779982/07605515.pdf","startPage":"2985","endPage":"2992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2620165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology for Characterization of SET Propagation in SRAM-Based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605515/","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology for Characterization of SET Propagation in SRAM-Based FPGAs","volume":"63","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7605515/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16561817","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61274036, 61371025, 61474036, 61574052 and 61674048"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology for Characterization of SET Propagation in SRAM-Based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tns-xu-2620165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074479S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7779982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7779982","articleId":"7605515","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7605521,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Min Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7753033/7605521/lin-2620105-small.gif","p":["Yu-Min Lin (S'14) received the B.S. degree in electrical\n engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011.

The reconstruction of sparse signals in CS is an underdetermined problem. For realistic applications, the sparsity information may not be available, the measurements are used to be disturbed by noise, and efficient hardware realization is important. Existing CS reconstruction algorithms are tradeoff between noise tolerance and low complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction algorithm called stochastic gradient pursuit (SGP). The stochastic gradient approach is applied to replace least square process of well-known orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Since stochastic gradient approach iterates toward a minimum mean square error solution, proposed algorithm shows robustness against noise. Furthermore, proposed algorithm inherits the low-complexity property of OMP and shows feasibility of hardware implementation. The SGP algorithm can achieve 36% higher success rate as well as 27% less complexity than OMP when SNR is 20 dB. Finally, we implement the algorithm with designed hardware sharing architecture in TSMC 90 nm technology.

Each tunable delay line is implemented by a Mach-Zehnder delay interferometer with tunable coupling ratio, which allows varying the delay from 0 up to the delay of the interferometer. Self-heterodyne coherent detection allows achieving maximum sensitivity inherent to coherent detection, and also laser phase noise cancellation, photonic RF phase shifting, and photonic RF frequency downconversion. The proposed system is analytically described and numerically validated. Numerical results show that, considering a beamsteering range of \u00b130\u00b0, the system is able to beamform the signals received by N antenna elements with negligible distortion, thereby proving to be very promising for high-end phased array antenna receivers operating at high RF frequencies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2016.2620146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733175","startPage":"5566","endPage":"5575","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7733175/07605531.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonic True-Time-Delay Beamformer for a Phased Array Antenna Receiver based on Self-Heterodyne Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7605531/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Photonic True-Time-Delay Beamformer for a Phased Array Antenna Receiver based on Self-Heterodyne Detection","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"16516096","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"23","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia/Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ci\u00eancia through national funds"},{"fundingName":"Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional \u2013 Portugal 2020 partnership agreement","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"BEACON","grantNumber":"FP7-SPACE-2013-1-607401"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonic True-Time-Delay Beamformer for a Phased Array Antenna Receiver based on Self-Heterodyne Detection","sourcePdf":"jlt-duarte-2620146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100507S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7733175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7733175","articleId":"7605531","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7605533,"authors":[{"name":"Yinghao Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7818052/7605533/guo-2620164-small.gif","p":["Yinghao Guo (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic and information engineering from the Dalian University of Technology in 2012.

In particular, the MTs first cache in their local memories in off-peak hours and then exchange the requested files with each other in the vicinity during peak hours. However, prior works largely overlook MTs' heterogeneity in file preferences and their selfish behaviors. In this paper, we practically categorize the MTs into different interest groups according to the MTs' preferences. Each group of MTs aims to increase the probability of successful file discovery from the neighboring MTs (from the same or different groups). Hence, we define the groups' utilities as the probability of successfully discovering the file in the neighboring MTs, which should be maximized by deciding the caching strategies of different groups. By modeling MTs' mobilities as homogeneous Poisson point processes, we analytically characterize MTs' utilities in the closed form. We first consider the fully cooperative case where a centralizer helps all groups to make caching decisions. We formulate the problem as a weighted-sum utility maximization problem, through which the maximum utility tradeoffs of different groups are characterized. Next, we study two benchmark cases under selfish caching, namely, partial and no cooperation, with and without inter-group file sharing, respectively. The optimal caching distributions for these two cases are derived. Finally, numerical examples are presented to compare the utilities under different cases and show the effectiveness of the fully cooperative local caching compared with the two benchmark cases.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2620164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2620164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07605533.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Local Caching Under Heterogeneous File Preferences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Local Caching Under Heterogeneous File Preferences","volume":"65","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7605533/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16598295","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605533/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001352","fundingName":"National University of Singapore Research","grantNumber":"R263-000-B46-112"},{"fundingName":"MOE Academic Research Fund Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2016-T2-1-173"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Local Caching Under Heterogeneous File Preferences","sourcePdf":"tcomm-guo-2620164-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11835S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7605533","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7605537,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Qi","affiliation":["Tsinghua Space Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Qi","orcid":"0000-0001-9086-5064","id":"37085708626"},{"name":"Wei Feng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Feng","orcid":"0000-0001-5147-2145","id":"37086038531"},{"name":"Youzheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua Space Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youzheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086035011"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7605537","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":759},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7605537","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Complexity theory","Signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Parity check codes","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonorthogonal multiple access","sparsity maximization perspective","multiuser system","signal processing","message passing algorithm","construction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","optimal sparsity","sequences design","sum capacity"]}],"abstract":"Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can improve the spectral efficiency of a multi-user system by enabling overload usage of radio resources. To eliminate the multiple access interference, the NOMA usually requires complicated signal processing, which may hinder its practical applications. One promising solution is to design sparse multiple access sequences for the NOMA, and then leverage the message passing algorithm to reduce the detection complexity. However, the optimal sequences for the NOMA that can achieve both the maximum sum rate and the maximum sparsity are still unknown. In this letter, the optimal sparsity of sum capacity-achievable NOMA sequences is theoretically given under the condition that the system load is not smaller than 2. To achieve the optimal sparsity, a construction method is further proposed by adopting the frame theory. The simulation results show that the constructed sequences have better sparsity compared with other sum capacity-achieving ones, and also higher sum rate compared with other sparse sequences.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2620158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2620158","startPage":"636","endPage":"639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07605537.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Sequences for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: A Sparsity Maximization Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Sequences for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: A Sparsity Maximization Perspective","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723192","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7605537/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61231011 and 61132002"},{"fundingName":"NatuNational Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Sequences for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: A Sparsity Maximization Perspective","sourcePdf":"lcomm-feng-2620158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072185S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7605537","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7605542,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7951135/7605542/guo-2619480-small.gif","p":["Jie Guo received the B.S and M.S. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2005 and 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in 2016.","She has three-year industry experience in solid state disk development.

Consequently, conventional error correction code is not adequate to guarantee system reliability. As an alternative, low density parity check (LDPC) code is introduced to provide more powerful error correction capability. However, to achieve better performance, LDPC code demands extra memory sensing operations and more data transfer cycles, directly leading to longer read latency. To achieve both system reliability and read efficiency, we propose the FlexLevel NAND flash storage system design in this paper. FlexLevel consists of two levels of optimization: 1) LevelAdjust and 2) AccessEval. At device level, the LevelAdjust technique is proposed to reduce BER by broadening noise margin via threshold voltage level reduction. With LevelAdjust, BER is greatly reduced and no extra sensing levels are required to protect data integrity. Hence, read performance is improved. However, while LevelAdjust can improve system reliability and read performance, it causes density loss. To balance read performance improvement and density loss, we propose the AccessEval technique at system level. AccessEval identifies data with high LDPC overhead and only applies LevelAdjust technique to these data. The experimental results show that compared with the best existing works, the proposed design can achieve up to 11% read speedup with negligible density loss.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2016.2619480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2619480","startPage":"1167","endPage":"1180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7951135/07605542.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FlexLevel NAND Flash Storage System Design to Reduce LDPC Latency","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/7951135/7605542-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"FlexLevel NAND Flash Storage System Design to Reduce LDPC Latency","volume":"36","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16970059","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7605542/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"NSF CNS-1253424 and NSF ECCS-1202225"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61472322 and 61272122"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"3102014JSJ0001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"FlexLevel NAND Flash Storage System Design to Reduce LDPC Latency","sourcePdf":"tcad-guo-2619480-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158412S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7951135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7951135","articleId":"7605542","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7605554,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Kumar Meher","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7835743/7605554/meher-2614309-small.gif","p":["Pramod Kumar Meher (SM\u201903) received the B.Sc.

We have derived a recursive algorithm for the multiplication, and used that to design a regular and localized bit-level dependence graph (DG) for systolic computation. The bit-level regular DG is converted into a fine-grained DG by node-splitting, and mapped that into a parallel systolic architecture. Unlike most of the existing structures, it does not involve any global communications for modular reduction. The proposed bit-parallel systolic structure has the same cycle time as that of the best existing bit-parallel systolic structure, but involves significantly less number of registers.

This paper presents a microwave-based measurement technique for detection of dielectric objects in powder materials flowing through metal pipes. A nonintrusive microwave sensor is developed, which uses multiple resonant modes to obtain high sensitivity with respect to permittivity variations inside the pipe. Undesirable objects are detected based on the scattering parameters of the sensor, which are measured using a fast-sampling microwave transmitter and receiver unit. We present a detection algorithm derived from the likelihood-ratio test, which includes a parametric model of the local statistical distribution of the measured scattering parameter data. The model involves a set of M\u00f6bius transformations that map the measured scattering parameters to a domain where the data are Gaussian distributed. All unknown parameters in the model are estimated from data using maximum likelihood. Based on measurement results from a gravity-fall experimental setup, we conclude that small dielectric objects can be reliably detected in heterogeneous flows of dielectric powder.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7605557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 October 2016","volume":"64","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"16427795","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7605557/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Measurement System for Detection of Dielectric Objects in Powders","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA via a Project within the VINN Excellence Center CHASE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Measurement System for Detection of Dielectric Objects in Powders","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nohlert-2613047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072242S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7733167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7733167","articleId":"7605557","onlineDate":"21 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7606792,"authors":[{"name":"Ziv Goldfeld","affiliation":["Ben Gurion University of the Negev"],"firstName":"Ziv","lastName":"Goldfeld","id":"38469121800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1090-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1091-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606792","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receivers","Matrix decomposition","Covariance matrices","Conferences","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","encoding","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-user multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian broadcast channel","MIMO Gaussian broadcast channels","secrecy-capacity region","dirty-paper coding","DPC"]}],"abstract":"The two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) with common, private and confidential messages is considered.

Although we focus on coding for sake of coherence with our previous results, the framework and methods are very general and hold for a wide class of generalized estimation problems with random linear mixing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606799","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606799.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"80","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold saturation of spatially coupled sparse superposition codes for all memoryless channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Threshold saturation of spatially coupled sparse superposition codes for all memoryless channels","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7606799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424575","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606799/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold saturation of spatially coupled sparse superposition codes for all memoryless channels","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p76-barbier.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048519S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7606802,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Adding a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) to better protect information on the semi-polarized channels has already been successfully applied in the literature, and is straightforward to be used in combination with Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding. Belief Propagation (BP) decoding, however, offers more potential for exploiting parallelism in hardware implementation, and thus, we focus our attention on improving the BP decoder. Specifically, similar to the CRC strategy in the SCL-case, we use a short-length \u201cauxiliary\u201d LDPC code together with the polar code to provide a significant improvement in terms of BER.

Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) initiated a fundamental study of caching systems by proposing a scheme (with uncoded cache placement and linear network coding delivery) that is provably optimal to within a factor 4.7. In this paper, when the cache contents and the user demands are fixed, we connect the caching problem to an index coding problem and show the optimality of the MAN scheme under the conditions that (i) the cache placement phase is restricted to be uncoded (i.e, pieces of the files can only copied into the user's cache), and (ii) the number of users is no more than the number of files. As a consequence, further improvements to the MAN scheme are only possible through the use of coded cache placement.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Encoding","Servers","Conferences","Network coding","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","network coding","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncoded cache placement optimality","peak-hour network traffic congestion reduction","local cache","Maddah-Ali and Niesen scheme","MAN scheme","caching systems","linear network coding delivery","cache contents","user demands","index coding problem","cache placement phase","coded cache placement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606816","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606816","startPage":"161","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606816.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606816/","displayDocTitle":"On the optimality of uncoded cache placement","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16424515","htmlLink":"/document/7606816/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the optimality of uncoded cache placement","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p161-wan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048145S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7606818,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Mohammad Mohammadi","lastName":"Amiri","id":"37085896072"},{"name":"Qianqian Yang","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Qianqian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085884982"},{"name":"Deniz G\u00fcnd\u00fcz","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Deniz","lastName":"G\u00fcnd\u00fcz","id":"37284016000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1090-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1091-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606818","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":680},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606818","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Databases","Information theory","Conferences","Cache memory","Multicast communication","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","file servers","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded caching","central file server","user caches","delivery phase","error-free common link","local cache memories","centralized caching problem","group-based coded caching scheme","decentralized delivery rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coding","centralized coded caching","decentralized coded caching"]}],"abstract":"We consider the coded caching problem with a central server containing N files, each of length F bits, and K users, each equipped with a cache of capacity MF bits. We assume that coded contents can be proactively placed into users' caches at no cost during the placement phase. During the delivery phase, each user requests exactly one file from the database, and all the requests are served simultaneously by the server over an error-free common link. The goal is to utilize the local cache memories at the users to reduce the delivery rate from the server during the peak period. Here, we focus on a system which has more users than files, i.e., K > N. We first consider the centralized caching problem, in which the number and identity of active users are known in advance, and propose a group-based coded caching scheme for M = N/K, which improves upon the best achievable scheme in the literature. The proposed centralized caching scheme is then exploited in a decentralized setting, in which neither the number nor the identity of the active users are known during the placement phase. It is shown that the proposed coded caching scheme improves upon the best known decentralized delivery rate as well.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606818","startPage":"171","endPage":"175","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606818.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded caching for a large number of users","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606818/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Coded caching for a large number of users","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16413400","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7606818/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded caching for a large number of users","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p171-mohammadi_amiri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057354S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7606822,"authors":[{"name":"Keerthi Suria Kumar Arumugam","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"firstName":"Keerthi Suria Kumar","lastName":"Arumugam","id":"37085903834"},{"name":"Matthieu R.

Previous studies of SC-LDPC have focused on the bit error rate (BER) performance or the frame error rate (FER) performance over the entire length of the code. Here, we consider protograph-based constructions of SC-LDPC codes in which a window decoder continuously outputs blocks in a streaming fashion, and we examine the BLER associated with these blocks. We begin by examining the effect of protograph design on the streaming BLER by varying the block size and the coupling width in such a way that the overall constraint length of the SC-LDPC code remains constant. Next, we investigate the BLER scaling behavior with block size and coupling width. Lastly, we consider the effect of employing an outer code to protect blocks, so that small numbers of residual errors can be corrected by the outer code. Simulation results for the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC) are included and comparisons are made to LDPC block codes (LDPC-BCs).","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606831","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606831.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the block error rate performance of spatially coupled LDPC codes for streaming applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the block error rate performance of spatially coupled LDPC codes for streaming applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606831/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16424526","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7606831/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the block error rate performance of spatially coupled LDPC codes for streaming applications","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p236-mitchell.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082048S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7606833,"authors":[{"name":"Rafah El-Khatib","affiliation":["LTHC, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Rafah","lastName":"El-Khatib","id":"37085907281"},{"name":"Nicolas Macris","affiliation":["LTHC, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Macris","id":"37563656600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1090-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1091-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606833","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"abstract":"We consider spatially coupled systems governed by a set of scalar density evolution equations.

We illustrate the formula with two applications, namely Generalized LDPC codes and compressive sensing.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Couplings","Compressed sensing","Context","Transient analysis","Boundary conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","iterative methods","message passing","parity check codes","wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wave propagating velocity","general coupled scalar system","scalar density evolution equation","message-passing algorithm","coding","sparse sensing","constraint-satisfaction problem","solitonic wave-like behavior","initial transient iteration","generalized LDPC code","compressive sensing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606833","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606833.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The velocity of the propagating wave for general coupled scalar systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The velocity of the propagating wave for general coupled scalar systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606833/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7606833/","accessionNumber":"16424591","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The velocity of the propagating wave for general coupled scalar systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p246-el-khatib.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087531S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7606837,"authors":[{"name":"Eric W.

For sensing matrices with independent identically distributed (IID) Gaussian entries, the performance of AMP can be asymptotically characterized by a simple scaler recursion called state evolution (SE). SE analysis shows that AMP can potentially approach the optimal minimum mean squared-error (MMSE) limit. However, SE may become unreliable for other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal AMP (OAMP) algorithm based on de-correlated linear estimation (LE) and divergence-free non-linear estimation (NLE). The Onsager term in standard AMP vanishes as a result of the divergence-free constraint on NLE. We develop an SE procedure for OAMP and show numerically that the SE for OAMP is accurate for a wide range of sensing matrices, including IID Gaussian matrices, partial orthogonal matrices, and general unitarily-invariant matrices. We further derive optimized options for OAMP and show that the corresponding SE fixed point coincides with the optimal performance obtained via the replica method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal AMP for compressed sensing with unitarily-invariant matrices","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606840","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606840.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal AMP for compressed sensing with unitarily-invariant matrices","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7606840/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424578","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal AMP for compressed sensing with unitarily-invariant matrices","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p280-ma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099119S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7606841,"authors":[{"name":"Jinfeng Du","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs Holmdel, NJ"],"firstName":"Jinfeng","lastName":"Du","id":"37588537800"},{"name":"Muriel M\u00e9dard","affiliation":["MIT, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Muriel","lastName":"M\u00e9dard","id":"37268947300"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":[""],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1090-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1091-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606841","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Interference","Aggregates","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","costing","MIMO communication","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local cooperation cost","hierarchical virtual MIMO transmission schemes","hierarchical cooperation schemes","wireless networks","neighboring nodes","multiple-input multiple-output connections","nodes clusters","all source-destination pairs","capacity scaling bounds","local communication cost","cooperation hierarchy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scalability","distributed cooperation","wireless networks","virtual MIMO"]}],"abstract":"Hierarchical cooperation schemes in wireless networks rely on local cooperation among neighboring nodes to create virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) connections between clusters of nodes.

Under the bRSB assumption, the single user system is a scalar channel with additive noise where the noise term is given by the sum of an independent Gaussian random variable and b correlated interference terms.

In this paper, a Gibbs-based sampler named as symmetric Metropolis-within-Gibbs (SMWG) algorithm is proposed for lattice Gaussian sampling. By adopting a symmetric Metropolis-Hastings (MH) step into the Gibbs update, we show the Markov chain arising from it is geometrically ergodic, which converges exponentially fast to the stationary distribution. Moreover, by optimizing its symmetric proposal distribution, the convergence efficiency can be further enhanced.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606863","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606863.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"398","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for lattice Gaussian sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for lattice Gaussian sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7606863/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424520","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606863/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for lattice Gaussian sampling","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p394-wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048509S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7606867,"authors":[{"name":"Siyuan Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Siyuan Wu","id":"37087493180"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292791800"},{"name":"Martin Johnston","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Johnston","id":"37274107100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1090-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1091-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606867","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606867","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Interpolation","Complexity theory","Encoding","Reliability","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic geometric codes","decoding","interpolation","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity chase decoding","algebraic-geometric code","Koetter interpolation","AG code","Reed-Solomon code","RS code","low complexity chase decoding algorithm","LCC decoding algorithm","Hermitian code","test-vector","message recovery","Koetter-Vardy soft decoding algorithm","KV soft decoding algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algebraic-geometric codes","Chase decoding","decoding complexity","Hermitian codes","interpolation"]}],"abstract":"Algebraic-geometric (AG) codes have long been considered as a possible candidate to replace Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. However, their decoding remains complex and infeasible to implement. Addressing this challenge, our paper proposes a low-complexity Chase (LCC) decoding algorithm for the most popular class of AG codes - Hermitian codes. The LCC decoding is realised by formulating decoding test-vectors, which allows Koetter's interpolation to be performed for common and uncommon elements. This reduces redundant computations and also removes the need to calculate the corresponding coefficients of a Hermitian curve, thus facilitating message recovery. Our simulation results show that significant coding gains can be achieved over the conventional Koetter-Vardy (KV) soft decoding algorithm, but with a much lower computational cost. Moreover, we also show that in comparison with RS codes of a similar length, Chase decoding has a more significant impact on enhancing the performance of Hermitian codes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606867","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606867.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"418","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity Chase decoding of algebraic-geometric codes using Koetter's interpolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity Chase decoding of algebraic-geometric codes using Koetter's interpolation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7606867/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424586","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606867/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity Chase decoding of algebraic-geometric codes using Koetter's interpolation","confLoc":"Cambridge","sourcePdf":"p414-wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078103S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7606869,"authors":[{"name":"Maxime Ferreira Da Costa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Maxime","lastName":"Ferreira Da Costa","id":"37087646096"},{"name":"Wei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37555483600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1090-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1091-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606869","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"abstract":"Super-resolution theory aims to estimate the discrete components lying in a continuous space that constitute a sparse signal with optimal precision.

Based on the identified constraints, we propose a new transmission scheme, which for the case where the identified constraints are active, achieves the number of DoF greater than that achieved by the transmission scheme proposed in [1], where only the number of decodable information symbols is transmitted.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the achievable degrees of freedom of the MIMO X-channel with delayed CSIT","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606877","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606877.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the achievable degrees of freedom of the MIMO X-channel with delayed CSIT","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7606877/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424534","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the achievable degrees of freedom of the MIMO X-channel with delayed CSIT","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p464-buzuverov.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04724S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7606878,"authors":[{"name":"Adel M.

Each node has a separate-antenna full-duplex MIMO transceiver with a different number of antennas, where each antenna can be configured for either signal transmission or reception. Each node has two unicast messages to be delivered to the two other nodes. We first derive upper bounds on the total DoF of the system. Cut-set bounds in conjunction with genie-aided bounds are derived to characterize the achievable total DoF. Afterwards, we analytically derive the optimal number of transmit and receive antennas at each node to maximize the total DoF of the system, subject to the total number of antennas at each node. Finally, the achievable schemes are constructed. The proposed schemes are mainly based on zero-forcing and null-space transmit beamforming.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2016.7606878","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592513/7606780/07606878.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2016.7606878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric degrees of freedom of the full-duplex MIMO 3-way channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606878/","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric degrees of freedom of the full-duplex MIMO 3-way channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424595","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7606878/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric degrees of freedom of the full-duplex MIMO 3-way channel","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"p469-elmahdy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09298S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592513","isNumber":"7606780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592513","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7606780","articleId":"7606878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7606888,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Teng","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Teng","id":"37085887356"},{"name":"Chenguang Yang","affiliation":["Zienkiewicz Centre for Computational Engineering, Swansea University, UK"],"firstName":"Chenguang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404783000"},{"name":"Bin Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37081300300"},{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Li","id":"37309823400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3364-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3363-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3365-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606888","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Manipulator dynamics","Symmetric matrices","Robustness","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","approximation theory","control system synthesis","manipulators","neurocontrollers","robust control","switching systems (control)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global adaptive dynamic surface tracking control","neural network","DSC","robot manipulator system","adaptive neural control algorithms","semi-globally uniformly ultimate boundedness","SGUUB","globally uniformly ultimately bounded stability","switching mechanism","robust controller","transient state variables","neural approximation region","2-joint robot manipulator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606888","abstract":"A neural network empowered dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is addressed for robot manipulators system with unknown dynamics.

The main features are as follows: 1) to our best knowledge, it is for the first time to use the neural networks and decentralized DSIC scheme to deal with both time delays and asymmetric hysteresis when only the output of each subsystem is available; 2) by combining the Finite Covering Lemma with FLSs, the assumptions of the conservative upper bound functions on the time-delay functions are removed and the Krasovskii functionals are abandoned when deal with time delays. Also, the time delay functions extends to a more general one with states variables and time-delay variables being coupled; 3) by using the initializing technique, the \u2112\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n norm of the tracking error is obtained; 4) compared with output-feedback backstepping control schemes, the controller design procedures and analysis of stability are greatly simplified by using the proposed decentralized DSIC method in which the low-pass filter at each design step is introduced. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICARM.2016.7606964","startPage":"461","endPage":"466","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARM.2016.7606964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606880","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592497/7606880/07606964.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized adaptive output-feedback inverse control for a class of large-scale time delay nonlinear hysteretic systems via neural networks approximator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606964/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decentralized adaptive output-feedback inverse control for a class of large-scale time delay nonlinear hysteretic systems via neural networks approximator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7606964/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16413348","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized adaptive output-feedback inverse control for a class of large-scale time delay nonlinear hysteretic systems via neural networks approximator","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"080Paper112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075392S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592497","isNumber":"7606880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592497","xplore-issue":"7606880","articleId":"7606964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7606972,"authors":[{"name":"Manasa Madhavi Puralachetty","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, University College of Engineering Kakinada, Kakinada, India"],"firstName":"Manasa Madhavi","lastName":"Puralachetty","id":"37085836566"},{"name":"Vinay Kumar Pamula","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, University College of Engineering Kakinada, Kakinada, India"],"firstName":"Vinay Kumar","lastName":"Pamula","id":"38622554700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3364-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3363-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3365-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606972","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606972","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Liquids","Linear programming","Tuning","Optimization","Level control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","evolutionary computation","level control","particle swarm optimisation","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization algorithms","PID controller tuning","two stage initialization","population vectors","differential evolution","coupled tank liquid level control system","TSI","objective function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimization algorithms","PID Controller","Coupled tank liquid level control system","Two stage initialization","DE","PSO"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICARM.2016.7606972","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592497/7606880/07606972.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)","startPage":"507","endPage":"511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARM.2016.7606972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential evolution and particle swarm optimization algorithms with two stage initialization for PID controller tuning in coupled tank liquid level system","abstract":"In this paper, a different type of initialization technique called the two stage initialization (TSI) is used for initializing the population vectors of differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). These two stage initialized optimization algorithms are then used to tune the PID controller for a coupled tank liquid level control system. In TSI, the population vector is randomly generated in two stages which would then go through the various phases involved in the algorithms. The PID controller is the most preferred controller in almost all process control industries due to its robustness and dynamic behavior. Hence it has been chosen for controlling the coupled tank liquid level system in this paper. Comparison of the application of four optimization algorithms out of which two are already existing ones and the other two are their TSI versions to PID-coupled tank liquid level system is also done. It can be found that TSI not only helps the existing optimization algorithms to start at a better optima but also to converge at a lesser minimum value of the objective function, which is often desirable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606972/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16413387","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7606972/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Differential evolution and particle swarm optimization algorithms with two stage initialization for PID controller tuning in coupled tank liquid level system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential evolution and particle swarm optimization algorithms with two stage initialization for PID controller tuning in coupled tank liquid level system","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"088Paper132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052042S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592497","isNumber":"7606880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592497","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7606880","articleId":"7606972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7606982,"authors":[{"name":"Zerui Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zerui","lastName":"Li","id":"37085863562"},{"name":"Yu Kang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Kang","id":"37402824500"},{"name":"Wenjun Lv","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37085553239"},{"name":"Yunbo Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yunbo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403489700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3364-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3363-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3365-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7606982","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7606982","abstract":"The emissions of on-road vehicles are studied based on a remote sensing system and artificial neural network models.

It is broadly accepted that ultrasound imaging is an important and frequently used tool for breast cancer diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel computer-aided diagnosis scheme for breast lesions classification. In this scheme, the sonographic breast images are first used to produce Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon based feature scoring data. Biclustering mining is then used as a powerful tool to discover the effective local diagnosis patterns in training data, and those found biclusters are utilized to generate hidden features as new input data. Finally the back-propagation (BP) neural network algorithm is applied to produce an efficient classifier for recognizing benign and malignant breast tumors. Our experimental results show that the proposed method yielded good prediction performance, indicating its interesting potential in clinical applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICARM.2016.7606988","startPage":"597","endPage":"601","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARM.2016.7606988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7606880","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592497/7606880/07606988.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach based on biclustering and neural network for classification of lesions in breast ultrasound","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7606988/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An approach based on biclustering and neural network for classification of lesions in breast ultrasound","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7606988/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16413320","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach based on biclustering and neural network for classification of lesions in breast ultrasound","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"104Paper067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097611S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592497","isNumber":"7606880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592497","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7606880","articleId":"7606988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7607024,"authors":[{"name":"Rachel Courtland","affiliation":["College of Applied Sciences, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China","The University of Michigan, Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning 2000 Bonisteel Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Courtland","id":"37705372300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"7607024","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":531},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The molten tin solution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mirrors","Ultraviolet sources","Tin","Lithography","Plasmas","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","integrated circuit manufacture","semiconductor technology","silicon","tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molten tin solution","tall machine","global foundry facility","north of Albany","silicon wafers zip","ceiling-mounted track","raw silicon","smartphone","personal computer","microprocessor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7607024","abstract":"Even after you don a bunny suit and get deep inside Fab 8, it's hard to get a sense of scale.

increasing dependence on network services of our society, research has recently been concentrating on enhancing traditional protection strategies to withstand large-scale failures, as in case of disaster events. The recently-formed EU-funded RECODIS project aims at coordinating and fostering research collaboration in Europe on disaster resiliency in communication networks. In particular, the Working Group (WG) 2 of the RECODIS project focuses on developing new network-resiliency strategies to survive weather-based disruptions. As a first step, WG2 members have conducted a comprehensive literature survey on existing studies on this topic. This paper classifies and summarizes the most relevant studies collected by WG2 members in this first phase of the project. While the majority of studies regarding weather-based disruptions deals with wireless network (as wireless channel is directly affected by weather conditions), in this survey we cover also disaster-resiliency approaches designed for wired network if they leverage network reconfiguration based on disaster \u201calerts\u201d, considering that many weather-based disruptions grant an \u201calert\u201d thanks to weather forecast.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7608264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16424447","htmlLink":"/document/7608264/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A survey on network resiliency methodologies against weather-based disruptions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey on network resiliency methodologies against weather-based disruptions","confLoc":"Halmstad, Sweden","sourcePdf":"paper03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137436S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589834","isNumber":"7608258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589834","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7608258","articleId":"7608264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7608300,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37073399900"},{"name":"Yuming Mao","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Mao","id":"37274109700"},{"name":"Supeng Leng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Supeng","lastName":"Leng","id":"37602353100"},{"name":"Alexey Vinel","affiliation":["Halmstad University, Halmstad, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Vinel","id":"37296566400"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Simula Research Laboratory, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9023-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9021-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9024-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7608300","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Contracts","Cloud computing","Servers","Mobile communication","Roads","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","resource allocation","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay constrained offloading","mobile edge computing","cloud-enabled vehicular networks","remote clouds","local vehicular terminals","latency reduction","transmission cost reduction","MEC offloading framework","computation offloading strategy","MEC service provider","MEC server","contract-based computation resource allocation scheme","contract theoretic approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicular networks","cloud","mobile edge computing","contract","offloading"]}],"abstract":"Cloud-based vehicular networks is a new paradigm to improve the vehicular services through distributing computation tasks between remote clouds and local vehicular terminals. To further reduce the latency and the transmission cost of the computation offloading, we propose a cloud-based Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offloading framework in vehicular networks. In the framework, efficient computation offloading strategies are designed through a contract theoretic approach. We obtain the optimal feasible contracts that maximize the benefit of the MEC service provider while enhancing the utilities of the vehicles. Furthermore, considering the resource limitation of the MEC server and the latency tolerance of the computation tasks, we propose a contract-based computation resource allocation scheme. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme greatly enhances the utility of the MEC service provider.","doi":"10.1109/RNDM.2016.7608300","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Workshop on Resilient Networks Design and Modeling (RNDM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Workshop on Resilient Networks Design and Modeling (RNDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589834/7608258/07608300.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7608258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RNDM.2016.7608300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay constrained offloading for Mobile Edge Computing in cloud-enabled vehicular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7608300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Delay constrained offloading for Mobile Edge Computing in cloud-enabled vehicular networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7608300/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16424443","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7608300/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay constrained offloading for Mobile Edge Computing in cloud-enabled vehicular networks","confLoc":"Halmstad, Sweden","sourcePdf":"paper39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059094S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589834","isNumber":"7608258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589834","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7608258","articleId":"7608300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"}]
