Previous work has shown that the incorporation of a scalable source coding scheme with multiresolution modulation provides a promising design paradigm for the practical realization of the information-theoretic performance predictions originally developed by Cover, which demonstrated that optimal multicast/broadcast performance could be achieved by an embedded transmission scheme. Hence, the major technical challenge associated with the design of an end-to-end embedded multicast/broadcast system is how to match an embedded modulation constellation with a scalable source coding scheme. In this work, taking into consideration both the interference-limited and bandwidth-limited characteristics of a CDMA system, we provide a cross-layer approach incorporating adaptive power allocation and channel coding strategies and effectively match a discrete cosine transform based scalable motion-compensated video encoder to an embedded multiresolution modulation scheme to simultaneously deliver a basic quality-of-service (QoS) to less capable receivers while maximizing both the QoS for more capable receivers and the system capacity. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using the ITU-T H.263+ video scalable hybrid coder, although the approach is generally extensible to other scalable coding schemes as well","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An End-to-End Embedded Approach for Multicast/Broadcast of Scalable Video over Multiuser CDMA Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2006.887993","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4130360/04130363.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2006.887993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4130360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4130363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4130363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"An End-to-End Embedded Approach for Multicast/Broadcast of Scalable Video over Multiuser CDMA Wireless Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4130363/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9370079","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An End-to-End Embedded Approach for Multicast/Broadcast of Scalable Video over Multiuser CDMA Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"09tmm03-chan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120608S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4130360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4130360","articleId":"4130363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4130370,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Jurca","affiliation":[" Signal Processing Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Jurca","id":"37296919200"},{"name":"Pascal Frossard","affiliation":[" Signal Processing Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Frossard","id":"37285156300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-9210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0077"}],"articleNumber":"4130370","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":787},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits &amp; Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Scheduling algorithm","Bandwidth","Algorithm design and analysis","Timing","Delay","Predictive models","Network servers","Heuristic algorithms","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distortion","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication network topology","tree searching","video servers","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video packet selection","scheduling","multipath video streaming","distortion","network bandwidth","optimization problem","video abstraction model","branch-bound algorithm","heuristic-based algorithm","load-balancing principle","polynomial time complexity","channel bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Branch and bound","load balancing","multipath streaming","packet scheduling"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of choosing the best streaming policy for distortion optimal multipath video delivery, under network bandwidth and playback delay constraints. The streaming policy consists in a joint selection of the network path and of the video packets to be transmitted, along with their sending time. A simple streaming model is introduced, which takes into account the video packet importance, and the dependencies between packets. A careful timing analysis allows to compute the quality perceived by the receiver for a constrained playback delay, as a function of the streaming policy. We derive an optimization problem based on a video abstraction model, under the assumption that the server knows, or can predict accurately the state of the network. A detailed analysis of constrained multipath streaming systems provides helpful insights to design an efficient branch and bound algorithm that finds the optimal streaming strategy. This solution allows to bound the performance of any scheduling strategy, but the complexity of the algorithm becomes rapidly intractable. We therefore propose a fast heuristic-based algorithm, built on load-balancing principles. It allows to reach close to optimal performance with a polynomial time complexity. The algorithm is then adapted to live streaming scenarios, where the server has only a partial knowledge of the packet stream, and the channel bandwidth. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm only induces a negligible distortion penalty compared to the optimal strategy, even when the optimization horizon is limited, or the rate estimation is not perfect. Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed scheduling solution performs better than common scheduling algorithms, and therefore represents a very efficient low-complexity multipath streaming algorithm, for both stored and live video services","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Packet Selection and Scheduling for Multipath Streaming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2006.888017","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4130360/04130370.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2006.888017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4130360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4130370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4130370/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"Video Packet Selection and Scheduling for Multipath Streaming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9370077","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Packet Selection and Scheduling for Multipath Streaming","sourcePdf":"09tmm03-jurca.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037983S","chronDate":"April  2007","isNumber":"4130360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"97","articleId":"4130370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4130374,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Potamianos","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/4130360/4130374/4130374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandros Potamianos (M'92) received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 1990.

In this paper, the task and user interface modules of a multimodal dialogue system development platform are presented. The main goal of this work is to provide a simple, application-independent solution to the problem of multimodal dialogue design for information seeking applications. The proposed system architecture clearly separates the task and interface components of the system. A task manager is designed and implemented that consists of two main submodules: the electronic form module that handles the list of attributes that have to be instantiated by the user, and the agenda module that contains the sequence of user and system tasks. Both the electronic forms and the agenda can be dynamically updated by the user. Next a spoken dialogue module is designed that implements the speech interface for the task manager. The dialogue manager can handle complex error correction and clarification user input, building on the semantics and pragmatic modules presented in Part I of this paper. The spoken dialogue system is evaluated for a travel reservation task of the DARPA Communicator research program and shown to yield over 90% task completion and good performance for both objective and subjective evaluation metrics. Finally, a multimodal dialogue system which combines graphical and speech interfaces, is designed, implemented and evaluated. Minor modifications to the unimodal semantic and pragmatic modules were required to build the multimodal system. It is shown that the multimodal system significantly outperforms the unimodal speech-only system both in terms of efficiency (task success and time to completion) and user satisfaction for a travel reservation task","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2006.887999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4130360/04130374.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2006.887999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4130360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Seeking Spoken Dialogue Systems\u2014 Part II: Multimodal Dialogue","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4130374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4130374/","displayDocTitle":"Information Seeking Spoken Dialogue Systems\u2014 Part II: Multimodal Dialogue","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9370070","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4130374/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Seeking Spoken Dialogue Systems\u2014 Part II: Multimodal Dialogue","sourcePdf":"09tmm03-potamianos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113213S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4130360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4130360","articleId":"4130374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4130380,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-Tsin Wong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tien-Tsin","lastName":"Wong","id":"37280236200"},{"name":"Chi-Sing Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Sing","lastName":"Leung","id":"38184015100"},{"name":"Pheng-Ann Heng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Pheng-Ann","lastName":"Heng","id":"37283077400"},{"name":"Jianqing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280526900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-9210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0077"}],"articleNumber":"4130380","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":496},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits &amp; Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Hardware","Computer graphics","Application software","Microcomputers","Parallel processing","Performance gain","Costs","Wavelet transforms","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","image resolution","parallel processing","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transform","consumer-level graphics hardware","personal computers","graphics processing unit","SIMD-based parallel processing","inverse wavelet transform","wavelet-based geometric design","image processing","texture-illuminance decoupling","JPEG2000 image encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transform","graphics processing unit","JPEG2000","shader"]}],"abstract":"Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been heavily studied and developed in various scientific and engineering fields. Its multiresolution and locality nature facilitates applications requiring progressiveness and capturing high-frequency details. However, when dealing with enormous data volume, its performance may drastically reduce. On the other hand, with the recent advances in consumer-level graphics hardware, personal computers nowadays usually equip with a graphics processing unit (GPU) based graphics accelerator which offers SIMD-based parallel processing power. This paper presents a SIMD algorithm that performs the convolution-based DWT completely on a GPU, which brings us significant performance gain on a normal PC without extra cost. Although the forward and inverse wavelet transforms are mathematically different, the proposed algorithm unifies them to an almost identical process that can be efficiently implemented on GPU. Different wavelet kernels and boundary extension schemes can be easily incorporated by simply modifying input parameters.

While the compressed videos are transmitted through error-prone networks, error robustness becomes an important issue. In the past years, a number of rate-distortion (R-D) optimized coding mode selection schemes have been proposed for error-resilient video coding, including a recursive optimal per-pixel estimate (ROPE) method. However, the ROPE-related approaches assume integer-pixel motion-compensated prediction rather than subpixel prediction, whose extension to H.264 is not straightforward. Alternatively, an error-robust R-D optimization (ER-RDO) method has been included in H.264 test model, in which the estimate of pixel distortion is derived by simulating decoding process multiple times in the encoder. Obviously, the computing complexity is very high. To address this problem, we propose a new end-to-end distortion model for R-D optimized coding mode selection, in which the overall distortion is taken as the sum of several separable distortion items. Thus, it can suppress the approximation errors caused by pixel averaging operations such as subpixel prediction. Based on the proposed end-to-end distortion model, a new Lagrange multiplier is derived for R-D optimized coding mode selection in packet-loss environment by taking into account of the network conditions.

In a practical coding system, this task requires knowledge of the relationship between quantization step size and compressed rate for each group of wavelet coefficients, the R-Q curve. A common approach to this problem is to fit each subband with a scalar probability distribution and compute entropy estimates based on the model. This approach is not effective at rates below 1.0 bits-per-pixel because the distributions of quantized data do not reflect the dependencies in coefficient magnitudes. These dependencies can be addressed with doubly stochastic models, which have been previously proposed to characterize more localized behavior, though there are tradeoffs between storage, computation time, and accuracy. Using a doubly stochastic generalized Gaussian model, it is demonstrated that the relationship between step size and rate is accurately described by a low degree polynomial in the logarithm of the step size. Based on this observation, an entropy estimation scheme is presented which offers an excellent tradeoff between speed and accuracy; after a simple data-gathering step, estimates are computed instantaneously by evaluating a single polynomial for each group of wavelet coefficients quantized with the same step size. These estimates are on average within 3% of a desired target rate for several of state-of-the-art coders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4130423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9374485","htmlLink":"/document/4130423/","pubMedId":"17405430","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Entropy Estimation Based on Doubly Stochastic Models for Quantized Wavelet Image Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Entropy Estimation Based on Doubly Stochastic Models for Quantized Wavelet Image Data","sourcePdf":"16tip04-gaubatz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100415S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4130412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4130412","articleId":"4130423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4130427,"authors":[{"name":"Weiming Hu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4130412/4130427/4130427-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiming Hu received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, China.","From April 1998 to March 2000, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Institute of Computer Science and Technology and Founder of the Research and Design Center, Peking University, China.

Effective indexing and retrieval from surveillance video databases are very important. Although there are many ways to represent the content of video clips in current video retrieval algorithms, there still exists a semantic gap between users and retrieval systems. Visual surveillance systems supply a platform for investigating semantic-based video retrieval. In this paper, a semantic-based video retrieval framework for visual surveillance is proposed. A cluster-based tracking algorithm is developed to acquire motion trajectories. The trajectories are then clustered hierarchically using the spatial and temporal information, to learn activity models. A hierarchical structure of semantic indexing and retrieval of object activities, where each individual activity automatically inherits all the semantic descriptions of the activity model to which it belongs, is proposed for accessing video clips and individual objects at the semantic level. The proposed retrieval framework supports various queries including queries by keywords, multiple object queries, and queries by sketch. For multiple object queries, succession and simultaneity restrictions, together with depth and breadth first orders, are considered. For sketch-based queries, a method for matching trajectories drawn by users to spatial trajectories is proposed. The effectiveness and efficiency of our framework are tested in a crowded traffic scene","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surveillance","Indexing","Content based retrieval","Clustering algorithms","Information retrieval","Visual databases","Tracking","Trajectory","Testing","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database indexing","image matching","image motion analysis","video databases","video retrieval","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic-based surveillance video retrieval","surveillance video databases","cluster-based tracking algorithm","motion trajectories","semantic indexing","multiple object queries","sketch-based queries","matching trajectories","spatial trajectories"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Activity models","semantic-based","video retrieval","visual surveillance"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Security","Database Management Systems","Databases, Factual","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Natural Language Processing","Semantics","User-Computer Interface","Video Recording"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.891352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4130412/04130427.pdf","startPage":"1168","endPage":"1181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4130412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.891352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic-Based Surveillance Video Retrieval","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4130427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semantic-Based Surveillance Video Retrieval","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4130427/","volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4130427/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9374501","pubMedId":"17405446","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic-Based Surveillance Video Retrieval","sourcePdf":"16tip04-hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16441S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4130412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"4130412","articleId":"4130427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4130433,"authors":[{"name":"Lidan Miao","affiliation":["Advanced Imaging and Collaborative Information Processing (AICIP) Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4130412/4130433/4130433-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lidan Miao (S'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.

The entire process is often referred to as mixed-pixel decomposition or spectral unmixing. Although various algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, two potential issues still need to be further investigated. First, assuming the endmembers are known, the abundance estimation is commonly performed by employing a least-squares error criterion, which, however, makes the estimation sensitive to noise and outliers. Second, the mathematical intractability of the abundance non-negative constraint results in computationally expensive numerical approaches. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised decomposition method based on the classic maximum entropy principle, termed the gradient descent maximum entropy (GDME), aiming at robust and effective estimates. We address the importance of the maximum entropy principle for mixed-pixel decomposition from a geometric point of view and demonstrate that when the given data present strong noise or when the endmember signatures are close to each other, the proposed method has the potential of providing more accurate estimates than the popular least-squares methods (e.g., fully constrained least squares). We apply the proposed GDME to the subject of unmixing multispectral and hyperspectral data. The experimental results obtained from both simulated and real images show the effectiveness of the proposed method","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.891350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4130412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4130412/04130433.pdf","endPage":"1021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Maximum Entropy Approach to Unsupervised Mixed-Pixel Decomposition","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.891350","startPage":"1008","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4130433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Maximum Entropy Approach to Unsupervised Mixed-Pixel Decomposition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4130433/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9374488","pubMedId":"17405433","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4130433/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Maximum Entropy Approach to Unsupervised Mixed-Pixel Decomposition","sourcePdf":"16tip04-miao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08726S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4130412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4130412","articleId":"4130433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4130435,"authors":[{"name":"Christophoros Nikou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina (UoI), Ioannina, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4130412/4130435/4130435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christophoros Nikou (S'97\u2013A'00\u2013M'05) received the the Diploma degree in electrical engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1994, and the DEA and Ph.D. degrees in image processing and computer vision from Louis Pasteur University, Strasbourg, France, in 1995 and 1999, respectively.","During 2001, he was a Senior Researcher with the Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

The main novelty of this work is a new family of smoothness priors for the label probabilities in spatially variant mixture models. These Gauss-Markov random field-based priors allow all their parameters to be estimated in closed form via the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using the expectation-maximization methodology. Thus, it is possible to introduce priors with multiple parameters that adapt to different aspects of the data. Numerical experiments are presented where the proposed MAP algorithms were tested in various image segmentation scenarios.

In order to avoid this parasitic degradation, the transistor manufacturer should supply transistors which have at least partial transformation networks incorporated within the package.

These provide extremely fast transition times (low cross talk) and eliminate the need for weighty isolators. The properties of a single device are exploited to achieve low consumption modulation. The approach entails firstly, a detailed device characterisation, secondly its design and realisation based on a careful tradeoff using CAD techniques. Thirdly, recorded results show gains of 10 dB and `on' to `off' ratios of 40 dB.

We show the great influence of the second gate load termination on the microwave performances.

A notable exception has been a phased array built by Chalmers University of Technology (Ref.1). In any case the shipboard antenna must track satellites in the presence of severe ship dynamics. For dish and fixed array antennas this requirement leads to the widespread use of relatively elaborate and costly inertial stabilization mechanisms. To eliminate the need for mechanical stabilization an electronically steered phased array antenna is proposed. The antenna is conceptually similar to the Chalmers antenna; however, circuit implementation is radically different. Two flat plate arrays are used. An array comprises 64 radiating elements each independently driven by a 3 bit phasor. To minimize component inter-connects and assembly cost, radiating elements, phasors and corporate feed network are implemented in microstrip on large (0.9m \u00d7 0.9m) circuit boards in a multi-layer laminated assembly.","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1985.333559","publicationTitle":"1985 15th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1985 15th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4132141/4132142/04132247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1985.333559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4132142","startPage":"700","endPage":"705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An L Band Phased Array Antenna for Marine Satellite Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4132247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An L Band Phased Array Antenna for Marine Satellite Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4132247/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 1985","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An L Band Phased Array Antenna for Marine Satellite Communications","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04284S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 1985","isNumber":"4132142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4132141","articleId":"4132247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4132294,"authors":[{"name":"Matsuo Sekine","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Matsuo","lastName":"Sekine","id":"37290483900"},{"name":"Chen Chii-Dong","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chii-Dong","id":"38306463800"}],"articleNumber":"4132294","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"Specific attenuation values from 1 to 1000 GHz are calculated by using the negative exponential, Best and Weibull raindrop-size distributions.

They demonstrate the potential of the approach for the solution of highly complex (M)MIC design problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"1987 17th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4132314/4132315/04132379.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"1987 17th European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1987.333772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1987.333772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4132315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4132379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular Source-Type 3D Analysis of Scattering Parameters for General Discontinuities, Components and Coupling Effects in (M)MICs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering parameters","Shape","Current density","Strips","Circuits","Conductors","Integral equations","Electromagnetic scattering","Surface waves","Surface treatment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4132379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Sept. 1987","displayDocTitle":"Modular Source-Type 3D Analysis of Scattering Parameters for General Discontinuities, Components and Coupling Effects in (M)MICs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","conferenceDate":"7-11 Sept. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular Source-Type 3D Analysis of Scattering Parameters for General Discontinuities, Components and Coupling Effects in (M)MICs","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026134S","chronDate":"7-11 Sept. 1987","isNumber":"4132315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4132314","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4132379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4132412,"authors":[{"name":"Vittorio Rizzoli","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica Informatica Sistemistica, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Rizzoli","id":"37275106700"},{"name":"Claudio Cecchetti","affiliation":["Fondazione Ugo Bordoni, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Cecchetti","id":"37301180000"},{"name":"Alessandro Lipparini","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica Informatica Sistemistica, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Lipparini","id":"37268750100"}],"articleNumber":"4132412","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"The paper introduces a user-oriented program providing a general-purpose solution to multitone excitation problems of nonlinear microwave circuits.

For a 40-MVA EAF in Tennessee, USA, a cascade-multilevel converter (CMC)-based STATic synchronous COMpensator (STATCOM) with high bandwidth is proposed for EAF flicker mitigation. In this paper, flicker mitigation techniques by using a CMC-based STATCOM are presented and verified through a transient network analyzer (TNA) system.

Consequently, the motor drive systems with fault diagnostic and prediction features are of great concern and are becoming almost indispensable. Among all kinds of common faults, quite a few have relationship with unequal air gap. So far, work on detection of eccentricity-related faults in induction and synchronous machines has been well documented. However, a few are reported on faults resulting from axial nonuniform air gap. This paper investigates the performance of a three-phase induction machine with nonuniform static eccentricity (SE) along axial direction or inclined SE. A variant of modified winding function approach is applied to study this fault. The relationship between the number of rotor bars and poles, and the existence of fault-related current harmonics is discussed. It is shown that inclined eccentricity also demonstrates similar characteristics such as circumferential nonuniform air gap (SE). More importantly, it has been proved conclusively that inclined eccentricity symmetric to the midpoint of the machine shaft cannot be recognized from the current spectrum and would therefore require some other form of detection. Finite-element results to verify the inductance values used in simulation are also presented. The analysis is supplemented by the stator current spectra obtained from simulated results for different load and fault conditions. Finally, a four-pole 45-rotor-bar 2-kW induction motor is used to validate the theoretical and simulation results experimentally. Both current as well as vibration spectra are presented","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2006.889806","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4132857/04132877.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2006.889806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4132857","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4132877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of a Three-Phase Induction Machine With Inclined Static Eccentricity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-april  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4132877/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of a Three-Phase Induction Machine With Inclined Static Eccentricity","volume":"43","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4132877/","publicationDate":"March-april 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9370930","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of a Three-Phase Induction Machine With Inclined Static Eccentricity","sourcePdf":"43tia02-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061304S","chronDate":"March-april  2007","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4132857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4132857","articleId":"4132877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4132878,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Lineykin","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4132857/4132878/4132878-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Simon Lineykin received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interests are modeling and emulation of physical processes and active cooling systems using Peltier effect."]},"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lineykin","id":"37275353900"},{"name":"Shmuel Ben-Yaakov","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4132857/4132878/4132878-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Shmuel (Sam) Ben-Yaakov (M'87) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 1961, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 1967 and 1970, respectively.","He is presently a Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, and heads the Power Electronics Group there.

With an appropriately selected measure, the result is applicable to a wide range of observation processes, including the hybrid case of observations formed by an arbitrary combination of continuous and discrete measurements, which may be sampled with a priori unknown, changing, and, possibly, random rates and delays. The simultaneous presence of continuous and sampled measurements causes impulsive discontinuity in the inputs of the optimal filter equations, which leads to a discontinuous change in state estimates every time a sampled measurement becomes available. Using the theory of vibrosolutions, the explicit and unique expressions for the jumps in state estimates and estimation error covariance are derived. Several examples illustrate the procedure of modeling hybrid measurement systems by selecting an appropriate discontinuous measure. We further show that the Itocirc-Volterra model and the main result of the paper can be specialized to several important cases, including state space systems, for which we recover several known state estimation results, and derive a novel optimal filter for continuous LTV systems with an arbitrary combination of continuous and delayed sampled measurements. This optimal filter updates the state estimates for incoming measurements as soon as they become available and does not require prior knowledge of sampling instants and delays, which makes it applicable when deterministic and random changes in sampling and delays are present.

Data from a test group consisting of 10 subjects are used to evaluate the new methods and to compare them to standard techniques. Using 1-s signal segments, six different visual stimulation frequencies could be discriminated with an average classification accuracy of 84%.

The method is based on the differential equations that describe the conservation of electric flux and membrane currents. By introducing the electric flux through the cell membrane as an additional variable, the algorithm decouples the linear partial differential equation part from the nonlinear ordinary differential equation part that defines the membrane dynamics of interest. This conveniently results in two subproblems: a linear interface problem and a nonlinear initial value problem. The linear interface problem is solved with a hybrid FEM. The initial value problem is integrated by a standard ordinary differential equation solver such as the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods. During time integration, these two subproblems are solved alternatively. The algorithm can be used to model the interaction of stimuli with multiple cells of almost arbitrary geometries and complex ion-channel gating at the plasma membrane. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating the uses of the method for modeling field stimulation and action potential propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical

In this brief, we present a new adaptive equalization algorithm that jointly exploits the amplitude and phase information of the input signal.

However, robust near-field adaptive beamforming (NABF) against focal point errors has not been studied much in the literature until recently. In this brief, a robust near-field adaptive beamformer is proposed. The proposed method is developed by combining a new formulation of the point-constrained NABF and a self-calibration technique, in the presence of focal point uncertainties.

A high-performance real-time simulation environment is necessary to obtain high-fidelity results in HIL simulations. This paper presents the detailed implementation of a very-low-cost multisolver hard real-time simulation environment, namely the real-time extension of the virtual test bed (VTB-RT). VTB-RT is implemented completely from open-source software and off-the-shelf hardware. Using VTB-RT, this paper proposes an efficient real-time HIL testing approach for control designs in power electronics applications. VTB-RT enables the natural coupling between the simulation environment and the hardware under test and, thus, makes virtual power exchange in HIL simulation possible. For validation purposes, the proposed real-time HIL testing approach is applied in two well-known power electronics application examples, namely a boost converter and an H-bridge inverter with their respective control systems, representing a very-low-cost and a relatively advanced hardware setup, respectively. The consistency of the experimental results with the theoretical results proves the applicability of VTB-RT and the proposed testing approach.

Hence, when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is performed at the base station, the minimization of power consumption at the mobile terminals is achieved if a joint optimization of power control and ordering (JOPCO) of user detection is carried out. In this paper, we first investigate a closed-form solution to JOPCO, based on the assumption of perfect interference cancellation and complete knowledge of channel correlation among users. By describing the JOPCO problem as an optimization on a suitable graph, it is seen that the optimum solution is NP-hard, and we approximate it by a greedy algorithm. For a practical implementation, we then model JOPCO as a discrete stochastic optimization problem, and we derive a discrete stochastic approximation (DSA) algorithm that iteratively adapts the transmit powers and the SIC detection order. The DSA solution removes the hypothesis on perfect cancellation and explicit knowledge of the users' correlation. Moreover, by a suitable description of the problem, we obtain a simplified DSA algorithm having reduced requirements in both computational complexity and memory. Performance of the various algorithms is assessed by simulations in a universal mobile telecommunications system scenario","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.892458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4132976/04132982.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.892458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4132976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power Control and Receiver Optimization of CDMA Transceivers Using Successive Interference Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4132982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4132982/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power Control and Receiver Optimization of CDMA Transceivers Using Successive Interference Cancellation","volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9370959","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4132982/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power Control and Receiver Optimization of CDMA Transceivers Using Successive Interference Cancellation","sourcePdf":"55tcomm03-benvenuto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103535S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4132976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4132976","articleId":"4132982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4132984,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Clark","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand","Networks Research Centre, British Telecommunications Public Limited Company, Ipswich, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4132976/4132984/4132984-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alan Clark was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1980.

However, the standard TR-UWB scheme, while often motivated by the simplicity of its receiver, is still dogged by implementation concerns. In particular, the receiver requires an extremely wideband delay element, which is difficult to incorporate into low-power integrated systems. In this paper, a TR scheme is proposed in which the separation between the data and reference signals, rather than being a time delay, is a slow rotation over the symbol interval. This provides a (slightly) frequency-shifted reference that, while orthogonal to the data-bearing pulse, still goes through a nearly equal channel. A detailed analysis of the proposed scheme is provided. Simulation results demonstrate the expected result that frequency shifting of the reference in the proposed manner is not effective for high-data-rate systems that experience appreciable intersymbol interference. However, for the targeted low-to-moderate data-rate applications, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system not only achieves the primary goal of providing a much simpler receiver architecture, but also that it outperforms the standard TR-UWB system","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.892452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4132976/04132990.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4132976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.892452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slightly Frequency-Shifted Reference Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4132990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Slightly Frequency-Shifted Reference Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4132990/","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9370954","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4132990/","volume":"55","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slightly Frequency-Shifted Reference Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Radio","sourcePdf":"55tcomm03-goeckel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077246S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4132976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4132976","articleId":"4132990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4132991,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Srikanth Gomadam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4132976/4132991/4132991-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Krishna Srikanth Gomadam (S'05) received the B.

We then propose a partially coherent detector for FSK and differential phase-shift keying that exploits partial channel knowledge to enable the receiver to operate effectively in both fast and slow fading. The maximum-likelihood rule obtained for the partially coherent FSK turns out to be a linear combination of coherent and noncoherent detection rules.

From a receiver design point of view, the phase-ambiguity problem can be by-passed by differential modulation and detection at the expense of a well-known performance loss, in comparison with direct modulation and coherent detection schemes. An alternative approach is followed in this paper. A theoretical minimum mean-square error phase-estimation criterion leads to a supervised phase-recovery procedure that directly corrects the phase of arbitrary linear filter receivers through a simple closed-form projection operation.

These noncoherent detectors, termed Fano ST-MSDDs, employ the well-known Fano algorithm as their decoding engines. Their bit-error rate (BER) performance is excellent, as there is no irreducible error floor, even at very high fade rates. Compared with the sphere decoder, which is optimal, our best detector, termed an on-demand bi-Fano ST-MSDD, suffers only a 0.3 dB degradation in power efficiency. However, its computational complexity, as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is consistently lower than that of the sphere decoder and does not experience the exponential growth in complexity in the latter when the SNR decreases. It can thus be concluded that the Fano algorithm is a powerful detection strategy for differential ST codes in fading channels. Our main contribution is in making the modifications and improvements to the Fano algorithm that enables this realization. The innovations include the bi-Fano, edge-bi-Fano, and on-demand bi-Fano search strategies, as well as a new dynamic threshold adjustment scheme for avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth node evaluations during backtracking","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.888880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.888880","startPage":"540","endPage":"550","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4132976/04133005.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4132976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fano Multiple-Symbol Differential Detectors for Differential Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Fano Multiple-Symbol Differential Detectors for Differential Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","volume":"55","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133005/","accessionNumber":"9370957","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133005/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fano Multiple-Symbol Differential Detectors for Differential Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation","sourcePdf":"55tcomm03-pun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087118S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4132976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4132976","articleId":"4133005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":4133006,"authors":[{"name":"Nazanin Rahnavard","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Nazanin","lastName":"Rahnavard","id":"37283985300"},{"name":"Hossein Pishro-Nik","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Pishro-Nik","id":"38278138700"},{"name":"Faramarz Fekri","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Faramarz","lastName":"Fekri","id":"37284386200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4133006","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":767},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133006","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Parity check codes","Time sharing computer systems","Design methodology","Optical fiber networks","Protection","Bit error rate","Payloads","Protocols","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal error protection","partially regular LDPC codes","low-density parity-check codes","density evolution formulas","binary erasure channel","time-sharing method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","unequal density evolution (UDE)","unequal error protection (UEP)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.892436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4132976/04133006.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.892436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4132976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal Error Protection Using Partially Regular LDPC Codes","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a scheme to construct low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that are suitable for unequal error protection (UEP).

We first develop the dual relation using a generic duality theory in linear programming. This approach naturally leads to the construction of a dual network, and provides machinery for handling a generalized cost function. We then consider the joint MIMO beamforming and power control problem with individual SINR constraints. We apply the network duality to this problem and propose a high-performance iterative algorithm which, compared with past centralized approaches, has improved convergence behavior. Finally, we propose a simpler distributed version of the algorithm tailored for a cellular downlink. This algorithm can be readily implemented in a distributed fashion, since it does not require information exchange between base stations.

The target hard and soft error sequences are provided by computer simulations of uncoded enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) systems with typical urban and rural area channels. Simulation results indicate that the proposed DPBGMs enable us to approximate very closely all the interested burst-error statistics of the target hard and soft error sequences.

We introduce an example of TVAR(m) clutter modeling for high-frequency over-the-horizon radar that demonstrates its practical importance","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.888064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4133013/04133014.pdf","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1311","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.888064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Varying Autoregressive (TVAR) Models for Multiple Radar Observations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"Time-Varying Autoregressive (TVAR) Models for Multiple Radar Observations","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4133014/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9374330","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133014/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Varying Autoregressive (TVAR) Models for Multiple Radar Observations","sourcePdf":"55tsp04-abramovich.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100551S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4133013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4133013","articleId":"4133014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4133016,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Bandiera","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInnovazione, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4133013/4133016/4133016-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Bandiera (M'01) was born in Maglie (LE), Italy, on March 9, 1974.

The algorithm is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. Appropriate priors allow us to introduce correlations between the change locations of the observed signals. Numerical problems inherent to Bayesian inference are solved by a Gibbs sampling strategy. The proposed joint segmentation methodology yields improved segmentation results when compared with parallel and independent individual signal segmentations. The initial algorithm is derived for piecewise constant AR processes whose orders are fixed on each segment. However, an extension to models with unknown model orders is also discussed.

We have called this family: the Constant Norm Algorithms (CNA). This family is derived in the context of Bussgang techniques. Therefore, the resulting algorithms are very simple. We show that some well-known blind algorithms such as \"Sato's algorithm\" or the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) are particular cases in our CNA family. In addition, from this class, a new cost function, named Constant sQuare Algorithm (CQA), is derived, which is well designed for QAM. It results in a lower algorithm noise without increasing the complexity. Another advantage of this class lies in the possibility of creating new norms by combining several existing norms in order to benefit from the advantages of each original norm. For example, we present the norm resulting from the combination of the two algorithms, CMA and CQA. Moreover, we highlight that, with regard to the excess mean-square error performance, there is an optimal norm for each constellation, i.e., each modulation, in order to equalize it blindly","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Algorithms for Blind Equalization: The Constant Norm Algorithm Family","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.889398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4133013/04133033.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.889398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"New Algorithms for Blind Equalization: The Constant Norm Algorithm Family","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4133033/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9374340","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Algorithms for Blind Equalization: The Constant Norm Algorithm Family","sourcePdf":"55tsp04-goupil.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09825S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4133013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4133013","articleId":"4133033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4133034,"authors":[{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["Navini Networks, Richardson, TX, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4133013/4133034/4133034-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Guo received the B.Eng. degree in radio communication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, in July 1998 and the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, in January 2004.

To reduce false localizations, a grid-based Bayesian approach is proposed to jointly track the sequence of the positions and the sight conditions of the MT. This method is based on the assumption that both the MT position and the sight condition are Markov chains whose state is hidden in the received signals [hidden Markov model (HMM)]. The observations used for the HMM localization are obtained from the power-delay profile of the received signals. In ultrawideband (UWB) systems, the use of the whole power-delay profile, rather than the total power only, allows to reach higher localization accuracy, as the power-profile is a joint measurement of time of arrival and power.

The largest value that the SLNR can achieve is shown to be equal to the maximum eigenvalue of a certain random matrix combination, and the probability distribution of this eigenvalue is characterized in terms of a Whittaker function.

The first part of the investigation is deterministic, and the context is that of L-splines; these are defined in the following terms: s(t) is a cardinal L-spline iff L{s(t)}=Sigma \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">kisinZ</sub>\na[k]delta(t-k), where L is a suitable pseudodifferential operator. Our starting point for the construction of \"self-similar\" splines is the identification of the class of differential operators L that are both translation and scale invariant. This results into a two-parameter family of generalized fractional derivatives, part\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tau</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gamma</sup>\n, where gamma is the order of the derivative and tau is an additional phase factor. We specify the corresponding L-splines, which yield an extended class of fractional splines.

We prove that the corresponding variational (or smoothing) spline estimator is a cardinal fractional spline of order 2gamma, which admits a stable representation in a B-spline basis. We characterize the equivalent frequency response of the estimator and show that it closely matches that of a classical Butterworth filter of order 2gamma.

Inspired by the results of classical high-resolution quantization theory, the problem of finite-rate quantized communication system is formulated as a general fixed-rate vector quantization problem with side information available at the encoder (or the quantizer) but unavailable at the decoder. The framework of the quantization problem is sufficiently general to include quantization schemes with general non-mean-squared distortion functions and constrained source vectors. Asymptotic distortion analysis of the proposed general quantization problem is provided by extending the vector version of the Bennett's integral. Specifically, tight lower and upper bounds of the average asymptotic distortion are proposed. Sufficient conditions for the achievability of the distortion bounds are also provided and related to corresponding classical fixed-rate quantization problems. The proposed general methodology provides a powerful analytical tool to study a wide range of finite-rate feedback systems. To illustrate the utility of the framework, we consider the analysis of a finite-rate feedback multiple-input single-output (MISO) beamforming system over independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh flat-fading channels.

The commonality of gene-gene interactions in the underlying genetic architecture of common diseases presents a daunting analytical challenge. Previously, we introduced a grammatical evolution neural network (GENN) approach that has high power to detect such interactions in the absence of any marginal main effects. While the success of this method is encouraging, it elicits questions regarding the evolutionary process of the algorithm itself and the feasibility of scaling the method to account for the immense dimensionality of datasets with enormous numbers of features. When the features of interest show no main effects, how is GENN able to build correct models? How and when should evolutionary parameters be adjusted according to the scale of a particular dataset? In the current study, we monitor the performance of GENN during its evolutionary process using different population sizes and numbers of generations. We also compare the evolutionary characteristics of GENN to that of a random search neural network strategy to better understand the benefits provided by the evolutionary learning process - including advantages with respect to chromosome size and the representation of functional versus non-functional features within the models generated by the two approaches. Finally, we apply lessons from the characterization of GENN to analyses of datasets containing increasing numbers of features to demonstrate the scalability of the method","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2006.330945","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2006.330945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4079469","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4133138/4079469/04133181.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Evolutionary Process of Grammatical Evolution Neural Networks for Feature Selection in Genetic Epidemiology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133181/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Evolutionary Process of Grammatical Evolution Neural Networks for Feature Selection in Genetic Epidemiology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133181/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9452719","pubMedId":"20634919","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","conferenceDate":"28-29 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Sept. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Evolutionary Process of Grammatical Evolution Neural Networks for Feature Selection in Genetic Epidemiology","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CIBCB-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097987S","chronDate":"28-29 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4133138","isNumber":"4079469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133138","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4079469","articleId":"4133181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4133186,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Two ANNs, one with all inputs and the other with a tested input removed are run in parallel and the change in error is calculated as a function of the relative out-of-sample performance of these two networks.

Despite many existing efforts, better gene selection methods that can effectively identify biologically significant biomarkers, yet computationally efficient, are still in need. In this paper, a model-free greedy (MFG) gene selection method is proposed, which implements several intuitive heuristics but doesn't assume any statistical distribution on the expression data.

This capability is crucial for classifying approaching enemy ships and aircrafts. The sensed parameters may vary from their actual or reported values because of man-made variations in the form of agility or staggering.

Associating the measured radar parameter set with a known sighting is a pattern recognition problem in a multi-dimensional space. Several authors have attacked the problem with various data association tools with different merits and de-merits. Most of them are marred by the massive computing power required and unrealistically large training data requirements.

In the last decade, some research on the separation of speech and noise has been published. In previous research work some traditional algorithms were used, such as least mean squares, the nearest neighbour and the quadratic Gaussian algorithms. This paper provides an extensive experimental simulation of speech with and without noise to solve the filtering problem. An FIR digital filter is designed and proposed to train a neural network. The experimental results show that using neural networks in noise separation produce a more robust and powerful separation of speech and noise than other traditional algorithms. Furthermore, the FIR digital filter provides a fast convergence and gives results near the global optimal. The neural networks such as Elman, radial base function and perceptron networks are trained with different training algorithms and compared with the performance of FIR digital filter including its computational complexity. It is found that an algorithm chosen to train the neural network is very important to the final results","doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2005.334440","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Pakistan Section Multitopic Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4133396/4133397/04133455.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 Pakistan Section Multitopic Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2005.334440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fair Play Comparison of Neural Networks Algorithms in Speech Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Neural networks","Speech processing","Speech enhancement","Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Signal processing","Filtering","Noise robustness","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","noise","signal processing","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks algorithms","speech signal processing","noise separation","filtering problem","FIR digital filter","Elman networks","radial base function","perceptron networks","training algorithms","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Fair Play Comparison of Neural Networks Algorithms in Speech Signal Processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133455/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","conferenceDate":"24-25 Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"9420446","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fair Play Comparison of Neural Networks Algorithms in Speech Signal Processing","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"INMIC-00-58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045352S","chronDate":"24-25 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4133396","isNumber":"4133397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133396","xplore-issue":"4133397","articleId":"4133455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4133459,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Transition matrix on the basis of transition from a class in original time series to the class of deformed series is formed. The last few values of the time series are used to find the best deformed series vector using transition matrix and hence future values of the time series are calculated as sum of test vector and differenced series vector. Long range forecasting is achieved by iterating the forecasted values of current iteration as the input for next iteration. The algorithm is validated for benchmark time series forecasting.

Digital implementation can be carried out using finite precision and infinite precision representation of the phased array signal. We consider finite precision representation, since it takes considerably less implementation resources compared with the infinite case. In this paper we evaluate FPGA implementation when quantization is introduced in the phasing network. Digital samples of phased signals are sensitive to finite precision. Finite precision reduces mainlobe level as well as sidelobe gain. For multiple beam generation, it degrades not only the transmitted beam but adjacent beams as well. The quantization effects depend on position of the quantizer. They are different when the quantizer is placed before and after beamforming network.

Routing is one of these areas in which attempts for efficient utilization of energy have been made. These attempts use fixed (crisp) metrics for making energy-aware routing decisions. In this paper, we have presented the design and implementation of a dedicated fuzzy link cost processor (FLCP) on FPGA. The objective of our FLCP is to determine the value of cost for a link between two sensor nodes such that the life of a sensor network is maximized. The FLCP of the gateway, in WSN, periodically invokes the fuzzy routine to determine the cost of link between any two sensor nodes. Once the costs of all possible links to the single destination (gateway) are computed, the route can then be determined using any shortest path algorithm. We have designed for Spartran 3 - timesc3s50 (50k gates).

A systematic technique has been devised and confirmed. This technique uses the RF power transistor's optimum load and source impedances, obtained from the load-pull procedure, to characterize the RF power device at the required output power level and operating frequency band. The input and output device impedances are taken as the complex conjugates of the optimum source and load terminations and are stored in external data files as one-port networks. The input and output matching networks can then be optimized separately, using a suitable microwave circuit optimization program, to achieve the required matching between the stored impedance data and the terminal 50-Omega impedances across the frequency band of interest. The microwave CAD program Touchstone has been utilized to implement this technique. As a practical implementation to the proposed design procedure, a 1-W class-C power amplifier circuit was designed and built to operate within the communication band 225-400 MHz and to achieve a power gain of 10-dB","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4133548/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9462489","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Technique for Designing Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Technique for Designing Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Putra Jaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"RFM-00-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137171S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4133533","isNumber":"4079470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133533","xplore-issue":"4079470","articleId":"4133548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4133553,"authors":[{"name":"Sharifah K.

However, peak to average power ratio (PAPR) is a major drawback in the system since this leads to the distortion problem in the linear devices such as the power amplifier (PA). Thus, the PAs require a backoff which is approximately equal to the PAPR for distortionless transmission. This decreases the efficiency for amplifiers. Hence, reducing the PAPR is the main focus of this paper. One of the available PAPR solutions is clipping. In the technique, the efficiency does not depend on the number of carriers. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the clipping technique by focusing on the performance of PAPR value with different values of clipping ratios (CRs) and the relationship between PAPR value and bit error rate (BER)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) Reduction in OFDM System","publicationTitle":"2006 International RF and Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/RFM.2006.331041","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International RF and Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4133533/4079470/04133556.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFM.2006.331041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4079470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) Reduction in OFDM System","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133556/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9462443","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) Reduction in OFDM System","confLoc":"Putra Jaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"RFM-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043862S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4133533","isNumber":"4079470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133533","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4079470","articleId":"4133556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4133558,"authors":[{"name":"N.

These signals are propagated through their own transmission channel, showing that they are coming from four different propagation transmissions.

3G in Malaysia, promises more data-enriched services at higher data rates. However, 3G cell radius is much smaller compared to GSM and thus more base stations are required to cover a comparable GSM area. Another solution to solve the coverage problem is through repeater deployment. Channel-selective repeater is one of the promising solutions offered in the market. However, one must first consider antenna isolation in order to avoid self-oscillation before installing the repeater. This paper attempts to give some introduction to repeater system with emphasis on the antenna isolation issue. Factors that affect antenna isolation are elaborated and a case study is reviewed to illustrate the antenna isolation measurement.

The technology spans from copper line digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable modem to wireless digital audio/video broadcasting (DAB/DVB) and wireless local area network (WLAN) to power-line communication (PLC) applications. The increasing number of different applications related to OFDM has produced many different methods and techniques to harness the OFDM technology. This paper has the same intention by proposing a practical hardware approach to implement packet detection and coarse symbol timing synchronization methods for packet OFDM that applies to all wire-line, wireless and PLC applications in general. Combining both methods in interdependent fashion using multi-thread state-machine control mechanism produces a very robust system when it performs under additive Gaussian white noise (AWGN) channel in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.

The travelling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) is the best candidate for high efficiency, but the linearity has to be improved by using a predistortion linearizer. The diode-bridge type linearizer followed by a limiter is the optimum approach in terms of linearization effectiveness close to saturation, stable operation in satellite environment, simple construction and high reliability. Designing and using such a linearizer with a high efficiency TWT especially developed by AEG, the achieved linearization is close to the calculated for the \"ideal\" case. Just the limiter by itself improves the multicarrier behaviour of the TWTA close to saturation. Considering all the experience obtained by the work to be described, a proposal for a multicarrier transmitter is made finally which copes with most of the demands of present and future mobile satellite communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1986.334292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1986.334292","startPage":"810","endPage":"815","displayPublicationTitle":"1986 16th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4133648/4133649/04133775.pdf","publicationTitle":"1986 16th European Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Linearized L-Band 200 Watt TWT Amplifier for Multicarrier Operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 1986","displayDocTitle":"A Linearized L-Band 200 Watt TWT Amplifier for Multicarrier Operation","conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 1986","publicationDate":"Sept. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133775/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linearized L-Band 200 Watt TWT Amplifier for Multicarrier Operation","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022656S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 1986","isNumber":"4133649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133648","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4133775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4133777,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, the performance can be limited by the non-ideality of the analog front-ends, multipath fading and the difficulty to achieve a reasonable link budget at high data rates. The goal of this paper is to introduce high rate communications in the 60 GHz band and the associated challenges. We will first introduce WPANs in the 60 GHz band, describing the possible applications, the propagation channel and the standardization context. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of the propagation channel, we will show that beamforming is desirable to boost the link budget, reduce interference and, in some cases, reduce multipath. Next, we will introduce candidate PHY layer solutions that at the same time meet the throughput requirements and relax the analog front-end design. Our solutions rely on the combination of block transmission combined with (nearly) constant envelope modulation: this provides low peak-to-average power ratios, easy equalization, good spectral properties and modest front-end requirements in terms of phase noise and ADC resolution. The receiver signal processing associated with the modulation techniques will be described and link level simulation results will be provided, highlighting the \"front-end friendliness\" of the modulation technique","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2006.334362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2006.334362","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4133785/4084710/04133793.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Air Interface and Physical Layer techniques for 60 GHz WPANs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Air Interface and Physical Layer techniques for 60 GHz WPANs","conferenceDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133793/","accessionNumber":"9453657","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133793/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Air Interface and Physical Layer techniques for 60 GHz WPANs","confLoc":"Liege, Belgium","sourcePdf":"SCVT-00-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069233S","chronDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4133785","isNumber":"4084710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133785","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4084710","articleId":"4133793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4133794,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The idea is to exploit the correlation between the OFDM symbols at neighboring sub-carriers by means of an interpolation process. We propose a new OFDM scheme that sends interpolated data vectors and reconstructs at the receiver's side the original data vectors for all sub-carriers. We have evaluated the system's performance under realistic channel conditions using two CDMA test channels. Computer simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional OFDM in terms of BER as well as in terms of noise immunity","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4133785/4084710/04133805.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"2006 Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2006.334373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2006.334373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scheme of Fractional Modulation for Wireless OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Wireless LAN","Data communication","Interpolation","System performance","Fading","Transmitters","Digital modulation","Multiaccess communication","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless OFDM","fractional modulation scheme","multicarrier transmission scheme","data transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Scheme of Fractional Modulation for Wireless OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9453669","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","conferenceDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scheme of Fractional Modulation for Wireless OFDM","confLoc":"Liege, Belgium","sourcePdf":"SCVT-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047842S","chronDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4133785","isNumber":"4084710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133785","xplore-issue":"4084710","articleId":"4133805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4133808,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Adaptive bit loading is a method to adapt the constellation size of the transmitted signal according to the channel variations by exclusion of heavily faded carriers from transmission and as a compensation higher modulation modes are allocated to subcarriers with good SNR. Windowing of OFDM signal is a spectrum pooling method for shaping the signal spectrum in order to reduce interference to neighbouring system (legacy users). In this paper different OFDM adaptive bit loading algorithms are combined with several window functions, and the bit error rate performance of the system is simulated for a wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) mobile multipath channel. The new results of this paper show how promising is the combination of bit loading algorithm and window form","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4133785/4084710/04133808.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"2006 Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/SCVT.2006.334376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCVT.2006.334376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Spectrum Pooling and Adaptive Bit Loading for Cognitive Radio OFDM Based System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Bit error rate","OFDM modulation","Adaptive systems","Equations","Robustness","Constellation diagram","Interference","Radar scattering","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","error statistics","mobile radio","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio OFDM","adaptive bit loading","spectrum pooling","cognitive radio orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel variations","signal spectrum","bit error rate","wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering","mobile multipath channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Combined Spectrum Pooling and Adaptive Bit Loading for Cognitive Radio OFDM Based System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133808/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9453672","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","conferenceDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Spectrum Pooling and Adaptive Bit Loading for Cognitive Radio OFDM Based System","confLoc":"Liege, Belgium","sourcePdf":"SCVT-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051746S","chronDate":"23-23 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4133785","isNumber":"4084710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133785","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4084710","articleId":"4133808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4133809,"authors":[{"name":"Nauman F.

We consider the case where low complexity zero-forcing receivers are employed. The analysis is simpler and more direct than the standard BICM error event expurgation technique, and yields efficient, accurate expressions for the error probability. Based on the analytical results, we obtain the diversity order and show that it is independent of the spatial correlation. Moreover, we show that the presence of spatial correlation induces an SNR loss with respect to i.i.d. channels. We quantify this loss, and show that it is a function of the antenna configuration and the eigenvalues of the spatial correlation matrices, and is independent of the coding and modulation parameters","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.05259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4133856/04133861.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.05259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133856","startPage":"787","endPage":"792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Performance of MIMO-BICM with Zero-Forcing Receivers in Spatially-Correlated Rayleigh Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error Performance of MIMO-BICM with Zero-Forcing Receivers in Spatially-Correlated Rayleigh Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9371153","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4133861/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Performance of MIMO-BICM with Zero-Forcing Receivers in Spatially-Correlated Rayleigh Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0703_787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054873S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4133856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4133856","articleId":"4133861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4133864,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292500900"},{"name":"Edward K.S.

The algorithm is based on the zero-forcing (ZF) criterion and is derived under the assumption that the number of users is equal to the number of transmit antennas. In contrast to other existing methods, it ensures the same signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at each mobile terminal so as to guarantee a fair treatment of all active users. In multimedia applications, however, several types of information with different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements must be sent simultaneously on different subchannels. Motivated by the above problem, in the present work we design a THP-based pre-filtering algorithm for multiple-antenna multi-user systems in which the base station allocates the transmit power according to the QoS requirement of each active user. Compared to existing alternatives, the proposed scheme is simpler to implement and suited for practical situations where the number of active users may be less than the number of transmit antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4133856/04133872.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Linear Pre-Coding for Multiple-Antenna Multi-User Downlink Transmissions with Different QoS Requirements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Transmitting antennas","Multiple access interference","Algorithm design and analysis","Base stations","Signal processing","Intersymbol interference","Signal processing algorithms","Matrix decomposition","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","filtering theory","mobile radio","precoding","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear precoding","multiple-antenna multi-user downlink transmissions","QoS requirements","nonlinear prefiltering technique","Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","multiple-antenna multi-user systems","zero-forcing criterion","transmit antennas","signal-to-noise-ratio","mobile terminal","quality-of-service requirements","THP-based prefiltering algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Non-Linear Pre-Coding for Multiple-Antenna Multi-User Downlink Transmissions with Different QoS Requirements","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4133872/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9371164","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Linear Pre-Coding for Multiple-Antenna Multi-User Downlink Transmissions with Different QoS Requirements","sourcePdf":"tw_0703_852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067475S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4133856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4133856","articleId":"4133872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4133873,"authors":[{"name":"Volkan Rodoplu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4133856/4133873/4133873-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Volkan Rodoplu received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 1996 and his M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1998.

For a fixed network size, a finite number of information bits is delivered for each source-destination pair, under a fixed end-to-end probability of error constraint. We prove that under the one-to-one traffic model in which every node wants to send traffic to a randomly chosen destination node, the bits-per-Joule capacity of a stationary wireless network grows asymptotically as Omega((N/logN)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(q-1)/2 </sup>\n), where N is the number of nodes randomly deployed onto the surface of a sphere and q is the path loss exponent. Further, the length of the block codes used grows only logarithmically in N, which indicates manageable decoder complexity as the network scales. The fact that the bits-per-Joule capacity grows with the number of nodes contrasts sharply with the scaling laws that have been derived for throughput capacity and implies that large-scale deployments for energy-limited sensor and ad hoc networks may be suitable for delay-tolerant data applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4133856/04133873.pdf","startPage":"857","endPage":"865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bits-per-Joule Capacity of Energy-Limited Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Throughput","Wireless sensor networks","Capacitive sensors","Ad hoc networks","Energy measurement","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Block codes","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","block codes","decoding","error statistics","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bits-per-Joule capacity","energy-limited wireless networks","network capacity","source-destination pair","fixed end-to-end error probability constraint","one-to-one traffic model","stationary wireless network","path loss exponent","block codes","decoder complexity","throughput capacity","energy-limited sensor","ad hoc networks","delay-tolerant data applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Bits-per-Joule Capacity of Energy-Limited Wireless Networks","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4133873/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9371165","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bits-per-Joule Capacity of Energy-Limited Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0703_857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080489S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4133856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4133856","articleId":"4133873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4133876,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, USA","Communication Science Institute, University of Southern California, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4133856/4133876/4133876-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenyi Zhang S'OO.

This paper introduces the concept of a guard zone, defined as the region around each receiver where interfering transmissions are inhibited. Using stochastic geometry, the guard zone size that maximizes the transmission capacity for spread spectrum ad hoc networks is derived - narrowband transmission (spreading gain of unity) is a special case. A large guard zone naturally decreases the interference, but at the cost of inefficient spatial reuse. The derived results provide insight into the design of contention resolution algorithms by quantifying the optimal tradeoff between interference and spatial reuse in terms of the system parameters. A capacity increase relative to random access (ALOHA) in the range of 2 - 100 fold is demonstrated through an optimal guard zone; the capacity increase depending primarily on the required outage probability, as higher required QoS increasingly rewards scheduling. Compared to the ubiquitous carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) which essentially implements a guard zone around the transmitter rather than the receiver - we observe a capacity increase on the order of 30 - 100%","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.04793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4133856/04133877.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.04793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Guard Zone in Wireless Ad hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133877/","displayDocTitle":"The Guard Zone in Wireless Ad hoc Networks","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9371169","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133877/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Guard Zone in Wireless Ad hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0703_897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127533S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4133856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"4133856","articleId":"4133877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4133878,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Therefore, conventional maximum average signal-to-noise ratio beamforming (BF) or maximal-ratio combining (MRC) may not necessarily be effective in terms of performance or signal processing complexity. A newer, more flexible, approach, called maximal-ratio eigen-combining (MREC) is analyzed and found to generalize BF and MRC. For imperfectly-known channels we study both suboptimal and optimal eigen-/combining. MREC-based analysis is shown to simplify MRC performance investigations for correlated channel gains. For MPSK signals, we present average error probability (AEP) expressions for MREC, BF, and MRC, that are new or generalizations of our previous work. Furthermore, we propose a performance-complexity tradeoff criterion (PCTC) for MREC-receiver adaptation to changing AS.

If and only if the fading channel coefficients satisfy this condition, the relay transmits the signals to the destination; otherwise, the relay will stay in the idle state. For a system with more than one relay node, general closed-form power allocation solutions based on an exact SNR expression are difficult to derive; we hence, calculate a SNR upper bound and derive a sub-optimum power allocation solution based on this bound.

To reduce the complexity induced by the DFT/IDFT processing, symbol based beamforming was recently proposed with only one IDFT block at the transmitter and one DFT block at the receiver. However, this approach results in a significant performance loss especially when the number of distinct paths in the channel is large. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage beamforming (MSB) scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems employing both the principles of subcarrier level beamforming and symbol level beamforming to effectively tradeoff system performance and complexity. Using the proposed MSB scheme and with a little complexity increase compared with the symbol based beamforming, system performance can be significantly improved. Under some channel conditions, the proposed MSB scheme can achieve a performance close to the optimal subcarrier based beamforming scheme but with much lower complexity. For the MSB scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the symbol level and subcarrier level weighting coefficients. To reduce the complexity of the joint weighting coefficients calculation algorithm, we propose a reduced complexity algorithm to first obtain the symbol level weighting coefficients and then the subcarrier level weighting coefficients. Simulation results show that good performance can be achieved using the proposed weighting coefficients calculation algorithms with reasonable complexity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4133856/04133883.pdf","startPage":"959","endPage":"969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Stage Beamforming for Coded OFDM with Multiple Transmit and Multiple Receive Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Discrete Fourier transforms","System performance","MIMO","Iterative algorithms","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","discrete Fourier transforms","iterative methods","MIMO communication","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistage beamforming","coded OFDM","multiple transmit antennas","multiple receive antennas","subcarrier based beamforming","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MIMO channels","multiple-input and multiple-output channels","inverse DFT","discrete Fourier transform","symbol based beamforming","iterative algorithm","symbol level weighting coefficients","subcarrier level weighting coefficients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Stage Beamforming for Coded OFDM with Multiple Transmit and Multiple Receive Antennas","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4133883/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9371175","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Stage Beamforming for Coded OFDM with Multiple Transmit and Multiple Receive Antennas","sourcePdf":"tw_0703_959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12621S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4133856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4133856","articleId":"4133883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4133884,"authors":[{"name":"Cecilia Carbonelli","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Munich, Germany","Ming-Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, Viterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4133856/4133884/4133884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cecilia Carbonelli (S'01-M'06) received the Laurea degree (cum laude) in Telecommunications Engineering and the Ph.

However, such capture can be dependent on the accuracy of channel estimation, which is the problem considered herein. Strategies that exploit properties of the UWB channel can offer performance improvement over schemes which are less parametric. To this end, recent UWB propagation studies and associated channel modelling suggest that clustering occurs in both space and time for indoor wireless office/laboratory environments. Motivated by this study, a two-stage channel estimation scheme is proposed. First, coarse channel estimation is conducted which estimates the location and dispersion of a cluster around this location. Then, channel estimation efforts are localized around the nominal location to reduce the dimensionality of the estimation of the parameters associated with the different multipath components. For cluster estimation, methods based on maximum-likelihood and correlation matrix fitting are considered. Different strategies are presented for multipath estimation, based on the expectation maximization algorithm and correlator output maximization.

Multi-mode precoding uses linear transmit precoding that adapts the number of spatial multiplexing data streams or modes, according to the transmit channel state information (CSI). As such, it typically requires complete knowledge of the multi-mode precoding matrices for each subcarrier at the transmitter. In practical scenarios where the CSI is acquired at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter through a low-rate feedback link, this requirement may entail a prohibitive feedback overhead. In this paper, we propose to reduce the feedback requirement by combining codebook-based precoder quantization, to efficiently quantize and represent the optimal precoder on each subcarrier, and multi-mode precoder frequency down-sampling and interpolation, to efficiently reconstruct the precoding matrices on all subcarriers based on the feedback of the indexes of the quantized precoders only on a fraction of the subcarriers. To enable this efficient interpolation-based quantized multimode precoding solution, we introduce (1) a novel precoder codebook design that lends itself to precoder interpolation, across subcarriers, followed by mode selection, (2) a new precoder interpolator and, finally, (3) a clustered mode selection approach that significantly reduces the feedback overhead related to the mode information on each subcarrier.

The first M of MM stands for majorize (minorize) and the second M stands for minimization (maximization). To construct an EM-type algorithm, specifying the complete data, computing the conditional expectation and maximizing the conditional expectation analytically are skillful and computationally complex.

We start with investigating network models with single-input-single-output (SISO) links. For threshold-T based multicast policies, we characterize the optimal transmission rates that maximize the throughput in stable networks and in saturated networks, respectively. We investigate the tradeoff between stability and throughput therein. We then generalize our study to network models with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) links and non-i.i.d. channel links, and investigate the optimal transmission rate. In addition, to ensure multicast reliability while no retransmission is required at the MAC layer, we propose to use transport layer erasure coding for reliability enhancement, where the problem boils down to jointly optimizing the transmission rate and the multicast threshold.

We present two algorithms. The first is suboptimal, but provides a simple closed-form precoder that handles the case of uncorrelated transmitters, correlated receivers.

This is slightly different from the traditional interference channel problem which assumes that transmitters cooperate in their respective coding strategies, and that interference cancellation can be performed at the receivers. In this noncooperative setup, greedy capacity optimization by individual transmitters through various algorithms leads to simultaneous water filling fixed points where the spectrum of the transmit covariance matrix of one user water fills over the spectrum of its corresponding interference-plus-noise covariance matrix, and in our paper we study the properties of these fixed points. We show that at a simultaneous water filling point the eigenvectors of transmit covariance matrices at each receiver are aligned, and identify three regimes which correspond to simultaneous water filling that depend on the interference gains: a) complete spectral overlap, b) partial spectral overlap, and c) spectral segregation. These imply that the transmit covariance matrices will be white in regions of both overlap and segregation, but not necessarily white overall. We also consider performance as a function of interference gain and show that complete spectral overlap is a strongly suboptimal solution over a wide range of gains. Overall, our results suggest that for strong mutual interference, an effort should be made to do joint decoding over receivers since such collaboration can provide large capacity increases. For moderate interference, distributed and/or centralized conflict resolution algorithms would be most effective since more complex collaborative methods do not afford much improvement and strictly greedy methods such as water filling perform poorly, while for weak interference a laissez faire approach seems reasonable","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.05464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4133856/04133897.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.05464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"1102","endPage":"1113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Water Filling in Mutually Interfering Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Water Filling in Mutually Interfering Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133897/","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4133897/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9371189","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Water Filling in Mutually Interfering Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0703_1102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080897S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4133856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4133856","articleId":"4133897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4133905,"authors":[{"name":"Sangbum Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangbum","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291915800"},{"name":"Daehyoung Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daehyoung","lastName":"Hong","id":"37289203600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4133905","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":92},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Optimal scheduling","Throughput","Scheduling algorithm","Resource management","Base stations","Web and internet services","Adaptive scheduling","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","nonlinear programming","packet radio networks","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA packet system downlink","code-division multiple access","multiuser fair scheduling algorithm","adaptive modulation-coding","AMC","multicodes","mixed-integer nonlinear programming","radio resource assignment"]}],"abstract":"A fair scheduling algorithm is proposed to improve the system throughput while maintaining the fairness in the downlink of a code-division multiple access (CDMA) system employing AMC and multicodes.

However, the accuracy of that upper bound is questionable since the possibility of power control (PC) infeasibility has not been taken into consideration. Also, the analysis used the normal distribution to model SINR instead of the widely-accepted lognormal distribution. Moreover, the noise and the inter-cell interference were ignored. In this letter, we derive a more accurate upper bound by taking the possibility of PC infeasibility into consideration and by using the lognormal distribution of SINR for imperfect PC. In addition, our analysis takes the noise and the inter-cell interference into account","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2007.061696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4133902/04133915.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2007.061696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Upper Bound of SINR-based Call Admission Threshold in CDMA Systems with Imperfect Power Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133915/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Upper Bound of SINR-based Call Admission Threshold in CDMA Systems with Imperfect Power Control","volume":"11","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9368531","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4133915/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Upper Bound of SINR-based Call Admission Threshold in CDMA Systems with Imperfect Power Control","sourcePdf":"cl_0703_258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038305S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4133902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4133902","articleId":"4133915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4133916,"authors":[{"name":"Aggelos Bletsas","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Aggelos","lastName":"Bletsas","id":"37295046900"},{"name":"Hyundong Shin","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyundong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37287623300"},{"name":"Moe Z.

The gradient projection algorithm is then used for searching for a valid codeword that lies in the vicinity of the channel observation. The computational complexity of the new decoding technique is practically sub-linearly dependent on the code's length, while processing on each variable node can be performed in parallel allowing very low decoding latencies.

The proposed technique improves the efficiency of face recognition, under varying illumination and expression conditions for face images when compared to traditional PCA techniques. In this algorithm the face images are divided into smaller sub-images called modules and a series of Gabor wavelets at different scales and orientations are applied on these localized modules for feature extraction. A modified PCA approach is then applied for dimensionality reduction. Due to the extraction of localized features using Gabor wavelets, the proposed algorithm is expected to give improved recognition rate when compared to other traditional techniques. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated under conditions of varying illumination, expression and variation in pose up to a certain range using standard face databases.","doi":"10.1109/AIPR.2006.24","publicationTitle":"35th IEEE Applied Imagery and Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"35th IEEE Applied Imagery and Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4133936/4133937/04133955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIPR.2006.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4133937","startPage":"13","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gabor Wavelet Based Modular PCA Approach for Expression and Illumination Invariant Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4133955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gabor Wavelet Based Modular PCA Approach for Expression and Illumination Invariant Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4133955/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10284352","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4133955/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gabor Wavelet Based Modular PCA Approach for Expression and Illumination Invariant Face Recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"27390013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103269S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4133936","isNumber":"4133937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4133936","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4133937","articleId":"4133955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4133992,"authors":[{"name":"Duncan Buell","affiliation":["University of South Carolina, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Duncan Buell is a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Carolina, Columbia.

For such cases, these algorithms either provide rough estimates or resort to unefficient and therefore costly enumeration strategies.

To obtain optimized parameters for the future designs, various pump configurations with different geometries were simulated through FLUENT, and the characteristics of the gas-actuated micro-jet pump was studied experimentally.

The technique is based on transmitting multiple sequences for each user over the same channel.

We show that when the number of subcarriers is quite high (e.g. 256), the system converges to within 0.5 dB of the ML algorithm with a maximum of three iterations in channels with normalized Doppler of 0.02 and with a very slow pilot repetition rate.

Balasa et al. proposed a method of obtaining the closest placement that satisfies the given symmetry constraints and the topology constraints imposed by a sequence-pair (seq-pair). However, this method has the following defects: 1) Balasa's necessary condition for existence of the cell placement that satisfies the given constraints is incorrect; 2) some cells overlap; 3) the closest placement of satisfying both the symmetry and topology constraints is not always obtained; and 4) there is no explanation of placing cells symmetrically to plural axes. In this paper, we clarify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the cell placement that satisfies the given symmetry constraints and the topology constraints imposed by a seq-pair, and we propose an efficient method of obtaining, by linear programming, the closest cell placement that satisfies the given constraints. Here, a simple constraint graph is obtained from a seq-pair in order to derive a set of linear constraint expressions. Then, to shorten the running time of linear programming, the number of linear expressions is reduced by substituting the expressions for dependent variables, and the solution is obtained.

Designers must indeed account for numerous new factors that impose a drastic change in validation and physical-verification methods. One of these major changes in timing verification to handle process variation lies in the progressive development of statistical static-timing engines. However, the statistical approach cannot capture accurately the deterministic variations of both the voltage and temperature variations. Therefore, we define a novel method, based on nonlinear-derating coefficients, to account for these environmental variations. Based on temperature- and voltage-drop computer-aided-design tool reports, this method allows computing the propagation delay of logical paths considering the operating conditions of each cell.

First, we consider the temperature constrained T-via planning (TVP) problem on a given 3-D floorplan. Second, we integrate dynamic TVP into 3-D floorplanning process. Our main contribution and results can be summarized as follows. We solve the temperature constrained TVP problem by solving a sequence of simplified interlayer and intralayer TVP subproblems. Each subproblem is formulated as convex programming problem and we derive nearly optimal solution for detailed T-via distribution. Based on the TVP solution, we implement the integrated TVP and 3-D floorplanning algorithm in a two-stage approach. Before floorplanning, blocks are assigned into different layers by solving a sequence of knapsack problems. During floorplanning, T-vias are allocated with white space redistribution to optimize T-via insertion. Experimental results show that our TVP approach can reduce T-vias by 12% compared with a recent published work (J. Cong and Y. Zhang, \"Thermal via planning for 3-D ICs,\" in Proc. Int. Conf. Comput.-Aided Des., Nov. 2005, pp.745-752).

Recent progress in statistical static-timing analysis also makes the extraction important for modern chip designs. Existing approaches extract either only a deterministic component of spatial variation or these approaches do not consider the actual difficulties in computing a valid spatial-correlation function, ignoring the fact that not every function and matrix can be used to describe the spatial correlation. Applying mathematical theories from random fields and convex analysis, we develop: 1) a robust technique to extract a valid spatial-correlation function by solving a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and 2) a robust technique to extract a valid spatial-correlation matrix by employing a modified alternative-projection algorithm. Our novel techniques guarantee to extract a valid spatial-correlation function and matrix from measurement data, even if those measurements are affected by unavoidable random noises.

However, the implicit connection graph has a higher degree of routing graph complexity. In this paper, a new multilayer implicit-connection-graph-based gridless router called NEMO is developed. Unlike the first implicit-connection-graph-based router that embeds all routing layers onto a routing plane, NEMO constructs a routing plane for each routing layer. Additionally, each routing plane comprises tiles, not an array of grid points with their connecting edges, and consequently, the complexity of the routing problem decreases. Each grid point then represents exactly one tile or its left-bottom corner such that a tile query is equivalent to any point query inside the queried tile, and a grid maze becomes tile propagation. Furthermore, to accelerate path search, continuous space tiles are combined as a pseudo maximum horizontally or vertically stripped tile. Experimental results reveal that NEMO conducts a point-to-point path search around ten times faster than the implicit-connection-graph-based router. General-purpose routing by NEMO also improves routing performance by approximately 1.69times-55.82 times, as compared to previously published works based on a set of commonly used MCNC benchmark circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NEMO: A New Implicit-Connection-Graph-Based Gridless Router With Multilayer Planes and Pseudo Tile Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2007.891381","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4135360/04135381.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2007.891381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4135360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4135381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4135381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"NEMO: A New Implicit-Connection-Graph-Based Gridless Router With Multilayer Planes and Pseudo Tile Propagation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4135381/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9367010","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NEMO: A New Implicit-Connection-Graph-Based Gridless Router With Multilayer Planes and Pseudo Tile Propagation","sourcePdf":"26tcad04-ylli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092956S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4135360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4135360","articleId":"4135381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4135415,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Casadei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4118385/4135415/4135415-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Domenico Casadei (M'98\u2013A'01\u2013SM'04) received the \u201cLaurea\u201d degree (with honors) in electrical engineering from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 1974.","He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bologna, in 1975, where he is currently a Professor of electrical drives.

This paper explores the resistive output impedance of the parallel-connected inverters in an island microgrid. The control loops are devised and analyzed, taking into account the special nature of a low-voltage microgrid, in which the line impedance is mainly resistive and the distance between the inverters makes the control intercommunication between them difficult. In contrast with the conventional droop-control method, the proposed controller uses resistive output impedance, and as a result, a different control law is obtained. The controller is implemented by using a digital signal processor board, which only uses local measurements of the unit, thus increasing the modularity, reliability, and flexibility of the distributed system. Experimental results are provided from two 6-kVA inverters connected in parallel, showing the features of the proposed wireless control","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.892621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4118385/04135419.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"1004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.892621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Control for Parallel Operation of Distributed Generation Inverters Using Resistive Output Impedance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4135419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Control for Parallel Operation of Distributed Generation Inverters Using Resistive Output Impedance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4135419/","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9400448","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4135419/","volume":"54","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Control for Parallel Operation of Distributed Generation Inverters Using Resistive Output Impedance","sourcePdf":"54tie02-guerrero.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086021S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4118385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"770","xplore-issue":"4118385","articleId":"4135419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4135421,"authors":[{"name":"Matti Karppanen","affiliation":["The Institute of Power Electronics, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4118385/4135421/4135421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matti Karppanen was born in Kajaani, Finland, in 1982.

The method in itself is well known from the 1980s, but the dynamical features that the method would provide have not been fully investigated and reported. The results of the investigations made in this paper show that the IVFF control would provide input-noise attenuation comparable to the peak-current-mode control, voltage-loop gain largely independent of input voltage, and highly reduced input-filter interactions as compared to the voltage-mode control. The main disadvantage is the reduced output-voltage-load-transient response due to the input-voltage-dependent maximum duty ratio.

The monitoring of the health state of a power network is therefore becoming an essential issue. Although conventional techniques like discrete Fourier transform or fast Fourier transform are still widely applied in industry, some limitations arise particularly under supply frequency drift and transient circumstances. The proposed iterative-loop approaching algorithm can respond to the supply frequency variation, the fundamental amplitude/phase variation, as well as the harmonics frequency amplitude/phase variation instantly and accurately. Furthermore, an abrupt change of fundamental frequency and amplitude can also be traced properly and promptly.

It is important for the multi-beam mobile satellite communications system using the MPA to reduce the signal interference in the adjacent beam overlap area and to reduce intermodulation distortion (IMD) caused by multi-carrier amplification. In an MPA, high output port isolation and low IMD are achieved by a novel combination of high power amplifier (HPA) arrangement and a demultiplexer/multiplexer configuration.

Exploiting the L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n metric structure, the number of unknown variables in EMD-L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n is reduced to O(N) from O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) of the original EMD for a histogram with N bins. In addition, the number of constraints is reduced by half and the objective function of the linear program is simplified. Formally, without any approximation, we prove that the EMD-L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n formulation is equivalent to the original EMD with a L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n ground distance. To perform the EMD-L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n computation, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm, Tree-EMD. Tree-EMD exploits the fact that a basic feasible solution of the simplex algorithm-based solver forms a spanning tree when we interpret EMD-L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n as a network flow optimization problem. We empirically show that this new algorithm has an average time complexity of O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), which significantly improves the best reported supercubic complexity of the original EMD. The accuracy of the proposed methods is evaluated by experiments for two computation-intensive problems: shape recognition and interest point matching using multidimensional histogram-based local features. For shape recognition, EMD-L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n is applied to compare shape contexts on the widely tested MPEG7 shape data set, as well as an articulated shape data set. For interest point matching, SIFT, shape context and spin image are tested on both synthetic and real image pairs with large geometrical deformation, illumination change, and heavy intensity noise. The results demonstrate that our EMD-L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-based solutions outperform previously reported state-of-the-art features and distance measures in solving the two tasks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4135669/04135678.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4135669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4135678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Earth Mover's Distance Algorithm for Robust Histogram Comparison","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earth","Robustness","Histograms","Shape","Testing","Linear programming","Multidimensional systems","MPEG 7 Standard","Lighting","Noise shaping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","image matching","linear programming","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earth movers distance","linear programming formulation","tree-based algorithm","network flow optimization problem","time complexity","supercubic complexity","computation-intensive problems","shape recognition","interest point matching","multidimensional histogram-based local features","shape context","spin image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Earth Mover's Distance","transportation problem","histogram-based descriptor","SIFT","shape context","spin image","shape matching","interest point matching."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Statistical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4135678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Earth Mover's Distance Algorithm for Robust Histogram Comparison","volume":"29","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4135678/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9392469","pubMedId":"17356203","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Earth Mover's Distance Algorithm for Robust Histogram Comparison","sourcePdf":"i0840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055506S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"4135669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"241","articleId":"4135678","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4135679,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Torralba","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4135669/4135679/4135679-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Torralba is a research scientist in the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4135679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9392470","pubMedId":"17356204","htmlLink":"/document/4135679/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sharing Visual Features for Multiclass and Multiview Object Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sharing Visual Features for Multiclass and Multiview Object Detection","sourcePdf":"i0854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089702S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4135669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"449","xplore-issue":"4135669","articleId":"4135679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4135685,"authors":[{"name":"Jayadeva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"lastName":"Jayadeva","id":"37266770600"},{"name":"R.

In particular, the possibility of exciting two degenerate resonances on a single ring has already been established. In the technical literature, however, one can not find (to the authors knowledge) a complete and detailed description of actual microwave filters implemented by explicitly using the dual-mode nature of the microstrip ring. In this paper we present computer simulations and measured results describing a dual-mode filter cell implemented by using a single microstrip ring resonator. The microstrip dual-mode filter presented allows the implementation of two transmission poles and two transmission zeros using only one dual-mode ring resonator. This result is of particular interest because it has already been demonstrated experimentally that a similar behavior can be also obtained with circular-waveguide resonators. The presence or the absence of the transmission zeros is explained in simple terms. In addition, a procedure is presented to predict the position in frequency of the transmission zeros.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 1990","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Investigation of Dual-Mode Microstrip Ring Resonators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Investigation of Dual-Mode Microstrip Ring Resonators","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"EUMA-1-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026895S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 1990","isNumber":"4135976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4135975","citationCount":"41","articleId":"4136114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4136126,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Weiss","affiliation":["Center for Space Terahertz Technology & Center for High Frequency Microelectronics, Solid State Electronics Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37286283200"},{"name":"Geok Ing Ng","affiliation":["Center for Space Terahertz Technology & Center for High Frequency Microelectronics, Solid State Electronics Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2122"],"firstName":"Geok Ing","lastName":"Ng","id":"37287266500"},{"name":"Dimitris Pavlidis","affiliation":["Center for Space Terahertz Technology & Center for High Frequency Microelectronics, Solid State Electronics Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Pavlidis","id":"37266737200"}],"articleNumber":"4136126","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4136126","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indium phosphide","HEMTs","Frequency","Indium gallium arsenide","Indium compounds","Gain","Gallium arsenide","Substrates","Composite materials","Degradation"]}],"abstract":"Experimental results on InP based In0.53+xGa0.47-xAs/In0.52Al0.48As HEMT monolithic integrated amplifiers are reported demonstrating the feasibility of this technology.

Each of the K different users may access an M-ary symbol alphabet. Therefore, some sort of multiple access principle must be implemented. To date, in the second generation mobile telecommunication system (GSM) FDMA and TDMA are used. CDMA and spread spectrum techniques are ideal means to combat time-variant multipath channels. There are further advantages over FDMA and TDMA like graceful degradation and reduced timing organization as well as the possibility of position location. With respect to a novel coherent multiple transmission (CMT) and reception (CMR) scheme a considerable gain can be achieved when using CDMA and spread spectrum and at the same time the carrier-to-interference ratio will be noticeably reduced. In this paper we shall emphasize the potential of CDMA and spread spectrum techniques in an illustrative way without going into technical details.","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1991.336337","publicationTitle":"1991 21st European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 21st European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4136268/4136269/04136321.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1991.336337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4136269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDMA and Spread Spectrum Techniques Versus FDMA and TDMA in Cellular Mobile Radio Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4136321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136321/","displayDocTitle":"CDMA and Spread Spectrum Techniques Versus FDMA and TDMA in Cellular Mobile Radio Applications","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDMA and Spread Spectrum Techniques Versus FDMA and TDMA in Cellular Mobile Radio Applications","confLoc":"Stuttgart, Germany","sourcePdf":"EUMA-1-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072136S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 1991","isNumber":"4136269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4136268","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4136321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4136343,"authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth M.

By employing coherent optical processing in guided-wave optical components, and with extensive use of optoelectronic integrated circuits, substantial reductions in mass and power are feasible in comparison with conventional beamformers. In a major study for European Space Agency, reductions of 30% and power reductions of 60% were seen to be feasible in a complex beamformer for a space-borne communications antenna, relative to a MMIC-based system with the same performance requirements. In order to verify the system concept, we designed and constructed a complete proof of concept model (PCM) offering both transmit and receive mode operation in the 12 GHz band. Detailed performance evaluation has been carried out, resulting in the first practical demonstration of the application of coherent optical techniques in an antenna beamformer. In this paper we discuss the optoelectronic beamforming concept, the application of this concept to a specific antenna and the design and construction of the proof of concept model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Coherent optical beomforming techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent optical beomforming techniques","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043024S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"4136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4136511","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4136528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4136530,"authors":[{"name":"David B.

We carry out simulations based on a linear array with K elements, where each element is followed by a tapped delay-line with L taps.

We present a bandwidth controllable signal and interference model for carrying out simulations and discuss the method for choosing the frequencies to obtain a distortionless response. Graphs showing array gain and interference attenuation versus INR (interferenceto-noise ratio ) are given, which show the feature of adaptive rejection of interference. Theoretically we prove that any full rank transform between tap samples and weights is not able to improve the bandwidth performance of MVDR.

It is a versatile tool with very rich mathematical content and great potential for application. Because of this localized property both in the original and in the transform domain it is expected that its application to the numerical solution of partial differential equations would be quite interesting for electromagnetic field problems. In this paper this concept is explained with application to one dimension (ID) and two dimensions (2D) differential equations. Numerical examples have been presented showing the features of the method.","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 23rd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4136511/4136512/04136547.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"1993 23rd European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1993.336809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1993.336809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4136512","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4136547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilization of wavelet concepts into the finite element method for efficient solution of Maxwell's equations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Maxwell equations","Sparse matrices","Matrix decomposition","Boundary conditions","Differential equations","Finite difference methods","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Poisson equations","Telecommunications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Utilization of wavelet concepts into the finite element method for efficient solution of Maxwell's equations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilization of wavelet concepts into the finite element method for efficient solution of Maxwell's equations","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024505S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"4136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4136511","articleId":"4136547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4136552,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The first MMIC is based on AlGaAs/GaAs HEMT devices with a gate length of 0.25\u03bcm. The second MMIC is realized with 0.25\u03bcm InAlAs/InGaAs HEMT devices on InP. Both of the applied types of transistors, the GaAs and the InP HEMT are characterized by a similar lateral layout. Therefore the idea has been investigated of making use of the identical circuit layout in both applications, the GaAs as well as the InP MMIC. Measurements demonstrate a gain of 18dB and 29dB for the GaAs and the InP amplifier, respectively. This increase of 11dB in gain confirms the benefit of the idea to just replace GaAs HEMT devices by InP based HEMTs in the same circuit layout. Especially in the case of MMICs in CPW technique the advantage of increased transconductance and reduced feedback capacitance of the InP HEMTs compared to their GaAs counterparts is achievable without any restriction concerning the circuit realization and chip handling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"InP based high gain Ka-band three stage coplanar waveguide monolithic amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"InP based high gain Ka-band three stage coplanar waveguide monolithic amplifier","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033574S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"4136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4136511","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4136553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4136554,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Hanke","affiliation":[" Research Institute, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Hanke","id":"37299762400"}],"articleNumber":"4136554","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave circuits","Optical fiber communication","Bit rate","Plugs","Couplers","Clocks","Coaxial components","Packaging","Microstrip"]}],"abstract":"Experimental multi-Gbit/s systems up to 20 Gbit/s have been developed and tested in the Research Institute of Deutsche Bundespost Telekom.

In multicarrier systems, the signal entering a broadband amplifier is quite different from the superposition of two tones. It is much more similar to a Gaussian distributed noise and then, the goal must be to reduce the intermodulation produced in the presence of this kind of signals. In this paper, a formula for determining the signal to intermodulation ratio for gaussian inputs from the response to a single tone is obtained based on the theory of the Random Input Describing Function. Then, a new criterium for the design of linearized ampliflers is proposed. It is also shown that minimizing this S/I ratio is not equivalent to optimize the two-tones intermodulation due to the different behaviour of the signals in the time domain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Gaussian distribution","Broadband amplifiers","Frequency","Radar applications","Telecommunications","Noise reduction","Gaussian noise","Histograms","Probability density function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1993.336596","publicationTitle":"1993 23rd European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 23rd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4136511/4136512/04136657.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4136512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1993.336596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of active feedback linearized amplifiers for multicarrier applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4136657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of active feedback linearized amplifiers for multicarrier applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136657/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of active feedback linearized amplifiers for multicarrier applications","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023474S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"4136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4136511","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4136657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4136666,"authors":[{"name":"G.

So far, the method presents such disadvantages as the volume of computation involved and lack of analytical insight. It is possible, however, to recover equivalent circuits, which are prerequisites to effective CAD and synthesis, by the proper use of FD-TD analysis. In this contribution we show the power of the method in treating two classical problems, namely, the circuit modelling of the inductive-capacitive screw and that of the inductive rectangular post in classical waveguide. We then synthesize two actual filters by FDTD methods alone and compare the results obtained with previous ones showing the effectiveness of the approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 23rd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4136511/4136512/04136725.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"669","publicationTitle":"1993 23rd European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1993.336664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1993.336664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4136512","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4136725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit modelling of wcaveguide discontinuities by FDTD methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Electromagnetic waveguides","Circuit synthesis","Waveguide components","Waveguide discontinuities","Electromagnetic scattering","Boundary conditions","Electromagnetic analysis","Information analysis","Equivalent circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Circuit modelling of wcaveguide discontinuities by FDTD methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit modelling of wcaveguide discontinuities by FDTD methods","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041527S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"4136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4136511","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4136725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4136728,"authors":[{"name":"W.

However, when applied to open region problems, the termination of the mesh at the finite distance from the object generally poses problems. In this work, while utilizing the finite element technique to open region problems, the mesh is terminated close to the object using a truncation condition based on MEI (Measured Equation Invariance) concept. The MEI concept is based on the integral equation solution approach using Green's functions which automatically enforce the radiation condition. Utilizing this novel approach leads to an increased computational efficiency of the finite element method. The major advantages of the present scheme are significant reduction in the number of unknowns yet retaining the sparsity of the generating matrix. Typical numerical results are presented for the solution of Laplace's Equation to illustrate the accuracy of the technique.","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1993.336675","publicationTitle":"1993 23rd European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 23rd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4136511/4136512/04136736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1993.336675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4136512","startPage":"696","endPage":"697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel method of applying finite element method to open region problems: Electrostatic case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4136736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel method of applying finite element method to open region problems: Electrostatic case","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136736/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method of applying finite element method to open region problems: Electrostatic case","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"EUMA-00-224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058785S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"4136512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4136511","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4136736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4136741,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A key challenge in designing futuristic one-controlling-many systems will be minimizing periods of excessive operator workload that can arise when critical tasks for several UVs occur simultaneously. To a certain degree, you can predict and mitigate such periods in advance. However, actions that mitigate a particular period of high workload in the short term might create long-term episodes of high workload that were previously nonexistent. So, we need decision support that helps an operator evaluate alternative actions for managing a mission schedule in real time. To this end, we present an iterative design cycle that tries to leverage intelligent, predictive aiding together with human judgment and pattern recognition to maximize both system and human performance in the supervision of four UAVs. Automated decision support tools that provide more local, as opposed to global, visual recommendations can produce better performance in multiple UAV scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent vehicles","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Humans","Testing","Payloads","Job shop scheduling","Remotely operated vehicles","Supervisory control","Navigation","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","intelligent control","remotely operated vehicles","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operator performance","intelligent predictive aiding","unmanned aerial vehicle scheduling","operator workload","iterative design cycle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visualization","interactive systems","intelligent aiding","unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4136859","doi":"10.1109/MIS.2007.39","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/9670/4136845/04136859.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIS.2007.39","startPage":"52","endPage":"59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4136845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operator Performance and Intelligent Aiding in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Operator Performance and Intelligent Aiding in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Scheduling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4136859/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4136859/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"March-April 2007","accessionNumber":"9445529","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operator Performance and Intelligent Aiding in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Scheduling","sourcePdf":"x2052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063255S","chronDate":"March-April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"9670","isNumber":"4136845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9670","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4136845","articleId":"4136859","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4136862,"authors":[{"name":"Ka-Ling Fok","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9670/4136845/4136862/4136862-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ka-Ling Fok is a MPhil student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

We have shown that how one can improve the performance of image retrieval systems by assuming two attributes. Firstly, images that user needs through query image are similar to a group of images with same conception. Secondly, there exists non-linear relationship between feature vectors of different images and can be exploited very efficiently with the use of support vector machines. At first level, for low level feature extraction we have used dual tree complex wavelet transform because recently it is proven to be one of the best for texture based features. At second level to extract semantic concepts, we grouped images of typical texture classes with the use of one against all support vector machines.

In this paper, we analyze the performance of a nonuniform discrete multitone (DMT) transceiver, having a Daubechies wavelet filter bank transmultiplexer used to reduce the increase in channel-noise. It is shown that for a non-ideal channel, the transceiver's bit error rate (BER) can significantly deteriorate due to inter-channel crosstalk. We also propose a modification by reducing the symbol rate in the sub-band having the maximum number of channel samples of lower magnitude.

In general, routing protocols for MANETs are designed based on the assumption that all participating nodes are fully cooperative. However, due to the open structure and scarcely available battery-based energy, node misbehaviors may exist. One such routing misbehavior is that some selfish nodes will participate in the route discovery and maintenance processes but refuse to forward data packets. In this paper, we propose the 2ACK scheme that serves as an add-on technique for routing schemes to detect routing misbehavior and to mitigate their adverse effect. The main idea of the 2ACK scheme is to send two-hop acknowledgment packets in the opposite direction of the routing path. In order to reduce additional routing overhead, only a fraction of the received data packets are acknowledged in the 2ACK scheme.

Investigations into the causes of many timing problems cannot be satisfactorily undertaken using external equipment due to its remoteness from the source of the potential problem; this necessitates the development of on-chip time measurement circuitry. Current techniques have the capability of resolving timing differences down to 5ps [1], however further improvement is impeded by process variations. This paper describes a flash Time to Digital Converter (TDC) suitable for on-chip implementation. The theory to overcome the effects of process variations, potentially permitting the time resolution down to one picosecond is described. Proof of concept is demonstrated by implementing the techniques in an FPGA, improving on the current resolution of FPGA implementation of a TDC.","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4137015/4137016/04137042.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC'07)","doi":"10.1109/ASYNC.2007.7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2007.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137016","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Resolution Flash Time-to-Digital Converter Taking Into Account Process Variability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Timing","Clocks","Synchronization","Asynchronous circuits","Time measurement","Jitter","Metastasis","Histograms","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","asynchronous circuits","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high resolution flash time-to-digital converter","high performance synchronous circuit design","asynchronous circuit design","on-chip time measurement circuitry","on-chip implementation","FPGA implementation","Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous systems","GALS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A High Resolution Flash Time-to-Digital Converter Taking Into Account Process Variability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4137042/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"10284146","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","conferenceDate":"12-14 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Resolution Flash Time-to-Digital Converter Taking Into Account Process Variability","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"27710163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062012S","chronDate":"12-14 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4137015","isNumber":"4137016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4137015","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4137016","articleId":"4137042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4137043,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Mullins","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Mullins","id":"37282357100"},{"name":"Simon Moore","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Moore","id":"37276662100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2771-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-8681"}],"articleNumber":"4137043","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Integrated circuit interconnections","Power system interconnection","Network-on-a-chip","Timing","Synchronization","Robustness","Thermal management","Power system management","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","digital integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","synchronisation","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI systems","pausible clocking schemes","independently clocked synchronous IP blocks","synchronous design style","asynchronous interfaces","efficient block level implementation","synchronisation failure rates","data-driven operation","on-chip buses design","on-chip networks","local clock implementations","clock-tree insertion delays","multiclock synchronous systems","on-chip interconnects"]}],"abstract":"VLSI systems are often constructed from a multitude of independently clocked synchronous IP blocks. Unfortunately, while a synchronous design style may produce efficient block level implementations it does little to support their composition. The addition of asynchronous interfaces to each synchronous block is one way to simplify and strengthen their integration. Asynchronous interfaces allow blocks to be composed without the need to consider synchronisation failure rates, permit data-driven operation and provide greater freedom when designing on-chip buses and networks. This paper surveys the significant body of published work in this area. We highlight similarities between schemes that are often concealed by differences in specification or circuit style. We also present new local clock implementations and provide solutions to mitigate the effect of clock-tree insertion delays. The ultimate goal of this work is to permit multi-clock synchronous systems to be composed simply, robustly and efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/ASYNC.2007.15","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4137015/4137016/04137043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2007.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137016","startPage":"175","endPage":"185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demystifying Data-Driven and Pausible Clocking Schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Demystifying Data-Driven and Pausible Clocking Schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137043/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"10284147","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4137043/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demystifying Data-Driven and Pausible Clocking Schemes","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"27710175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078249S","chronDate":"12-14 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4137015","isNumber":"4137016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4137015","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4137016","articleId":"4137043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4137067,"authors":[{"name":"Constantin Paleologu","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Paleologu","id":"37304184600"},{"name":"Calin Vladeanu","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Calin","lastName":"Vladeanu","id":"38229023100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2798-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4137067","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Adaptive algorithm","Multiaccess communication","Convergence","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Matched filters","Least squares methods","Resonance light scattering","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","code division multiple access","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE receivers","DS-CDMA systems","least mean square adaptive algorithm","minimum mean-squared error","single user adaptive receiver","asynchronous direct sequence-code division multiple access system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive algorithm","Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) receiver","Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system"]}],"abstract":"This paper analyzes the behavior of the Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive algorithm in the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) single user adaptive receiver for the asynchronous direct sequence-code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system.

The aim of this new concept is the power consumption reduction. As well known, the modern modulation systems, with a high number of constellation points, exhibit a high peak-power to average-power ratio, typically of several dB. It follows that owing to the random constellation points sequence, the output power is \"low\" for a long time and only for a short time the output power reaches the peak value: this fact is useful in saving power supply. In practice the DC power is delivered to the amplifier depending on the input power level. In this way a DC power saving (up to 45%) is obtained. Moreover no degradation of the transmitted spectrum has been observed in comparison with the standard operating condition.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1995.336912","publicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4137114/4137115/04137124.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"35","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1995.336912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave power amplifier with \"envelope controlled\" drain power supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","displayDocTitle":"Microwave power amplifier with \"envelope controlled\" drain power supply","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137124/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave power amplifier with \"envelope controlled\" drain power supply","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"EUMA-1-9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031827S","chronDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","isNumber":"4137115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4137114","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4137124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4137163,"authors":[{"name":"Yohtaro Umeda","affiliation":["NTT LSI Laboratories, 3-1 Morinosato Wakamiya, Atsugi-shi, 243-01 Japan, Tel: +81 462 40 2792, Fax: +81 462 40 2872"],"firstName":"Yohtaro","lastName":"Umeda","id":"37284060600"},{"name":"Kazuo Osafune","affiliation":["NTT LSI Laboratories, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Osafune","id":"37298758700"},{"name":"Takatomo Enoki","affiliation":["NTT LSI Laboratories, 3-1 Morinosato Wakamiya, Atsugi-shi, 243-01 Japan, Tel: +81 462 40 2792, Fax: +81 462 40 2872"],"firstName":"Takatomo","lastName":"Enoki","id":"37268748400"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ito","affiliation":["NTT LSI Laboratories, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ito","id":"37279183600"},{"name":"Yasunobu Ishil","affiliation":["NTT LSI Laboratories, 3-1 Morinosato Wakamiya, Atsugi-shi, 243-01 Japan, Tel: +81 462 40 2792, Fax: +81 462 40 2872"],"firstName":"Yasunobu","lastName":"Ishil","id":"37088126518"}],"articleNumber":"4137163","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":29},"abstract":"38.6-GHz operation of an SCFL static binary frequency dvider is achieved using 0.1-\u03bcm-gate InAIAs/InGaAs/InP HEMTs with an InP-recess-etch stopper. This is the highest operation frequency for static frequency dividers using FETs, as far as we know. In addition, propagation delay time of an SCFL inverter estimated from a ring oscillator is 6.6 ps/gate. The tranmission delay due to interconnection lines is investigated by taking account of travelling wave effects. Delay time analysis for above circuits proves that the transmission delay is much larger than the parasitic charging delay and as much as the intrinsic gate delay in such high speed. A comparative study shows the validity of the transmission delay and LC-line approximation, and reveals the importance of shortening signal path length and matching impedance between driver circuits and interconnection lines in ultra-high-speed operation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Indium gallium arsenide","Indium phosphide","HEMTs","MODFETs","Delay effects","Propagation delay","Integrated circuit interconnections","FETs","Inverters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1995.336950","publicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4137114/4137115/04137163.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1995.336950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SCFL static frequency divider using InAIAs/InGaAs/InP HEMTs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SCFL static frequency divider using InAIAs/InGaAs/InP HEMTs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137163/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","conferenceDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SCFL static frequency divider using InAIAs/InGaAs/InP HEMTs","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"EUMA-1-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075926S","chronDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","isNumber":"4137115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4137114","citationCount":"14","articleId":"4137163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4137165,"authors":[{"name":"M Werthen","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Mobil-und Satellitenfunktechnik, Kamp-Lintfort, Germany"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Werthen","id":"37298707900"},{"name":"M Rittweger","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Mobil-und Satellitenfunktechnik, Kamp-Lintfort, Germany"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Rittweger","id":"37299932600"},{"name":"I Wolff","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Mobil-und Satellitenfunktechnik, Kamp-Lintfort, Germany"],"firstName":"I","lastName":"Wolff","id":"37274971400"}],"articleNumber":"4137165","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"abstract":"By combing the FDTD and the FD2 method, a nearly ideal absorbing boundary together with a mode extraction algorithm for arbitrariy shaped homogeneously filled waveguides is realized.

An elegant example of such a specific implementation is presented here in the form of a prototype. It is a processor which essentially performs complex vector rotatioins in 2-dimensional planes. This operation is realized in CORDIC arithmetic and three pipeline CORDIC cores sustain a throughput rate as high as the pipeline clock rate. The prototype presented here is a board level implementation built around four pipeline (CORDIC chips. A single chip version could be easily designed. In radar applications, update rates in the MHz range for then-antenna arrays can be obtained with only one such single chip processor.","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1995.337010","publicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4137114/4137115/04137223.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1995.337010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of the recursive QR algorithrm on a 2 \u00d7 2 CORDIC testboard: a case study for radar applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of the recursive QR algorithrm on a 2 \u00d7 2 CORDIC testboard: a case study for radar applications","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137223/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","conferenceDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of the recursive QR algorithrm on a 2 \u00d7 2 CORDIC testboard: a case study for radar applications","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"EUMA-1-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04056S","chronDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","isNumber":"4137115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4137114","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4137223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4137257,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Shueh Lee","affiliation":["Microwave and Terahertz Technology Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, The University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT UK"],"firstName":"Hai-Shueh","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292583400"},{"name":"Roger D Pollard","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Department of Electronic, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Roger D","lastName":"Pollard","id":"37266833700"},{"name":"Christopher Snowden","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Department of Electronic, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Snowden","id":"37283171400"}],"articleNumber":"4137257","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137257","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Frequency","Bandwidth","Power amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Microwave amplifiers","Prototypes","Gain","Base stations","System performance"]}],"abstract":"The design of high linearity, wide-band feedforward amplifiers is addressed with particular emphasis on high quality linear-phase components.

In this scheme, the source plane (where only one field component is needed) is loated several nodes inside the terminal plane and the field component in the incident plane is simply corrected. Under this arrangement, the interaction between the source excitation and the reflected wave at the terminal plane can be separated in time domain. This allows us to apply absorbing boundary conditions on the terminal plane directly, without any special treatment. Moreover, the terminal plane can be located very close to, even at three nodes in front of, the discontinuity.

Due to the small geometry and the 0.2 \u03bcm GaAs/GaAIAs HEMT technology, a bandwidth from 15 to 60 GHz could be achieved. Coplanar waveguides and lumped elements were used as passive circuit elements. The main topology consists of a differential amplifier and a coplanar balun. The control voltages of the differential amplifier are applied in a push-pull scheme. The balun operates as 180\u00b0-power combiner and subtracts both RF-signals. In this way, the common mode is rejected and the phase of the output signal changes by 180\u00b0, when the amplitude crosses zero.","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1995.337096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1995.337096","startPage":"921","endPage":"925","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4137114/4137241/04137310.pdf","publicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An extremely wide band balanced amplitude controller in coplanar waveguide technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","displayDocTitle":"An extremely wide band balanced amplitude controller in coplanar waveguide technology","conferenceDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137310/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An extremely wide band balanced amplitude controller in coplanar waveguide technology","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"EUMA-2-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026196S","chronDate":"4-4 Sept. 1995","isNumber":"4137241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4137114","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4137310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4137335,"authors":[{"name":"H Kobeissi","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"H","lastName":"Kobeissi","id":"37296199900"},{"name":"K Wu","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278659100"},{"name":"D Drolet","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"D","lastName":"Drolet","id":"37296196700"},{"name":"M G Stubbs","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"M G","lastName":"Stubbs","id":"37274308400"},{"name":"G Larralde","affiliation":["SPAR AeroSpace Products Limited, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada"],"firstName":"G","lastName":"Larralde","id":"37296197800"},{"name":"S Rao","affiliation":["SPAR AeroSpace Products Limited, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Rao","id":"37291303400"}],"articleNumber":"4137335","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137335","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High temperature superconductors","Array signal processing","Satellite communication","Couplers","Frequency","Bandwidth","Couplings","Power dividers","Dielectric losses","Conducting materials"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1995.337121","publicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 25th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4137114/4137241/04137335.pdf","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1995.337121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and performance of an HTS beamforming network for satellite communications","abstract":"A high temperature superconductor (HTS) beamforming network (BFN) is reported based on a multiple power divider technique involving a cascade of 3 dB branch-line couplers.

Superconducting beamforming networks can offer several advantages compared to a conventional BFN, including a significant reduction in size and weight, as well as lower loss and higher sensitivity. Experimental results for the BFN show insertion losses ranging from 6.1 dB to 6.4 dB for the four output ports at the centre frequency. Return losses are better than 13 dB at the input and output ports over the 500 MHz bandwidth.

Development of the integrated HNS services requires implementation of the appliance components (with APIs) and the services, according to each home-network environment. There are various implementation standards such as DLNA, ECHONET, OSGi and Jinifor the HNS applications. Therefore, even if a developer can choose the optimal one, it's very difficult to develop the integrated services by composing a new HNS implementation. In this paper, we propose a model-driven development of integrated HNS service applications. In our former manuscript, platform-independent design language for verifying HNS service scenarios was proposed. Our model-driven development method uses this design language as a meta-model of integrated HNS services. By model transformation to concrete implementation together with verification by SMV (symbolic model checking), productivity and quality of this kind of HNS applications are improved.","doi":"10.1109/APSEC.2006.17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2006.17","startPage":"45","endPage":"52","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 13th Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4137386/4137387/04137401.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 13th Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC'06)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adopting Model-Driven Development for Integrated Services and Appliances in Home Network Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adopting Model-Driven Development for Integrated Services and Appliances in Home Network Systems","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4137401/","accessionNumber":"10266209","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137401/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adopting Model-Driven Development for Integrated Services and Appliances in Home Network Systems","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"26850045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081254S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4137386","isNumber":"4137387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4137386","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4137387","articleId":"4137401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4137528,"authors":[{"name":"Sanming Hu","affiliation":["Positioning and Wireless Technology Centre, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sanming","lastName":"Hu","id":"37290176300"},{"name":"Honghui Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Honghui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293462100"},{"name":"Choi Look Law","affiliation":["Positioning and Wireless Technology Centre, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Choi Look","lastName":"Law","id":"37279807600"},{"name":"Zhongxiang Shen","affiliation":["Positioning and Wireless Technology Centre, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhongxiang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37273304700"},{"name":"Lei Zhu","affiliation":["Positioning and Wireless Technology Centre, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37290348600"},{"name":"Wenxun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenxun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291410100"},{"name":"Wenbin Dou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Dou","id":"37302164500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4137528","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1475},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backscatter","Ultra wideband technology","Ultra wideband antennas","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Loaded antennas","Radar antennas","Antenna theory","Perfectly matched layers","Boundary conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","electromagnetic wave absorption","finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip antennas","monopole antennas","radar cross-sections","slot antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscattering cross section","ultrawideband antennas","UWB antennas","finite-difference time-domain method","FDTD","perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary condition","monostatic radar cross section","RCS","square-slot antenna","printed circular-disc monopole antenna","PCDMA","scattering characteristics","3 to 11 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","radar cross section (RCS)","time domain","ultrawideband (UWB) antenna"]}],"abstract":"Backscattering of ultrawideband (UWB) antennas is theoretically and experimentally studied in this letter.

Three variants of the DWBA are presented, and their performance is compared. While the first variant incurs larger idle times (and, hence, poor performance), the other two algorithms achieve better but different performance with critical dissimilarities. Our analysis also focuses on the fair assignment of excessive bandwidth in the upstream direction to highly loaded optical network units. We compare the performance of DWBA to another algorithm that relies on static-channel allocation.

The filter is implemented using silicon on oxide channel waveguides and consists of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with two ring resonator all-pass filters (APFs) on each arm. The filter architecture is based on the sum and difference of the APFs responses. The ring resonators introduce a nonlinear phase response in each arm that allows carving narrow frequency bands out of a broad spectrum. In this paper, we demonstrate a 3-dB filter bandwidth of 1.0 GHz with a stopband rejection of better than 25 dB. The filter free spectral range is 16.5 GHz. Thermooptic phase shifters are used to tune the filter. As silicon has a large thermooptic coefficient compared to silica, the demonstrated filter requires a low tuning power of less than 300 mW. In addition, this filter is compact with dimensions 25 times smaller than the same filter would be if it were made using standard silica on silicon waveguides with a 0.8% step index contrast","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4137567/04137615.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2006.888932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2006.888932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of a Fourth-Order Pole-Zero Optical Filter Integrated Using CMOS Processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","CMOS process","Resonator filters","Optical waveguides","Optical ring resonators","Silicon compounds","Narrowband","Foundries","Frequency","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","CMOS integrated circuits","elemental semiconductors","integrated optics","integrated optoelectronics","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","optical filters","optical phase shifters","optical resonators","optical waveguides","silicon","spectral line broadening","thermo-optical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fourth-order optical filter","pole-zero optical filter","integrated optics","CMOS processes","silicon complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor foundry","silicon-on-oxide channel waveguides","Mach-Zehnder interferometer","ring resonator filters","all-pass filters","ring resonators","nonlinear phase response","stopband rejection","thermooptic phase shifters","filter tuning","thermooptic coefficient","1.0 GHz","16.5 GHz","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-pass filters (APFs)","bandpass filters","integrated optics","optical waveguide components"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of a Fourth-Order Pole-Zero Optical Filter Integrated Using CMOS Processes","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4137615/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9379473","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of a Fourth-Order Pole-Zero Optical Filter Integrated Using CMOS Processes","sourcePdf":"25jlt01-rasras.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156802S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","isNumber":"4137567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"64","articleId":"4137615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4137620,"authors":[{"name":"Frederik Van Laere","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University-Inter University Microelectronics Center, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4137567/4137620/4137620-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frederik Van Laere (S'05) received the degree in electrical engineering from Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, in 2004, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the Department of Information Technology.","He is currently working on the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanophotonic waveguide components and their integration with active functionality.

Fueled by this promise, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel scheme that facilitates the use of reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers (RSOAs) as colorless upstream transmitters. Central to the scheme is the use of a passive reflective path that is placed at the remote node (RN) to reflect a spectral slice of the broadband amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) light emitted from each RSOA. The reflected spectral slice, termed as a seeding light, establishes a self-seeding of the RSOA with measurements indicating the self-seeded output to be incoherent with a low relative intensity noise. The subsequent direct modulation of the self-seeding RSOA with nonreturn-to-zero data at 1.25 Gb/s for upstream transmission exhibits good transmission and crosstalk performance after traversing 21 km of single-mode fiber. Our proposed scheme eliminates the need for centralized broadband sources, external modulators, and active temperature control within the RN and between the RN and the optical network unit. Aside from the feasibility study of self-seeding RSOAs, we investigate the upstream performance dependence on the characteristics of the seeding light. Our investigations reveal that there exists a noise floor limit of the bit error rate (BER) of the self-seeded upstream signal. The noise floor is shown to vary with an initial optical seeding power that affects the level of ASE noise suppression of the self-seeded upstream signal. None the less, the RSOA self-seeds at a user-defined wavelength with a sufficient suppression of ASE noise to achieve a BER=10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n with only -30.5 dBm of initial optical seeding power. Our characterization of the frequency response of the RSOA reveals a high-pass filter response that suppresses the modulation on the reflected seeding light, and thus stabilizing the self-seeded output. Collectively, these features highlight the potential of using the self-seeding RSOAs to realize a cost-efficient WDM-PON solution in the near future","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4137567/04137622.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"74","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2006.888936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2006.888936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directly Modulated Self-Seeding Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers as Colorless Transmitters in Wavelength Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical transmitters","Wavelength division multiplexing","Passive optical networks","Crosstalk","Optical noise","Semiconductor device noise","Optical network units","Optical filters","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","high-pass filters","optical fibre networks","optical modulation","optical noise","optical transmitters","reflectivity","semiconductor optical amplifiers","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct modulation","self-seeding semiconductor optical amplifiers","reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers","colorless transmitters","wavelength division multiplexing","passive optical networks","wavelength-specific transmitters","upstream transmitters","passive reflective path","remote node","broadband amplified spontaneous emission","reflected spectral slice","incoherent self-seeded output","relative intensity noise","upstream transmission","crosstalk performance","single-mode fiber","optical network unit","noise floor","bit error rate","optical seeding","high-pass filter response","modulation suppression","1.25 Gbit/s","21 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access networks","colorless transmitters","fiber to the home","passive optical networks","reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers (RSOAs)","wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Directly Modulated Self-Seeding Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers as Colorless Transmitters in Wavelength Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Networks","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4137622/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9379471","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directly Modulated Self-Seeding Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers as Colorless Transmitters in Wavelength Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"25jlt01-wong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061516S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4137567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4137567","articleId":"4137622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4137630,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The technique uses decision trees and artificial neural networks for winding material classification, along with finite-element/boundary element modeling of the transformer for the calculation of the performance characteristics of each considered design. The efficiency and accuracy provided by the hybrid numerical model render it particularly suitable for use with optimization algorithms. The accuracy of this method is 96% (classification success rate for the winding material on an unknown test set), which makes it very efficient for industrial use","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2006.892258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4137654/04137659.pdf","startPage":"1633","endPage":"1636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.892258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Intelligence Combined with Hybrid FEM-BE Techniques for Global Transformer Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137659/","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Intelligence Combined with Hybrid FEM-BE Techniques for Global Transformer Optimization","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9412632","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4137659/","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Intelligence Combined with Hybrid FEM-BE Techniques for Global Transformer Optimization","sourcePdf":"43tmag04-amoiralis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100141S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4137654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4137654","articleId":"4137659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4137667,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Ausserhofer","affiliation":["Institute for Fundamentals and Theory in Electrical Engineering IGTE, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Ausserhofer","id":"37297265000"},{"name":"Oszkr Biro","affiliation":["Institute for Fundamentals and Theory in Electrical Engineering IGTE, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Oszkr","lastName":"Biro","id":"37281881900"},{"name":"Kurt Preis","affiliation":["Institute for Fundamentals and Theory in Electrical Engineering IGTE, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Preis","id":"37281882800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4137667","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear equations","Steady-state","Magnetic materials","Magnetic separation","Magnetic flux","Eddy currents","Electromagnetic transients","Nonlinear magnetics","Electromagnetic forces","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy currents","fixed point arithmetic","Fourier series","harmonic analysis","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic balance method","nonlinear eddy-current problems","steady-state methods","Fourier series","nonlinear behavior","fixed-point iteration","harmonic components","transient process","time-stepping methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eddy currents","nonlinear equations","nonlinear magnetics","periodic functions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137667","abstract":"A method is presented which determines the steady-state solution of nonlinear eddy current problems.

Even in case of large applied fields, when the magnetic device is small, the deviation from uniform distribution is significant.

The goal of the analysis is to avoid the unstable and unreliable behavior of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution. The model considered here is based on the subcell thin wire modeling of inner conductor of a coaxial probe. Two main categories of structures and excitation models are considered. In the first category, the truncated thin wire is separated from the absorbing boundary by two FDTD cells, for several excitation models and their location along the wire. In the second category, the thin wire is extended into the absorbing boundary, and both the hard and the resistive source models are investigated. The comparison of the results for the two aforementioned categories of the FDTD coaxial probe feeds may be of particular interest to computational electromagnetics community, as it may yield insight into the limitations of the most commercial software packages which do not allow for extension of the coaxial probe model into the absorbing boundary","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4137654/04137729.pdf","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2006.891009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.891009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD Subcell Modeling of the Inner Conductor of the Coaxial Feed: Accuracy and Convergence Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Conductors","Coaxial components","Feeds","Convergence","Probes","Wire","Electromagnetic analysis","Electromagnetic coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","computational electromagnetics","conductors (electric)","convergence","electromagnetic coupling","finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip antennas","probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD subcell modeling","inner conductors","coaxial probe model","convergence analysis","accuracy analysis","electromagnetic coupled patch antenna","finite-difference time-domain solution","boundary absorption","computational electromagnetics community","commercial software package"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coaxial feed","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","microstrip antennas","subcell modeling","thin wire"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Subcell Modeling of the Inner Conductor of the Coaxial Feed: Accuracy and Convergence Analysis","volume":"43","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4137729/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9412564","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Subcell Modeling of the Inner Conductor of the Coaxial Feed: Accuracy and Convergence Analysis","sourcePdf":"43tmag04-hajiaboli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051766S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4137654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4137654","articleId":"4137729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4137730,"authors":[{"name":"Toshihiro Hanawa","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Hanawa","id":"37295800500"},{"name":"Soichiro Ikuno","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Soichiro","lastName":"Ikuno","id":"37269787200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4137730","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Optical propagation","Photonic crystals","Finite difference methods","Parallel processing","Optical waveguides","Time domain analysis","Optical refraction","Optical variables control","Magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","light propagation","optical computing","optical waveguides","parallel processing","photonic crystals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale simulation","optical propagation","3D photonic crystal optical waveguides","FDTD method","parallel processing","finite-difference time-domain method","micron-order wavelength"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic analysis","finite-diffence time-domain (FDTD) methods","numerical analysis","parallel processing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, optical propagation in a 3-D photonic crystal optical waveguide is simulated numerically using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.

The proposed method exploits the fact that levels of high resolution usually extend over small subdomains only.

Our efforts are dedicated to the aspects of fault modeling and fault extraction. The FE-based phase variable model is developed to describe the PM machine with internal short circuit faults. This model is built with the parameters [inductances and back Electromotive Force (EMF)] obtained from FE computations of the machine with the same type of fault. The developed model has two features. It includes the detailed information of the fault including the location of the shorted turns and the number of turns involved. It keeps the accuracy of the FE model by taking only a fraction of time needed by FE operation. This is particularly desired for diagnosing faults in machines connected to a control circuit. The wavelet transform is used to perform machine current/voltage signature analysis. Excellent results were obtained providing information that would not be otherwise available except by measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.892301","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2006.892301","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1732","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4137654/04137782.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137782/","displayDocTitle":"Internal Short Circuit Fault Diagnosis for PM Machines Using FE-Based Phase Variable Model and Wavelets Analysis","volume":"43","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"9412656","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4137782/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internal Short Circuit Fault Diagnosis for PM Machines Using FE-Based Phase Variable Model and Wavelets Analysis","sourcePdf":"43tmag04-mohammed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059272S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4137654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4137654","articleId":"4137782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4137785,"authors":[{"name":"Tadao Ohtani","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Limited, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadao","lastName":"Ohtani","id":"37289853000"},{"name":"Kenji Taguchi","affiliation":["Kumamoto National College of Technology, Koshi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Taguchi","id":"37288686800"},{"name":"Tatsuya Kashiwa","affiliation":["Kitami Institute of Technology, Kitami, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Kashiwa","id":"37298978700"},{"name":"Yasushi Kanai","affiliation":["Niigata Institute of Technology, Kashiwazaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Kanai","id":"37297048100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4137785","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Reflection","Space technology","Algorithm design and analysis","Dielectrics","Corrugated surfaces","Aerospace industry","Educational institutions","Numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overlap algorithm","nonstandard FDTD method","finite-difference time-domain method","nonuniform mesh","dielectric flat panel","surface corrugation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method","nonstandard finite-difference time-domain (NS-FDTD) method","nonuniform mesh","numerical analysis","scattering"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the overlap algorithm is applied to the nonstandard finite-difference time-domain (NS-FDTD) method using a nonuniform mesh in a 2-D space.

The time-domain method is based on the different nature of the problem in conductors and semiconductors, compared to the insulating media that separate them. Therefore, the static problem in the silicon oxide is separated from the diffusion problem in conductors.

The frequency is stepped linearly with a constant frequency change, and range cells are formed by fast Fourier transform processing. The covered bandwidth defines the range resolution, and the length of the frequency step restricts the nonambiguous range interval. A random choice of the transmitted frequencies suppresses the range ambiguity, improves covert detection, and reduces the signal interference between adjacent sensors. As a result of the random modulation, however, a noise component is added to the range/Doppler sidelobes. In this paper, relationships of random step frequency radar are compared with frequency-modulated continuous wave noise radar and the statistical characteristics of the ambiguity function and the sidelobe noise floor are analyzed. Algorithms are investigated, which reduce the sidelobes and the noise-floor contribution from strong dominating reflectors in the scene.

Moreover, the classification problem is normally understood as the classification of a single image while the capabilities of a single network of performing automatic classification and feature extraction over a collection of archived images has not been explored so far. In this paper, besides assessing the performance of MLP for the classification of very high resolution images, we investigate on the generalization capabilities of this type of algorithms with the purpose of using them as a tool for fully automatic classification of collections of satellite images, either at very high or at high-resolution.

User-defined classes in large image databases are often composed of several groups of images and span very different scales in the space of low-level visual descriptors. The interactive retrieval of such image classes is then very difficult. To address this challenge, we evaluate here, in the context of satellite image retrieval, two general improvements for relevance feedback using support vector machines (SVMs). First, to optimize the transfer of information between the user and the system, we focus on the criterion employed by the system for selecting the images presented to the user at every feedback round. We put forward an active-learning selection criterion that minimizes redundancy between the candidate images shown to the user. Second, for image classes spanning very different scales in the low-level description space, we find that a high sensitivity of the SVM to the scale of the data brings about a low retrieval performance. We argue that the insensitivity to scale is desirable in this context, and we show how to obtain it by the use of specific kernel functions.

Content-based querying allows an efficient retrieval of images based on the information they contain, rather than their acquisition date or geographical extent. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) have been successfully applied in the PicSOM system to content-based image retrieval in databases of conventional images. In this paper, we investigate and extend the potential of PicSOM for the analysis of remote sensing data. We propose methods for detecting man-made structures, as well as supervised and unsupervised change detection, based on the same framework. In this paper, a database was artificially created by splitting each satellite image to be analyzed into small images. After training the PicSOM on this imagelet database, both interactive and off-line queries were made to detect man-made structures, as well as changes between two very high resolution images from different years. Experimental results were both evaluated quantitatively and discussed qualitatively, and suggest that this new approach is suitable for analyzing very high resolution optical satellite imagery.

In this paper, we present our recently developed content-based multimodal Geospatial Information Retrieval and Indexing System (GeoIRIS) which includes automatic feature extraction, visual content mining from large-scale image databases, and high-dimensional database indexing for fast retrieval. Using these underpinnings, we have developed techniques for complex queries that merge information from heterogeneous geospatial databases, retrievals of objects based on shape and visual characteristics, analysis of multiobject relationships for the retrieval of objects in specific spatial configurations, and semantic models to link low-level image features with high-level visual descriptors. GeoIRIS brings this diverse set of technologies together into a coherent system with an aim of allowing image analysts to more rapidly identify relevant imagery. GeoIRIS is able to answer analysts' questions in seconds, such as \"given a query image, show me database satellite images that have similar objects and spatial relationship that are within a certain radius of a landmark.\"","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.890579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4137841/04137867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.890579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137841","startPage":"839","endPage":"852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GeoIRIS: Geospatial Information Retrieval and Indexing System\u2014Content Mining, Semantics Modeling, and Complex Queries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GeoIRIS: Geospatial Information Retrieval and Indexing System\u2014Content Mining, Semantics Modeling, and Complex Queries","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9382263","pubMedId":"18270555","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4137867/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GeoIRIS: Geospatial Information Retrieval and Indexing System\u2014Content Mining, Semantics Modeling, and Complex Queries","sourcePdf":"45tgrs04-shyu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099091S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4137841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"4137841","articleId":"4137867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4137873,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We show that as long as a certain condition is satisfied, the achievable rate region is the capacity region for one type of degraded discrete memoryless ZC.

In contrast, in this correspondence joint codes are designed that are optimized for communication over the unknown channel and operate over the full coherence time.

MSDD, which jointly processes blocks of N received symbols to detect N-1 data symbols, allows for power-efficient transmission without requiring channel state information at the receiver. In previous work, the authors showed that computational efficient sphere decoding algorithms can be used to accomplish MSDD. In this correspondence, the computational complexity of this sphere-decoding based MSDD is analyzed. In particular, it is proven by means of a lower bound that the complexity of the Fincke-Pohst multiple-symbol differential sphere decoder (FP-MSDSD), while being very low over wide ranges of N and signal-to-noise ratios, is exponential in N in principle. Furthermore, both exact and simple approximate expressions for the complexity of FP-MSDSD are derived, which allow for quick assessment of ranges of useful window sizes N of FP-MSDSD and show that the exponential rate of growth of the complexity of FP-MSDSD is asymptotically equal to that of brute-force MSDD","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4137872/04137895.pdf","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.892775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.892775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Complexity of Sphere Decoding for Differential Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Rayleigh channels","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Phase detection","Fading","Channel state information","Computational efficiency","Computational complexity","Differential phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","differential detection","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere decoding","multiple-symbol differential detection","MSDD","multiple-input-multiple-output channel","MIMO Rayleigh-fading channel","power-efficient transmission","computational complexity","Fincke-Pohst decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complexity analysis","differential space\u2013time modulation (DSTM)","multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD)","Rayleigh-fading channels","sphere decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Complexity of Sphere Decoding for Differential Detection","volume":"53","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4137895/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9381951","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Complexity of Sphere Decoding for Differential Detection","sourcePdf":"53tit04-pauli-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102147S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4137872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4137872","articleId":"4137895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4137897,"authors":[{"name":"Nazanin Rahnavard","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Nazanin","lastName":"Rahnavard","id":"37283985300"},{"name":"Badri N.

For general signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), starting from a given base unitary constellation of finite cardinality, and using the cutoff rate expression as the design criterion, input probabilities and per-antenna amplitudes for the constellation points are obtained via a difference of convex programming formulation. Using the mutual information as a performance metric, it is shown that the optimized constellations significantly outperform the base unitary designs from which they are obtained in the low-medium SNR regime, and indeed they also similarly outperform the mutual information achieved by isotropically distributed unitary inputs for the continuous input channel [i.e., the so-called unitary space-time capacity (USTC)]. At sufficiently high SNRs, the resulting mutual information coincides with that of the base unitary designs. Thus the optimum constellation design technique works over the entire range of SNRs.

The results we presented in this work in the low-SNR regime can also be applied to the infinite bandwidth regime","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.892788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.892788","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1309","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4137872/04137904.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Channels in the Low-SNR Regime: Communication Rate, Error Exponent, and Signal Peakiness","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Channels in the Low-SNR Regime: Communication Rate, Error Exponent, and Signal Peakiness","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","volume":"53","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4137904/","accessionNumber":"9381927","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4137904/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Channels in the Low-SNR Regime: Communication Rate, Error Exponent, and Signal Peakiness","sourcePdf":"53tit04-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090546S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4137872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4137872","articleId":"4137904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4137906,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292354200"},{"name":"Wei Mo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Mo","id":"37089148597"},{"name":"Yao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37274225200"},{"name":"Zhengdao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengdao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279253400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4137906","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Information rates","Steganography","Conferences","Cryptography","Lattices","Computational complexity","Data mining","Gray-scale","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiplexing","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general fading channel","diversity gain","multiplexing gain","multiple-input multiple-output channel","MIMO","independent-identically distribution","iid Rayleigh-fading assumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["General fading channel","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multiplexing","diversity","optimal tradeoff","space\u2013time codes","spatial correlation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4137906","abstract":"The optimal tradeoff between diversity gain and multiplexing gain for multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) channels has been studied recently under the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)

The control system is transformed into a Lureacute system, and Lyapunov's direct method is used to guarantee the stability of the control system. Experimental studies suggest that the control system is insensitive to parametric uncertainty, load, and disturbances. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared against a conventional proportional derivative (PD) controller.

Parameter values are drawn from a broad base of recently published wideband and multiple-antenna measurements. A methodology is given to generate fast-fading coefficients between a base station and a mobile user based on the summation of directional plane waves derived from the statistics of the space-time parameters. Extensions to the baseline channel model, such as polarized antennas, are given to provide a greater variety of spatial environments.

By considering the systems using the random binary spreading code (RBSC) and deterministic binary spreading code (DBSC), the effects of the multipath interference and multiuser interference are included in the analyses of the bit-error rate and bit-error outage. Also, for the performance analysis of the system employing the decision-feedback (DF) detector, the effect of error propagation is taken into account. It is known that enlarging the spreading factor can enhance the interference-rejection ability of a DS-CDMA system and, hence, can improve the performance. However, it also lengthens the symbol duration and, thus, stiffens the diversity penalty resulting from the channel variation within an ST-code-word duration. Thus, a moderate spreading factor should be chosen. In this paper, for the RBSC system using the simple-maximum-likelihood (SML) detector, we derive an optimum spreading factor that is optimum in the minimum-error-probability sense. Numerical results have revealed that the derived optimum spreading factor is a good estimate of the ones for the DBSC systems using the SML, zero-forcing, and DF detectors. Therefore, it is very useful for system designers in determining the system parameters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Two-Branch Space-Time Block-Coded DS-CDMA Systems in Time-Varying Multipath Rayleigh Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.891424","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4137999/04138011.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.891424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Two-Branch Space-Time Block-Coded DS-CDMA Systems in Time-Varying Multipath Rayleigh Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4138011/","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9382179","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Two-Branch Space-Time Block-Coded DS-CDMA Systems in Time-Varying Multipath Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt02-chiang-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066261S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4137999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4137999","articleId":"4138011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":4138018,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Department of Electronics,Communications Research Group, University of York, York, UK","Center for Studies in Telecommunications, Pontificia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4137999/4138018/4138018-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rodrigo C. de Lamare (M'05) received the Diploma degree in electronic engineering from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1998 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Pontificia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","From January 2004 to June 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Center for Studies in Telecommunications (CETUC), PUC-Rio, and from July 2005 to January 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with UFRJ.

Most of the algorithms so far consider either the problem of minimizing the sum of transmitted power under quality of service (QoS) constraints given in terms of minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a static channel or the problem of mitigating fast fading in a single dynamic link. In this paper, we suggest a new approach to the power control by treating the QoS requirement as another objective for the power control and a fully distributed method for solving the multiobjective power optimization problem. The obtained solution is parameterized so that a tradeoff can be made between power consumption and QoS. In the limit case, when only QoS is weighted, the algorithm reduces to the well-known distributed power control algorithm (IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. 42, no. 2/3/4, pt. 1, Feb./Mar./Apr. 1994). In the other limit, the algorithm reduces to transmission with fixed minimum power. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are studied both theoretically and with numerical simulations. Although we only consider SINR and power sum, our algorithm could be easily modified to take other objectives, such as throughput, into account","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4137999/04138021.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2006.889565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2006.889565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Distributed Power Control Algorithm for CDMA Wireless Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Multiaccess communication","Wireless communication","Quality of service","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Optimization methods","Energy consumption","Convergence of numerical methods","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","distributed control","fading channels","power control","quality of service","radio links","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective distributed power control algorithm","CDMA","wireless communication systems","quality of service","QoS","minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","static channel","fast fading channel","single dynamic link","multiobjective power optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","multi-objective optimization","power control","radio resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Distributed Power Control Algorithm for CDMA Wireless Communication Systems","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4138021/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9382161","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Distributed Power Control Algorithm for CDMA Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"56tvt02-elmusrati.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155794S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4137999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4137999","articleId":"4138021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4138022,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Forenza","affiliation":["LLC, Rearden, San Francisco, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4137999/4138022/4138022-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Forenza (S'04-M'06) received the M.S. degree in telecommunications engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, and Eurecom Institute, Sophia Antipolis, France, in 2001 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2006.","In 2001, he interned as a Systems Engineer at Iospan Wireless, Inc., San Jose, CA, which is a startup company that developed the first commercial MIMO-OFDM communication system.

The approach is based on switching between low-complexity transmission schemes, including statistical beamforming, double space-time transmit diversity, and spatial multiplexing, depending on the changing channel statistics, as a practical means of approaching the spatially correlated MIMO channel capacity. We first derive new ergodic capacity expressions for each MIMO transmission scheme in spatially correlated channels. Based on these results, we demonstrate that adaptive switching between MIMO schemes yields significant capacity gains over fixed transmission schemes. We also derive accurate analytical approximations for the optimal signal-to-noise-ratio switching thresholds, which correspond to the crossing-points of the capacity curves. These thresholds are shown to vary, depending on the spatial correlation, and are used to identify key switching parameters.

However, a clipping is a nonlinear process that may lead to significant distortion and performance loss. An iterative time-domain decision-aided clipping compensation framework is proposed to mitigate the distortion caused by the intentional clipping with the additional constraint of out-of-band noise filtering, and it is compared with the existing frequency-domain scheme. It incorporates the simple additive distortion model and the minimum mean-square distortion (MMSD) model, with the options of hard and soft symbol estimation. Extensive simulation results are provided for the performance comparison among different schemes. The MMSD-distortion-model-based frequency-domain clipping compensation gives the best performance and is applied to scalable video transmission with a multiband OFDM.

We model the time-varying wireless channel as a stochastic process and formulate a stochastic optimization problem, which aims at maximizing system efficiency by controlling the power allocation of each link and the data rate of each user in the system.

Furthermore, when the receiver employs a low-complexity decoder such as a zero-forcing decoder, the proposed scheme shows improved performance compared with the existing space-frequency coded OFDM schemes","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.891414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4137999/04138029.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.891414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137999","startPage":"984","endPage":"991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust STBC-Based Transmit Diversity Scheme for OFDM Systems Over Spatially Transmit Correlated Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Robust STBC-Based Transmit Diversity Scheme for OFDM Systems Over Spatially Transmit Correlated Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9382180","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4138029/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust STBC-Based Transmit Diversity Scheme for OFDM Systems Over Spatially Transmit Correlated Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt02-ko-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096126S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4137999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4137999","articleId":"4138029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4138034,"authors":[{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lie-Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279441800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4138034","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":123},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Pulse modulation","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Time domain analysis","Bandwidth","Data mining","System analysis and design","Signal detection","Fading","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","code division multiple access","Nakagami channels","pulse position modulation","signal detection","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-hopping multicarrier code-division multiple access","TH/MC-CDMA","time-domain pulse modulation","M-ary pulse-position modulation","power spectral density","PSD","single-user-based signal detection","subcarrier signal","flat Nakagami-m fading","additive white Gaussian noise","ultrawide-bandwidth communications","near-far resistant"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiple access (CDMA)","frequency\u2013time matrix","multicarrier (MC)","multiuser detection","Nakagami fading channels","power spectral density (PSD)","time-hopping (TH)","ultrawide-bandwidth (UWB) radio"]}],"abstract":"A time-hopping multicarrier code-division multiple-access (TH/MC-CDMA) scheme is proposed and investigated. In the proposed TH/MC-CDMA, each information symbol is transmitted by a number of time-domain pulses with each time-domain pulse modulating a subcarrier. The transmitted information at the receiver is extracted from one of the, say, M possible time-slot positions, i.e., assuming that M-ary pulse-position modulation is employed. Specifically, in this paper, we concentrate on the scenarios such as system design, power spectral density (PSD) and single-user-based signal detection. The error performance of the TH/MC-CDMA system is investigated when each subcarrier signal experiences flat Nakagami-m fading in addition to additive white Gaussian noise. According to our analysis and results, it can be shown that the TH/MC-CDMA signal is capable of providing a near ideal PSD, which is flat over the system bandwidth available, while decreasing rapidly beyond that bandwidth. Explicitly, signals having this type of PSD are beneficial to both broadband and ultrawide-bandwidth communications. Furthermore, our results show that when optimum user address codes are employed, the single-user detector considered is near-far resistant, provided that the number of users supported by the system is lower than the number of subcarriers used for conveying an information symbol","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2006.889577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4137999/04138034.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2006.889577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137999","startPage":"731","endPage":"741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Hopping Multicarrier Code-Division Multiple Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-Hopping Multicarrier Code-Division Multiple Access","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9382157","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Hopping Multicarrier Code-Division Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"56tvt02-lyang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050662S","chronDate":"March  2007","isNumber":"4137999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4138034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4138038,"authors":[{"name":"Sayandev Mukherjee","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4137999/4138038/4138038-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sayandev Mukherjee (S'92\u2013M'97\u2013SM'05) was born in Bangalore, India, in 1970.

Connections to SSs without a direct (i.e., a single hop) wireless connection to any BS are established, if possible, through other SSs serving as wireless repeaters. The locations of the SSs and the BSs follow independent homogeneous planar Poisson processes. The propagation channels exhibit signal attenuation with distance and log-normal shadowing. We evaluate exactly the probability of an SS to have a direct wireless connection to any of the BSs and a lower bound on the t-hop (t arbitrary) outage probability of an SS. We then define the minimal hop-count routing algorithm and calculate the mean number of hops for routes connecting SSs to BSs, when a maximum hop-count constraint is imposed. We compute next the probability distribution of the transmit power under the assumption of perfect power control.

A space-time equalizer is used in the first stage for joint coantenna/cochannel-interference suppression and shortening of the effective channel for each transmit stream of the desired user. The channel shortening, combined with independent detection, helps reduce the complexity of the second stage Viterbi equalizer, which is used for separate intersymbol-interference equalization for each of the streams. Three objective functions are proposed for determining the coefficients of the space-time equalizer using a direct training data-based approach, which does not require estimation of the interferer's channel.

The sampling scheme is based upon a second-order autoregressive (AR-2) model for the Rayleigh fading channel and a corresponding state-space representation in terms of fade and nonfade states. The threshold parameter that segments the fading signal into states is derived as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and a bit-error-rate performance metric. The sampling rates correspond to the values at which the mutual information of the process occupying a particular state, conditioned on two past observations of the channel, is maximized. The performance of the proposed sampling scheme in a model-based prediction algorithm is presented. The state of the received envelope is predicted with 98% accuracy. When applied to the estimation of channel gain, the sampling scheme in conjunction with a Kalman-filter-based AR-2 predictor yields one-step forecasts that accurately track the fading signal.

The proposed method unifies and generalizes the existing subspace-based methods for blind channel estimation in single-input single-output OFDM systems to blind channel estimation for two different MIMO-OFDM systems distinguished according to the number of transmit and receive antennas. In particular, the proposed method obtains accurate channel estimation and fast convergence with insensitivity to overestimates of the true channel order. If virtual carriers (VCs) are available, the proposed method can work with no or insufficient cyclic prefix (CP), thereby potentially increasing channel utilization. Furthermore, it is shown under specific system conditions that the proposed method can be applied to MIMO-OFDM systems without CPs, regardless of the presence of VCs, and obtains an accurate channel estimate with a small number of OFDM symbols.

However, they are very sensitive to nonlinear effects due to the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) owned by their transmitted signals. This paper proposes an efficient technique for reducing the PAPR of OFDM signals. The proposed technique is data-independent and, thus, does not require new processing and optimization for each transmitted OFDM block. The reduction in PAPR of the OFDM signal is obtained through a proper selection of a precoding scheme that distributes the power of each modulated symbol over the OFDM block. The obtained results show that this precoding scheme is an attractive solution to the PAPR problem of OFDM signals. It is shown, through computer simulations, that the PAPR of precoded OFDM signals approaches that of single-carrier signals. The good improvement in PAPR given by the present technique permits the reduction of the complexity and cost of the transmitter significantly. The precoding schemes also take advantage of the frequency variations of the communication channel and can provide considerable performance gain in fading-multipath channels","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4137999/04138047.pdf","startPage":"686","endPage":"695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.891409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.891409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of OFDM Signals Through Precoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Fading","Radio transmitters","Degradation","OFDM modulation","Computer simulation","Costs","Communication channels","Performance gain","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","equalisers","fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio","OFDM signals","orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing technique","broadband radio channels","multipath fading channel","communication channel equalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth efficiency","diversity gain","fading multipath","low complexity","orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","power efficiency","precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of OFDM Signals Through Precoding","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4138047/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9382152","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of OFDM Signals Through Precoding","sourcePdf":"56tvt02-slimane.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101451S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4137999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4137999","articleId":"4138047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4138053,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Xu","affiliation":["PINC Solutions, Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4137999/4138053/4138053-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing Xu received the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2000, 2005, and 2005, respectively.","He was an Intern at DaimlerChrysler Research and Technology Center North America and a Graduate Student Researcher at California Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways.

The so-called space-time weighted-nonbinary-repeat-accumulate (ST-WNRA) codes are considered in our paper due to their ability to provide a full transmit antenna diversity and their relatively simple encoding and decoding algorithms. Multipath diversity is obtained using a joint-over-antenna turbo-equalization technique based on the minimum-mean-square-error filtering with soft interference cancellation. Computer simulations demonstrate that our proposed turbo-equalized system with ST-WNRA codes is capable of achieving the maximum diversity order with a relatively short codeword length and that the multiuser performance approaches the single-user bound so far as the number of users is smaller than or equal to the number of receive antennas in multiuser MIMO setups. We will also show that by modifying our proposed scheme to an equivalent multilevel coded system, higher bandwidth efficiency can be achieved at the expense of a performance loss while the system still retains the maximum diversity benefit","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4137999/04138056.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.891441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.891441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Joint-Over-Antenna Detection and WNRA Decoding in Single-Carrier Multiuser MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Frequency diversity","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Filtering","Interference cancellation","Computer simulation","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","equalisers","filtering theory","interference suppression","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative joint-over-antenna detection","WNRA decoding","single-carrier multiuser MIMO systems","maximum diversity","single-carrier multiple-input-multiple-output","frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","receive antennas","multipath components","space-time weighted-nonbinary-repeat-accumulate codes","transmit antenna diversity","joint-over-antenna turbo-equalization","minimum-mean-square-error filtering","soft interference cancellation","multilevel coded system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative decoding","multilevel coding","m ultiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems","repeat-accumulate codes","turbo equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Joint-Over-Antenna Detection and WNRA Decoding in Single-Carrier Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4138056/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9382158","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Joint-Over-Antenna Detection and WNRA Decoding in Single-Carrier Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"56tvt02-yen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103806S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4137999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4137999","articleId":"4138056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4138057,"authors":[{"name":"Wai-Leong Yeow","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4137999/4138057/4138057-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wai-Leong Yeow (S'04) received the B.Eng. degree (first-class honors) in computer engineering from National University of Singapore (NUS), Kent Ridge, Singapore, in July 2003, where he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree under the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR) Graduate Scholarship since August 2003.","His research interests include communication issues in wireless sensor networks, especially their applications in target tracking, and distributed decision-making algorithms."]},"firstName":"Wai-Leong","lastName":"Yeow","id":"37295195800"},{"name":"Chen-Khong Tham","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4137999/4138057/4138057-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Chen-Khong Tham (S'92\u2013M'95) received the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and information sciences engineering, both from University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K.","He currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), National University of Singapore (NUS), Kent Ridge, Singapore.

This paper looks into efficient energy utilization of a target-tracking sensor network by predicting a target's trajectory through experience. While this is not new, the chief novelty comes in conserving energy through both dynamic spatial and temporal management of sensors while assuming minimal locality information. We adapted our target trajectory model from the Gauss-Markov mobility model, formulated the tracking problem as a hierarchical Markov decision process (HMDP), and solved it through neurodynamic programming. Our HMDP for target-tracking (HMTT) algorithm conserves energy by reducing the rate of sensing (temporal management) but maintains an acceptable tracking accuracy through trajectory prediction (spatial management) of multiple targets. We derived some theoretical bounds on accuracy and energy utilization of HMTT. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of HMTT in energy conservation and tracking accuracy against two other predictive tracking algorithms, with accuracy of up to 47% higher and energy savings of up to 200%","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.891480","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4137999/04138057.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4137999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.891480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"918","endPage":"928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Multiple Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Multiple Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138057/","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4138057/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9382173","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Multiple Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"56tvt02-yeow.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092968S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4137999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4137999","articleId":"4138057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4138112,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Ghoreishi Madiseh","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Masoud Ghoreishi","lastName":"Madiseh","id":"37294459900"},{"name":"Ali Shahzadi","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Shahzadi","id":"37294461600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2796-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4138112","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Transmitters","Partial transmit sequences","Time domain analysis","Newton method","Constraint optimization","Constellation diagram","Optimization methods","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","Newton method","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM PAPR reduction","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","interior point method","convex optimization","constellation error vector magnitude","802.11a/g wireless local-area network","binary-phase-shift keying","QAM","hybrid Newton method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convex Optimization","OFDM","PAPR","Interior-Point-Method (IPM)","IFFT","EVM","Newton Method"]}],"abstract":"The main problem of OFDM signaling is the high peak-to-average power ratio in time domain that limits transmitter amplifier power efficiency.

A major part of the proposed PMEPR reduction schemes is carry out on base band signals. In order to implement a digital modulator, an oversampled version of the continuous signal which would be generated by the analog modulator is required. This oversampling function is equivalent to add blocks of null symbols in the frequency domain. Referring to the pioneer work of [2], these blocks of null symbols will be called \"Ghost Carriers\". In this paper, we combine a Constraint Second Order Cone Program (C-SOCP) formulation with Ghost Carriers to reduce even more the PMEPR. As the Ghost Carriers (GC) are Out-Of-Band (OOB) carriers, the amount of OOB power should respects the spectrum mask specified in the standard. We show in this paper that with constraints on the increase of the mean power, the OOB power respects the spectrum mask. Therefore the proposed peak reduction scheme is formulated as a convex optimization problem with constraints on the increase of the mean power. The results are presented for the 802.11a standard.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of OFDM Peak to Mean Envelope Power Ratio Using Ghost Carriers.","publicationTitle":"2007 Third International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'07)","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2007.73","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Third International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4138098/4138099/04138142.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2007.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4138099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of OFDM Peak to Mean Envelope Power Ratio Using Ghost Carriers.","conferenceDate":"4-9 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4138142/","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9857740","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of OFDM Peak to Mean Envelope Power Ratio Using Ghost Carriers.","confLoc":"Guadeloupe, French Caribbean","sourcePdf":"27960037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05226S","chronDate":"4-9 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4138098","isNumber":"4138099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4138098","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4138099","articleId":"4138142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4138143,"authors":[{"name":"Darryn Lowe","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Darryn","lastName":"Lowe","id":"37300661200"},{"name":"Xiaojing Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293558100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2796-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4138143","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Ultra wideband technology","Personal area networks","FCC","OFDM","Interleaved codes","Interference","Convolutional codes","Transmitters","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","convolutional codes","interference (signal)","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive time-frequency codes","ultrawideband","interpiconet interference","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MB-OFDM","data-rate-speciflc punctured convolutional codes","simultaneous operating piconets","packet error rates","transmitter"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates inter-piconet interference (IPI) in the multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) standard.

The receiver consists of a FD MMSE Equalizer and a Time Domain (TD) decoder with iterative information exchange between the two functions. In particular, we propose a FD MMSE equalizer derivation improved from previous approaches, in that feedback and feedforward filters are directly derived in the frequency-domain. The accuracy of the proposed approach is confirmed by comparing the lower bound of the iterative equalizing process with the corresponding analytical results proposed in previous paper. Simulations over multi- path Rayleigh block fading channels show that the resulting algorithm exhibits similar performance with that of the corresponding TD MMSE equalization. The problem of finding the TD filter achieving the best compromise between minimum impulse response length and performance is considered.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2007.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4138099","publicationTitle":"2007 Third International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Third International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4138098/4138099/04138171.pdf","endPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Frequency-Domain MMSE Turbo Equalization Derivation and Performance Comparison with the Time-Domain Counterpart","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2007.38","startPage":"65","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Frequency-Domain MMSE Turbo Equalization Derivation and Performance Comparison with the Time-Domain Counterpart","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138171/","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9857769","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4138171/","conferenceDate":"4-9 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Frequency-Domain MMSE Turbo Equalization Derivation and Performance Comparison with the Time-Domain Counterpart","confLoc":"Guadeloupe, French Caribbean","sourcePdf":"27960065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055394S","chronDate":"4-9 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4138098","isNumber":"4138099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4138098","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4138099","articleId":"4138171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4138173,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim S.

Rather, it is often more important to make sure that those anomalies that are reported to the user are in fact interesting. If too many unremarkable data points are returned to the user labeled as candidate anomalies, the software can soon fall into disuse. One way to ensure that returned anomalies are useful is to make use of domain knowledge provided by the user. Often, the data in question includes a set of environmental attributes whose values a user would never consider to be directly indicative of an anomaly. However, such attributes cannot be ignored because they have a direct effect on the expected distribution of the result attributes whose values can indicate an anomalous observation. This paper describes a general purpose method called conditional anomaly detection for taking such differences among attributes into account, and proposes three different expectation-maximization algorithms for learning the model that is used in conditional anomaly detection.

As major DBMSs now all support expensive user-defined predicates for Boolean queries, we believe such support for ranked queries can be even more important: first, ranked queries often need to model user-specific concepts of preference, relevance, or similarity, which call for dynamic user-defined functions. Second, middleware systems must incorporate external predicates for integrating autonomous sources typically accessible only by per-object queries. Third, ranked queries often accompany Boolean ranking conditions, which may turn predicates into expensive ones, as the index structure on the predicate built on the base table may be no longer effective in retrieving the filtered objects in order. Fourth, fuzzy joins are inherently expensive, as they are essentially user-defined operations that dynamically associate multiple relations. These predicates, being dynamically defined or externally accessed, cannot rely on index mechanisms to provide zero-time sorted output, and must instead require per-object probe to evaluate. To enable probe minimization, we develop the problem as cost-based optimization of searching over potential probe schedules. In particular, we decouple probe scheduling into object and predicate scheduling problems and develop an analytical object scheduling optimization and a dynamic predicate scheduling optimization, which combined together form a cost-effective probe schedule","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4138195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4138195/04138202.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2007.1007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2007.1007","startPage":"646","endPage":"662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probe Minimization by Schedule Optimization: Supporting Top-K Queries with Expensive Predicates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138202/","displayDocTitle":"Probe Minimization by Schedule Optimization: Supporting Top-K Queries with Expensive Predicates","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4138202/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"9415658","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probe Minimization by Schedule Optimization: Supporting Top-K Queries with Expensive Predicates","sourcePdf":"k0646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091056S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4138195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4138195","articleId":"4138202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4138240,"authors":[{"name":"Heinz J.

But terminating the mesh accurately at a finite distance from the body in case of an open problem is a major challenge. Though there are several techniques presented before, this new method is different from the methods given in [1]-[2]. This new approach allows for the terminating surface to encapsulate the body very tightly. In this proposed method, finite element technique is used for open region problems whereas integral equation solution approach using Green's function is applied to enforce the radiation condition. At each iteration cycle, field sources within the domain are evaluated and their potential at the terminating surface is calculated. The proposed method leads to increased computational efficiency, of finite element method. It can be generalized for the case of inhomogeneous and nonlinear media, for static and dynamic fields. Typical numerical results are presented for the solution of Laplace's equation to illustrate the accuracy of the technique.","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1994.337272","publicationTitle":"1994 24th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 24th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4138235/4138236/04138317.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1994.337272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4138236","startPage":"579","endPage":"584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Method for Accurate and Efficient Mesh Termination for FEM (Electrostatic Case)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Method for Accurate and Efficient Mesh Termination for FEM (Electrostatic Case)","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138317/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Method for Accurate and Efficient Mesh Termination for FEM (Electrostatic Case)","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"EUMA-1-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032871S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","isNumber":"4138236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4138235","articleId":"4138317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4138326,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A comparison with the results obtained from analytic solutions, for complex weights, element phases, or element positions, shows some advantage of using the genetic algorithm approach for null steering in linear array patterns.

One key feature of the MTA based measurement system is that during power sweeps the harmonic behavior, up to 40 GHz, can be measured. To improve the accuracy of power measurements the vector measurement capability of the MTA is also utilized to allow full vector calibration of the measurement system. In addition, this vector measurement feature allows both the input reflection and the transmission coefficients of a device under test (DUT) to be measured as a function of frequency and input power. The input and output voltage waveforms at the transistor terminals are also calculated from the measurement data. This improved capability is possible since the vector calibrated measurement system allows both the measurement of the fundamental and the higher harmonics with respect to magnitude and phase.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Vector Corrected High Power On-Wafer Measurement System with a Frequency Range for the Higher Harmomcs up to 40 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Vector Corrected High Power On-Wafer Measurement System with a Frequency Range for the Higher Harmomcs up to 40 GHz","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"EUMA-2-67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063972S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 1994","isNumber":"4138385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4138235","citationCount":"58","articleId":"4138452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4138467,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These models have been implemented in our HP-MDS data base, resulting in accurate designs of a number of millimeter wave circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138793/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 Sept. 1996","volume":"2","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","conferenceDate":"6-13 Sept. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Models of coplanar lines and elements over the frequency range 0-120 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models of coplanar lines and elements over the frequency range 0-120 GHz","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"EUMA-2-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035871S","chronDate":"6-13 Sept. 1996","isNumber":"4138685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4138558","citationCount":"29","articleId":"4138793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4138812,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Musch","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Ruhr Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Musch","id":"37300085700"},{"name":"Burkhard Schiek","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Ruhr Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Burkhard","lastName":"Schiek","id":"37301131700"}],"articleNumber":"4138812","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":359},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Timing","Frequency synchronization","Chirp modulation","Circuit synthesis","Circuit simulation","Linearity","Frequency modulation","Frequency measurement","Circuit optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138812","abstract":"A high precision analog frequency-ramp-generator has been developed.

In this summary, the application of LE-FDTD algorithm to the analysis of a simple oscillator is described: the circuit has been realized and enclosed in a compact package, so that the oscillator performances critically depends on the package itself. By exploiting the inherent versatility of the LE-FDTD method, circuit-package interactions can be reliably investigated. Both the peculiarities of such an approach are therefore profitably exploited: treatment of non-linear components (which are essential for the oscillator behavior) and full-wave account of electromagnetic propagation (needed to accurately describe the tight coupling between package and circuit). Simulation results are compared with actual measurements, highlighting the LE-FDTD ability of correctly predicting the oscillator behavior, even in operating conditions which falls outside the applications range of conventional circuit simulators.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of tight Circuit-Package coupling by using the Lumped-Element FDTD Method","publicationTitle":"1997 27th European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1997.337894","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 27th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4138799/4138918/04138946.pdf","startPage":"810","endPage":"819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1997.337894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4138918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4138946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4138946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of tight Circuit-Package coupling by using the Lumped-Element FDTD Method","conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of tight Circuit-Package coupling by using the Lumped-Element FDTD Method","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"EUMA-2-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045989S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 1997","isNumber":"4138918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4138799","articleId":"4138946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4138956,"authors":[{"name":"Samir M.

The proposed technique provides reliable neural transistor models, while significantly reducing the cost effort and complexity involved in the modeling of HBT.","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1998.338005","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","publicationTitle":"1998 28th European Microwave Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1998.338005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4139036","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 28th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4139035/4139036/04139092.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Approach to the Modeling of Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors from S-Parameter Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4139092/","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Approach to the Modeling of Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors from S-Parameter Data","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Approach to the Modeling of Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors from S-Parameter Data","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EUMA-1-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026998S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"4139036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4139035","citationCount":"14","articleId":"4139092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4139118,"authors":[{"name":"T.

As a result, such a combination appears like a convenient solution for improving the performances of the basic antenna. To overcome technological constraints, we show that an optimum approach consists in the use of a multi-layer, multi-technology process.

A 750-kHz annular array was aligned confocally with a 4.5 MHz passive backscatter receiver during ex vivo insonation of porcine myocardium. Various exposure conditions were used to elicit a range of damage morphologies and backscatter characteristics [pulse duration = 14 mus, pulse repetition frequency (PRF) = 0.07-3.1 kHz, average I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SPPA</sub>\n = 22-44 kW/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n]. Variability in backscatter spatial localization was quantified by tracking the lag required to achieve peak correlation between sequential RF A-lines received. Mean spatial variability was observed to be significantly higher when damage morphology consisted of mechanically disrupted tissue homogenate versus mechanically intact coagulation necrosis (2.35 plusmn 1.59 mm versus 0.067 plusmn 0.054 mm, p < 0.025). Statistics from these variability distributions were used as the basis for selecting a threshold variability level to identify the onset of homogenate formation via an abrupt, sustained increase in spatially dynamic backscatter activity. Specific indices indicative of the state of the homogenization process were quantified as a function of acoustic input conditions.

Moreover, the parasitic substrate coupling calls for shielding measures whose effectiveness at very high frequencies must be carefully checked as well. Therefore, in this paper a procedure for substrate modeling is described that has already been applied successfully in practice. For this, the numerical simulator SUSI has been developed and used to calculate the behavior of the substrate from the layout and from technological data. It has been verified by on-wafer measurements up to 40 GHz, as will be shown here for long-and short-distance substrate coupling with and without shielding. As an important application of SUSI, the reduction of substrate coupling by guard rings or by a, channel stopper layer is demonstrated. It is shown that shielding measures, however, can lose their effectiveness at very high frequencies due to the parasitic inductance of their metalization. Moreover, the results of the numerical simulation can be used to derive equivalent circuits which are necessary to model the influence of the substrate in circuit simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4139457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of Substrate Coupling with Special Regard to Shielding in High-Speed Si/SiGe Bipolar ICs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of Substrate Coupling with Special Regard to Shielding in High-Speed Si/SiGe Bipolar ICs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"EUMA-2-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027519S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"4139421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4139351","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4139457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4139459,"authors":[{"name":"L.

A simple case, but one of practical interest, of propagation scenario is considered, where a mobile receiver was moved through shadowing and line of sight (LOS) channel conditions in the presence of a semi-infinite half-plane. The propagation characteristics include the signal attenuation, Doppler spread and various first order and second order statistical characteristics such as cumulative distribution function (cdf), level crossing rate (Icr) of the fading signal. Also, the frequency selective fading behaviour was studied in terms of mean excess delay, rms delay spread at various mobile positions using channel frequency response over a range of 27.5 GHz to 31.5 GHz frequency band. These characteristics provide valuable information on the area coverage, selection of optimum transmitter location, the choice of suitable packet duration and data rates for the satisfactory performance of digital communication system. The results are obtained using two prediction models, namely the asymptotic path integral technique and ray tracing technique using uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) and are validated by comparing with each other.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of Propagation Channel in the Presence of an Imperfect Semi-Infinite Half-Plane using Asymptotic Path Integral and Ray Tracing Techniques","publicationTitle":"1999 29th European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/EUMA.1999.338465","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 29th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4139351/4139421/04139494.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMA.1999.338465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4139421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4139494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4139494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Propagation Channel in the Presence of an Imperfect Semi-Infinite Half-Plane using Asymptotic Path Integral and Ray Tracing Techniques","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Propagation Channel in the Presence of an Imperfect Semi-Infinite Half-Plane using Asymptotic Path Integral and Ray Tracing Techniques","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"EUMA-2-73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029057S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"4139421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4139351","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4139494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4139497,"authors":[{"name":"Kazutomi Mori","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazutomi","lastName":"Mori","id":"37276437700"},{"name":"Kenichirou Choumei","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichirou","lastName":"Choumei","id":"37300050700"},{"name":"Teruyuki Shimura","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Teruyuki","lastName":"Shimura","id":"37270604400"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Asada","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Asada","id":"37288520000"},{"name":"Toshio Okuda","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Okuda","id":"37285908500"},{"name":"Kazuya Yamamoto","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuya","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37278472800"},{"name":"Takeshi Miura","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Miura","id":"37302090400"},{"name":"Ryo Hattori","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Hattori","id":"37286518600"},{"name":"Tadashi Takagi","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Takagi","id":"37276714200"},{"name":"Yukio Ikeda","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukio","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37272916800"}],"articleNumber":"4139497","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"abstract":"A GSM900/1800 Dual-Band AlGaAs/GaAs HBT(Hetero-junction Bipolar Transistor) MMIC power amplifier has been developed.
