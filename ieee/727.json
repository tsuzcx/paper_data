There have been successes and failures, but ultimately with each new advance in technology there has been a struggle between the content providers and the content consumers. Content providers, desperate to retain their ability to monetize expensive rights-based assets, are suspicious of new open platform technologies. Consumers are wary of closed technologies, having been hurt in the past by countless format wars and technology races. Looking to the music industry, we can see just how badly things can go wrong when the business model does not keep pace with advances in technology. This paper examines recent developments in disruptive cloud computing platform, including the foundation technologies that have made this possible, such as hypervisors, virtualization, hardware abstraction, and data center automation. From these foundation technologies, platforms such as Amazon's Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2), and Microsoft Azure have evolved; current status and likely future developments are examined. Building from this analysis, how current broadcast products that are already utilizing these cloud platforms in isolation is discussed. The way in which next-generation system integration, at the software level, can bring these products together into a coherent solution for broadcasters with the capability to reduce costs and improve time-to-market for new channels and services is also examined. The paper concludes with an assessment of the market opportunity for this new technology and an identification of current gap technologies and services in this new sector.","doi":"10.5594/j18017XY","publicationTitle":"SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7261654/7270118/07270130.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/j18017XY","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Silver Lining\u2014Utilizing Cloud Computing in Broadcast Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"The Silver Lining\u2014Utilizing Cloud Computing in Broadcast Applications","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","publicationDate":"March 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"120","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Silver Lining\u2014Utilizing Cloud Computing in Broadcast Applications","sourcePdf":"i1545-0279-120-2-30.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045901S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"7270118","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7261654","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7270130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7270240,"authors":[{"name":"Jatinder Singh","affiliation":["University of Cambridge"],"bio":{"p":["JATINDER SINGH is a senior research associate in the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.

The proposed technique exploits wide-angle and/or multi-angle observations for image resolution enhancement. We first introduce a forward model based on sparse synthetic apertures. The problem of sparse scatterer imaging is formulated as an optimization problem of reconstructing group sparse signals. A logistic Gaussian kernel model, which involves a logistic function and location-dependent Gaussian kernel, and takes the correlation between entire scatterers into account, is then used to encourage the underlying continuity structure of illuminated target scene in a nonparametric Bayesian learning framework. The posterior inference of the proposed method is then provided in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme. The proposed technique enables high-resolution SAR imaging in wide-angle as well as multi-angle observation systems, and the imaging performance is improved by exploiting the underlying structure of the target scene. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in preserving the continuous structure and suppressing isolated components over existing state-of-the-art compressive sensing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal

repeat request (HARQ) transmission scheme which is based on pruned convolutional codes (CCs) and supports unequal error protection (UEP). The data to be transmitted is assumed to consist of important bits (IB) and standard bits (SB). In the proposed scheme, all the bits are first encoded using a single mother CC and transmitted over the channel. If a decoding error is detected in the IB, then retransmission of only the IB takes place using a CC, typically with a better error correction capability. Next, taking advantage of the properties of pruned CCs, the decoded IB are used to increase the decoding reliability for the SB. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed scheme offers strong protection for the IB along with improved reliability for the remaining bits compared to other UEP schemes.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2479236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7349260/07270257.pdf","startPage":"2062","endPage":"2065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2479236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to UEP-HARQ via Convolutional Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270257/","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to UEP-HARQ via Convolutional Codes","volume":"19","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661653","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7270257/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Israeli Science Foundation","grantNumber":"396/11."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to UEP-HARQ via Convolutional Codes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-murin-2479236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068771S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7349260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7349260","articleId":"7270257","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7270273,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In EONs, an optical connection is allocated by solving the problem of routing and spectrum assignment (RSA). Based on the RSA output, a portion of spectrum-whose width depends on transmission parameters (e.g., bit rate and modulation format)-is assigned to an optical connection along a computed route. New emerging techniques for distance adaptation, that exploit variable code, are under investigation. In this case, the code rate (or redundancy) is tuned depending on the required optical reach. In EONs, transponders supporting distance adaptation permit to trade off between optical reach and required bandwidth (e.g., through the adaptation of modulation format), so that the spectrum occupied by a connection can be minimized while guaranteeing the required optical reach. This paper presents the concept of code selection in RSA for EONs, by proposing a routing, code, and spectrum assignment (RCSA) for dynamic set up. According to RCSA, a path, a code, and a portion of spectrum are selected for a connection request while guaranteeing quality of transmission. RCSA considers transmission impairments (e.g., amplified spontaneous emission) and filtering effects.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2479362","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7332227/07270273.pdf","startPage":"5114","endPage":"5121","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2479362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7332227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing Code and Spectrum Assignment (RCSA) in Elastic Optical Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Routing Code and Spectrum Assignment (RCSA) in Elastic Optical Networks","volume":"33","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15615645","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7270273/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FP-7 IDEALIST Project","grantNumber":"317999"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing Code and Spectrum Assignment (RCSA) in Elastic Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-sambo-2479362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125206S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7332227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7332227","articleId":"7270273","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7270280,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7270280/qiu-2479456-small.gif","p":["Qiang Qiu received the bachelor\u2019s (Hons.) degree in computer science in 2001, the master\u2019s degree in computer science from the National University of Singapore, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2012.

The key idea of our approach is to force domain-invariant sparse coding, i.e., designing a consistent sparse representation of the same face in different domains. In this way, the classifiers trained on the sparse codes in the source domain consisting of frontal faces can be applied to the target domain (consisting of faces in different poses, illumination conditions, and so on) without much loss in recognition accuracy. The approach is to first learn a domain base dictionary, and then describe each domain shift (identity, pose, and illumination) using a sparse representation over the base dictionary. The dictionary adapted to each domain is expressed as the sparse linear combinations of the base dictionary. In the context of face recognition, with the proposed compositional dictionary approach, a face image can be decomposed into sparse representations for a given subject, pose, and illumination. This approach has three advantages. First, the extracted sparse representation for a subject is consistent across domains, and enables pose and illumination insensitive face recognition. Second, sparse representations for pose and illumination can be subsequently used to estimate the pose and illumination condition of a face image. Last, by composing sparse representations for the subject and the different domains, we can also perform pose alignment and illumination normalization. Extensive experiments using two public face data sets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for face recognition.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270280","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Face","Dictionaries","Face recognition","Tensile stress","Matrix decomposition","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compositional dictionaries","domain adaptive face recognition","dictionary learning approach","sparse representation","frontal faces","sparse linear combinations","pose estimation","illumination normalization","pose alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Recognition","Domain Adaption","Sparse Representation","Pose Alignment","Illumination Normalization","Multilinear Image Analysis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Face","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Machine Learning","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]},{"kwd":["Face recognition","domain adaption","sparse representation","pose alignment","illumination normalization","multilinear image analysis"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07270280.pdf","startPage":"5152","endPage":"5165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2479456","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2479456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compositional Dictionaries for Domain Adaptive Face Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270280/","displayDocTitle":"Compositional Dictionaries for Domain Adaptive Face Recognition","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15484416","pubMedId":"26390461","htmlLink":"/document/7270280/","volume":"24","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Office of Naval Research within the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative","grantNumber":"N00014-10-1-0934"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compositional Dictionaries for Domain Adaptive Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-qiu-2479456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156112S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7270280","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7270281,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7284722/7270281/zheng-2470544-small.gif","p":["Li Zheng received the B.S. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006, and the M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.","His current research interests include microfluidic cooling, off-chip signaling, and power delivery for high-performance silicon interposer and 3-D integrated systems."]},"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38542830800"},{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7284722/7270281/zhang-2470544-small.gif","p":["Yang Zhang (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics and mathematics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2012.

The key advantage of the the silicon interposer is its very fine-pitch wiring, which enables high-bandwidth off-chip signaling for the chips assembled on the silicon interposer. Compared with conventional air cooling, embedded microfuidic cooling is used for better cooling and thermal isolation of chips on the silicon interposer. A test vehicle consisting of a silicon interposer and a silicon dice with microfluidic I/Os and embedded microfluidic heat sinks is fabricated and assembled for thermal measurements. At a flow rate of 50 mL/min, the measured temperature is 55.9\u00b0C for a power density of 97 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, which represents a normalized thermal resistance of 0.24 K \u00b7 cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n/W. The thermal simulations based on the measured thermal resistance show that 40.1% reduction in the silicon interposer temperature is achieved with microfluidic cooling compared to air cooling. Moreover, thermal coupling between the dice on the silicon interposer is significantly reduced with microfluidic cooling, which significantly benefits the integration density and the signaling performance by integrating chips more closely and reducing interconnect length.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7284722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7284722/07270281.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2470544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2470544","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Silicon Interposer Platform Utilizing Microfluidic Cooling for High-Performance Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270281/","displayDocTitle":"A Silicon Interposer Platform Utilizing Microfluidic Cooling for High-Performance Computing Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7270281/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"15489375","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) through the DARPA ICECool Fundamentals and Applications","grantNumber":"W31P4Q-12-1-0014 and HR0011-14-1-0002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Silicon Interposer Platform Utilizing Microfluidic Cooling for High-Performance Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-zheng-2470544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05418S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7284722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7284722","articleId":"7270281","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7270287,"authors":[{"name":"Renlong Hang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7386543/7270287/hang-2465899-small.gif","p":["\n\nRenlong Hang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

Many previous studies have been devoted to this subject. However, these methods often regard the spatial-spectral high-dimensional data as 1-D vector and then extract informative features for classification. In this paper, we propose a new HS image classification method. Specifically, matrix-based spatial-spectral feature representation is designed for each pixel to capture the local spatial contextual and the spectral information of all the bands, which can well preserve the spatial-spectral correlation. Then, matrix-based discriminant analysis is adopted to learn the discriminative feature subspace for classification. To further improve the performance of discriminative subspace, a random sampling technique is used to produce a subspace ensemble for final HS image classification. Experiments are conducted on three HS remote sensing data sets acquired by different sensors, and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15720413","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7270287/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Matrix-Based Discriminant Subspace Ensemble for Hyperspectral Image Spatial\u2013Spectral Feature Fusion","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272223, 61300162, 61532009 and 41501377"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK2012045, BK20131003 and 15KJA520001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix-Based Discriminant Subspace Ensemble for Hyperspectral Image Spatial\u2013Spectral Feature Fusion","sourcePdf":"tgrs-hang-2465899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16603S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7386543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7386543","articleId":"7270287","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7270288,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Ettorre","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes (IETR), UMR CNRS 6164, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7312523/7270288/ettor-2479243-small.gif","p":["Mauro Ettorre (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201915) was born in Matera, Italy, in 1979.

The design procedure, the fabrication, and an exhaustive antenna characterization are described in details. The array comprises 16 radiating slots and is fed by a corporate-feed network in hollow parallel plate waveguide (PPW) technology. A pillbox-based linear source illuminates the corporate network and allows for beam steering. The antenna is designed by using an ad hoc mode matching code recently developed for CTS arrays, providing design guidelines. The assembly technique ensures the electrical contact among the various stages of the network without using any electromagnetic choke and any bonding process. The main beam of the antenna is mechanically steered over \u00b140\u00b0 in elevation, by moving a compact horn within the focal plane of the pillbox feeding system. Excellent performances are achieved. The features of the beam are stable within the design 27.5-31 GHz band and beyond, in the entire Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz). An antenna gain of about 29 dBi is measured at broadside at 29.25 GHz and scan losses lower than 2 dB are reported at \u00b140\u00b0. The antenna efficiency exceeds 80% in the whole scan range. The very good agreement between measurements and simulations validates the design procedure. The proposed design is suitable for Satcom Ka-band terminals in moving platforms, e.g., trains and planes, and also for mobile ground stations, as a multibeam sectorial antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7312523/07270288.pdf","startPage":"4792","endPage":"4800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2479243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2479243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Transverse Stub Array for Ka-Band Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Impedance","Ports (Computers)","Antenna measurements","Antenna arrays","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave antenna arrays","waveguide antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency 27.5 GHz to 31 GHz","multibeam sectorial antenna","Satcom Ka-band terminals","electromagnetic choke","ad hoc mode matching code","beam steering","pillbox-based linear source","hollow parallel plate waveguide technology","corporate-feed network","broadband continuous transverse stub array","Ka-band applications","continuous transverse stub array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["slot arrays","waveguide arrays","broadband antennas","multibeam antennas","parallel plate waveguide"]},{"kwd":["Broadband antennas","multibeam antennas","parallel plate waveguide (PPW)","slot arrays","waveguide arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Transverse Stub Array for Ka-Band Applications","volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7270288/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568448","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002830","fundingName":"CNES"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Transverse Stub Array for Ka-Band Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-ettorre-2479243-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.395201S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7312523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7312523","articleId":"7270288","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7270295,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7270295/li-2479400-small.gif","p":["Bing Li received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, China, in 2009.

As an important form of expression, horror images have their own characteristics that can evoke extreme emotions. In this paper, we present a novel context-aware multi-instance learning (CMIL) algorithm for horror image recognition. The CMIL algorithm identifies horror images and picks out the regions that cause the sensation of horror in these horror images. It obtains contextual cues among adjacent regions in an image using a random walk on a contextual graph. Borrowing the strength of the fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM), we define a heuristic optimization procedure based on the FSVM to search for the optimal classifier for the CMIL. To improve the initialization of the CMIL, we propose a novel visual saliency model based on the tensor analysis. The average saliency value of each segmented region is set as its initial fuzzy membership in the CMIL. The advantage of the tensor-based visual saliency model is that it not only adaptively selects features, but also dynamically determines fusion weights for saliency value combination from different feature subspaces. The effectiveness of the proposed CMIL model is demonstrated by its use in horror image recognition on two large-scale image sets collected from the Internet.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07270295.pdf","startPage":"5193","endPage":"5205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Horror Image Recognition Based on Context-Aware Multi-Instance Learning","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2479400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2479400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Horror Image Recognition Based on Context-Aware Multi-Instance Learning","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15499157","pubMedId":"26390459","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7270295/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China the 973 Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"No. 61370038, 61472421, 61571045 and No. 2014CB349303"},{"fundingName":"CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, and Chinese National Programs for High Technology Research and Development (863 Program)","grantNumber":"No.2012AA012503 and No. 2012AA012504"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Horror Image Recognition Based on Context-Aware Multi-Instance Learning","sourcePdf":"tip-hu-2479400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105567S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7270295","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7270307,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Lin","affiliation":["State Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/7499900/7270307/lin-2479195-small.gif","p":["\n\nHong Lin was born in 1980.

Most existing results for this setup are concerned with the design of controller, while the optimal estimation and its performance evaluation have been rarely treated. In this paper, we show that, unlike many other cases such as intermittent observations or TCP-like systems, the system state follows a Gaussian mixture distribution with exponentially increasing terms, which leads to a Gaussian sum filter-based optimal estimation. We develop an auxiliary estimator method to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the mean estimation error covariance matrices. It is revealed that the stability is independent of the packet loss rate, and is not affected by the lack of acknowledgment. A suboptimal filtering algorithm with improved computational efficiency is then developed. Numerical examples and simulations are employed to illustrate the theoretical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/7499900/07270307.pdf","startPage":"1794","endPage":"1809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2015.2479195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2015.2479195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499900","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Estimation in UDP-Like Networked Control Systems With Intermittent Inputs: Stability Analysis and Suboptimal Filter Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Stability analysis","Packet loss","Random variables","Numerical stability","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","covariance matrices","Gaussian distribution","mixture models","networked control systems","stability","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UDP-like networked control systems","stability analysis","suboptimal filter design","optimal estimation problem","lossy networked control systems","control packets","TCP-like systems","Gaussian mixture distribution","Gaussian sum filter-based optimal estimation","auxiliary estimator method","mean estimation error covariance matrices","packet loss rate","suboptimal filtering algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["networked control systems","optimal estimation","intermittent inputs","packet loss","stability"]},{"kwd":["Intermittent inputs","networked control systems (NCSs)","optimal estimation","packet loss","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Estimation in UDP-Like Networked Control Systems With Intermittent Inputs: Stability Analysis and Suboptimal Filter Design","volume":"61","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7270307/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16105280","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of P.R.

The optimization of the system can be further enhanced by exploiting relative importance of moving objects in remote surveillance applications. This paper presents an energy-efficient wireless video sensor node for remote surveillance using content-aware pre-processing and an energy- and content-aware feedback control scheme. A low-overhead pre-processing engine detects the region of interest (ROI) in a frame defined as the macroblocks with moving objects, and an encoder selectively processes ROI macroblocks, resulting in reduction of both computation and transmission energy with minimum quality degradation of the ROI. We also propose an energy- and content-aware control scheme that jointly tunes the system parameters to maintain target transmission energy with minimum degradation of the ROI quality under varying wireless channel conditions. Compared to conventional encoding approaches, the proposed design consumes up to 56 percent less energy at the same quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/7294742/07270315.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2478469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2478469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Wireless Video Sensor Node for Moving Object Surveillance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Transmitters","Streaming media","Feedback control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image sensors","motion estimation","video coding","video surveillance","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient wireless video sensor node","moving object surveillance","encoder parameter","transmitter parameter","video quality","energy consumption","variable channel conditions","system optimization","remote surveillance applications","content-aware preprocessing","energy-aware feedback control scheme","content-aware feedback control scheme","low-overhead preprocessing engine","region-of-interest detection","ROI macroblock detection","computation energy","transmission energy","minimum quality degradation","system parameters","target transmission energy","ROI quality","wireless channel conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content-aware","Energy-aware","Pre-processing","Region-of-interest","Wireless video sensor"]},{"kwd":["Content-aware","energy-aware","pre-processing","region-of-interest","wireless video sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Wireless Video Sensor Node for Moving Object Surveillance","volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7270315/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2015","accessionNumber":"15540010","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient Wireless Video Sensor Node for Moving Object Surveillance","sourcePdf":"tmscs-ko-2478469-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091158S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7294742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7294742","articleId":"7270315","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7270316,"authors":[{"name":"Melek Ertogan","affiliation":["Marine Engineering Department, Maritime Faculty, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7422867/7270316/ertog-small.gif","p":["Melek Ertogan received the B.Sc. degree from the Naval Architecture\n and Marine Engineering Department, the M.Sc. degree from the Naval Architecture Department, and the Ph.D. degree from\n the Mechanical Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 1998, 2003, and 2012,\n respectively.","She was a Naval Architecture and Marine Engineer in the industry.

Such principles apply to any WPT system comprising three orthogonal transmitter coils and multiple receivers with coil resonators. A current amplitude control method capable of generating a magnetic vector at a set of points evenly distributed on a spherical surface is explained. Based on the voltage and the current information in the transmitter circuit, the power involved in each vector over the spherical surface can be obtained. By scanning the vector over the spherical surface, the collective power flow requirements for the targeted loads can be determined. Based on the power requirements for the vectors over the spherical surface, a weighted time-sharing scheme is adopted to focus the wireless power toward the targeted areas. This method has been successfully applied to a hardware prototype.

multiple-eavesdropper (MIMOME) wiretap system. The problem is studied with an artificial noise (AN)-aided precoding scheme. First, we place AN in the null space of the legitimate receiver's channel matrix and formulate a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem, which is subject to both an interference power constraint imposed to protect the primary user (PU) and a maximum transmit power constraint available for the secondary transmitter. Second, we drop the null space constraint and reformulate the SRM problem. Because the formulated SRM problems naturally constitute difference-convex-type programming problems, we solve them by employing a successive convex approximation method, where the nonconvex parts of each problem are approximated by their first-order Taylor expansion. Thus, the SRM problems can be iteratively solved through successive convex programming of their convexified versions. Results show that our algorithms can achieve a satisfactory solution with guaranteed convergence.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2477305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07270332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2477305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"6753","endPage":"6758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding and Artificial Noise Design for Cognitive MIMOME Wiretap Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precoding and Artificial Noise Design for Cognitive MIMOME Wiretap Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16209997","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7270332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201218 and 61201241"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012056"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding and Artificial Noise Design for Cognitive MIMOME Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-fang-2477305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064594S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7270332","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7270334,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7270334/hang-small.gif","p":["Jun Hang (S'12) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, China, in 2008 and 2011,\n respectively.

It may generate large electromagnetic torque ripple and serious mechanical vibration. Therefore, a rapid fault detection method is greatly required to identify this fault at early stage and prevent damage to the system. This paper develops a method of the open-phase fault detection and discrimination for the PMSM drive system based on the zero-sequence voltage components, in which the discrimination of the fault types, namely internal stator winding failure and switches failure of the inverter is realized. Then, appropriate fault-tolerant measures may be taken according to the different fault types. The experimental platform is established, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that not only the open-phase fault can be rapidly detected, but also the fault type can be effectively discriminated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7270334/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15754644","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection and Discrimination of Open-Phase Fault in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB035603"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51137001 and 51320105002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and Discrimination of Open-Phase Fault in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive System","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2479399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073676S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7270334","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7270335,"authors":[{"name":"Wanlu Sun","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7270335/sun-2479248-small.gif","p":["\n\nWanlu Sun received the B.E. degree in communication engineering and the \nM.E. degree in communication and information systems from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, \nBeijing, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, we investigate the radio resource management problem for D2D-based V2V communication. First, we analyze and transform the latency and reliability requirements of V2V communication into optimization constraints that are computable using only the slowly varying channel information. This transformation opens up the possibility of extending certain existing D2D techniques to cater to V2V communication. Second, we propose a problem formulation that fulfills the different requirements of V2V communication and traditional cellular communication. Moreover, a Separate resOurce bLock and powEr allocatioN (SOLEN) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Finally, simulations are presented to evaluate different schemes, which illustrate the necessity of careful design when extending D2D methods to V2V communication, as well as show promising performance of the proposed SOLEN algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","volume":"65","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16210032","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7270335/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radio Resource Management for D2D-Based V2V Communication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council","grantNumber":"2011-5824"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"FP7","grantNumber":"ICT-317669 METIS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Resource Management for D2D-Based V2V Communication","sourcePdf":"tvt-sun-2479248-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100008S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7270335","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7270337,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7270337/minli-2479226-small.gif","p":["Min Li (M\u201912) received the B.E. degree in telecommunications engineering, the M.E. degree in information and communication engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA, in 2006, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

In this paper, we study CS/CB with the aim of developing low-complexity multicell coordinated user scheduling policies. We focus on a class of multicell interfering broadcast networks in which base stations have only local data and local channel state information, but each has sufficient antennas to serve multiple users using zero-forcing beamforming. The coordination problem is formulated as finding scheduling decisions across the cells such that the network sum rate is maximized. Starting from the two-cell model, we uncover the structure for a good scheduling decision, which in turn leads to the definition of two distributed scheduling policies of differing complexity and intercell coordination. Asymptotic theoretical bounds on the average sum rate are derived to predict the performance of the policies proposed. We extend to some example networks containing more than two cells and develop network-wide coordination policies. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed policies and shed light on practical coordinated system design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15785909","htmlLink":"/document/7270337/","displayDocTitle":"Multicell Coordinated Scheduling With Multiuser Zero-Forcing Beamforming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE International Conference on Communications"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Information Theory Workshop"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001230","fundingName":"Macquarie University under the MQVCIF Fellowship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000943","fundingName":"CSIRO Macquarie University Chair in Wireless Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicell Coordinated Scheduling With Multiuser Zero-Forcing Beamforming","sourcePdf":"twc-li-2479226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121768S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7270337","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7270339,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Ibrahim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/7294742/7270339/ibrah-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Ibrahim (S\u201913) received the BSc (Hons.) degree in\n electrical engineering in 2010 and the MSc degree in 2013 both from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.

In particular, error recoverability is of key interest in medical applications due to the need for system reliability. Errors are likely during droplet manipulation due to defects, chip degradation, and the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments. We present an illustrative survey on recently proposed techniques for error recovery. The parameters of the error-recovery design space are shown and evaluated for these schemes. Next, we make use of these evaluations to describe how they can guide error recovery in DMFBs. By exploiting the flexibility provided by field-programmable biochip designs (FPBs), as in the case of their FPGA counterparts in electronic systems, we present a dynamic adaptation technique for error recovery in practical FPBs with a limited number of available control pins. Using two representative real-life bioassays, we show that the proposed approach can provide rapid error recovery for pin-constrained FPBs and it is more effective than recently published methods that target this problem.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/7294742/07270339.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2478457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2478457","startPage":"46","endPage":"58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Error Recovery in Cyberphysical Digital-Microfluidic Biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270339/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Error Recovery in Cyberphysical Digital-Microfluidic Biochips","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7270339/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"15552527","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1135853"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Error Recovery in Cyberphysical Digital-Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tmscs-ibrahim-2478457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116072S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7294742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7294742","articleId":"7270339","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7270340,"authors":[{"name":"Frederic Lehmann","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement Communications, Image et Traitement de I'Information (CITI), Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Telecom SudParis, \u00c9vry, France"],"bio":{"p":["Frederic Lehmann received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique et de Radio\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 de Grenoble, Grenoble, France, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Polytechnical Institute (INPG), Grenoble, in 2002.","From 1999 to 2002, he was a Research Engineer with STMicroelectronics.

Our primary focus is on orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM)-based amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relaying, where each source node suffers from reradiation of its own signal. An important issue is the superposition of the desired and interfering signals, which makes the channel estimation task difficult, particularly for varying channel coefficients. To address this challenging problem, we introduce a factor graph model of the estimation and detection problem at hand. Exploiting the conditional independence between unknown variables in the factor graph, an efficient message-passing algorithm, which performs joint Bayesian channel estimation, self-interference mitigation, and decoding, is derived. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method is close to that given by perfect knowledge of the channel for the target and interfering signals, even with limited training overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2479364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07270340.pdf","startPage":"6136","endPage":"6145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2479364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Message-Passing Receiver for OFDM-Based Self-Interference-Limited Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270340/","displayDocTitle":"A Message-Passing Receiver for OFDM-Based Self-Interference-Limited Networks","volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210028","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7270340/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Message-Passing Receiver for OFDM-Based Self-Interference-Limited Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-lehmann-2479364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083225S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7270340","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7270344,"authors":[{"name":"Bardia Bozorgzadeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7426429/7270344/7270344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bardia Bozorgzadeh (S\u201908\u2013M\u201915) was born in 1983.

Astrocytes are the largest cell population in the brain. With the discovery of calcium wave propagation through astrocyte networks, now it is more evident that neuronal networks alone may not explain functionality of the strongest natural computer, the brain. Models of cortical function must now account for astrocyte activities as well as their relationships with neurons in encoding and manipulation of sensory information. From an engineering viewpoint, astrocytes provide feedback to both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons to regulate their signaling behaviors. This paper presents a modified neural glial interaction model that allows a convenient digital implementation. This model can reproduce relevant biological astrocyte behaviors, which provide appropriate feedback control in regulating neuronal activities in the central nervous system (CNS). Accordingly, we investigate the feasibility of a digital implementation for a single astrocyte constructed by connecting a two coupled FitzHugh Nagumo (FHN) neuron model to an implementation of the proposed astrocyte model using neuron-astrocyte interactions. Hardware synthesis, physical implementation on FPGA, and theoretical analysis confirm that the proposed neuron astrocyte model, with significantly low hardware cost, can mimic biological behavior such as the regulation of postsynaptic neuron activity and the synaptic transmission mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2450837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7422857/07270348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2450837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422857","startPage":"518","endPage":"529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital Realization of Astrocyte and Neural Glial Interactions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Digital Realization of Astrocyte and Neural Glial Interactions","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270348/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15823089","pubMedId":"26390499","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7270348/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digital Realization of Astrocyte and Neural Glial Interactions","sourcePdf":"tbcas-hayati-2450837-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097114S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7422857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7422857","articleId":"7270348","onlineDate":"16 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7270350,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Zhu","affiliation":["Microsoft Corp., USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7287835/7270350/7270350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun Zhu received the M.S. and B.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Oklahoma State University.","She is currently a Data Scientist at Microsoft Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.

Based on data collected from wearable motion sensors and the associated locational context, this paper presents a coherent anomaly detection framework to effectively detect different behavioral anomalies in human daily life. Four types of anomalies, including spatial anomaly, timing anomaly, duration anomaly, and sequence anomaly, are detected using a probabilistic theoretical framework. This framework is based on complex activity recognition using dynamic Bayesian network modeling. The maximum-likelihood estimation algorithm and Laplace smoothing are used in learning the parameters in the anomaly detection model. We conducted experimental evaluation in a mock apartment environment, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The architecture provides improved out-of-band noise performance, thanks to an intrinsic low-pass noise filtering capability, reduced quantization noise scaled by capacitance ratios, and sinc 2 alias attenuation due to a quasi-linear reconstruction interpolation. With a respective unit and baseband capacitances of 2 fF and 45 pF, the architecture attains a potential 14 bit equivalent quantization noise with a 1024 unit capacitance array. Using four 10 bit charge-based DACs (QDACs) at 128 MS/s sampling rate, it achieves -155 dBc/Hz at 45 MHz offset from a 1 GHz modulated carrier. The incremental-charge-based operation also leads to an improved efficiency at back-off conditions. For an average output power of 1 dBm (20 MHz BW), total power consumption is 41.3 mW, of which only 0.5 mW corresponds to the system charge intake. The prototype is implemented using a 28 nm 0.9 V CMOS technology, with a core area of 0.25 mm 2 .

However, it also opens the possibility for attackers to eavesdrop the broadcast data or to pretend to be another node or device. These two attacks define the protection goals, namely, confidentiality and authenticity. Traditionally, both are solved by cryptographic approaches exploiting knowledge available in the surrounding infrastructure. The novel communication paradigms for the Internet of Things or cyber-physical systems do not scale with the standard cryptographic approach. Instead it is possible to exploit properties of the underlying physical channel to provide countermeasures against eavesdropping and impersonation attacks. Thereby, the random fading channel induces uncertainty which is detrimental but at the same time also helpful. In this paper, we review and describe a generalized model for physical-layer-based confidential data transmission and wireless authentication. A key role is played by the channel uncertainty and available design dimensions such as time, frequency, and space. We show that wireless authentication and secret-key generation can work in multicarrier and multiple-antenna systems and explain how even outdated channel state information can help to increase the available secure degrees of freedom. This survey focuses on the system design of wireless physical-layer confidentiality and authenticity under channel uncertainty. The insights could lead to a design of practical systems which are preparing the ground for confidentiality and authenticity already on the physical layer of the communication protocol stack.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcasting Into the Uncertainty: Authentication and Confidentiality by Physical-Layer Processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2469602","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7270357/07270404.pdf","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2469602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270357","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270404","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Broadcasting Into the Uncertainty: Authentication and Confidentiality by Physical-Layer Processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"103","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7270404/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456811","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)"},{"fundingName":"Federal Ministry of Education"},{"fundingName":"Research of the Federal Republic of Germany (Fr\u00f6derkennzeichen 16 KIS0009, Prophylaxe)"},{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR)","grantNumber":"RBFR105NLC"},{"fundingName":"DFG, Germany","grantNumber":"SE 1697/11"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcasting Into the Uncertainty: Authentication and Confidentiality by Physical-Layer Processing","sourcePdf":"jproc-jorswieck-2469602-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.244122S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7270357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7270357","articleId":"7270404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7270408,"authors":[{"name":"Aylin Yener","affiliation":["Wireless Communications and Networking Laboratory (WCAN), Electrical Engineering Department, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7270357/7270408/yener-2459592-small.gif","p":["\nAylin Yener (Fellow, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering, and the B.Sc. degree in physics, from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB), Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.","She has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA, since 2010, where she joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor in 2002.

Lower emission, convenient charging experience, high performance, and energy security are considered as the significant benefits of the mentioned technology. Despite the aforementioned advantages, inappropriate place and size of CSs have brought new challenges for electric distribution systems. Prominent features of distributed generations (DGs) make this technology appropriate for compensating relevant problems of CSs installation. In this paper, simultaneous optimal planning (placing and sizing) of CSs and DGs is presented to address new challenges. In addition, financial (investment costs), technical (system reliability, power loss, and voltage profile), and environmental (CO2 emission) issues are considered in the proposed objective function. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the simulation study is carried out on a 33-bus radial distribution network. The simulation results show the effects of installation of CSs in the presence/absence of DGs on total costs, reliability, loss, voltage profile, and emission. Moreover, the effects of increasing PEV's availability are evaluated on the aforementioned terms in the electric distribution network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230329","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/7230329/07270415.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2015.2436811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2015.2436811","startPage":"238","endPage":"245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Planning of PEV Charging Stations and DGs Considering Financial, Technical,and Environmental Effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270415/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Planning of PEV Charging Stations and DGs Considering Financial, Technical,and Environmental Effects","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7270415/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"15451769","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","publicationDate":"Summer 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Planning of PEV Charging Stations and DGs Considering Financial, Technical,and Environmental Effects","sourcePdf":"cjece-ardalan-2436811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098922S","chronDate":"Summer  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"7230329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7230329","articleId":"7270415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7270417,"authors":[{"name":"Marzyeh Ghassemi","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Marzyeh","lastName":"Ghassemi","id":"37085741117"},{"name":"Jarrad H.

This could bring cognitive brain computer interfaces (BCIs) that are driven by direct readout of mental images within reach. A desirable feature of such BCIs is that subjects gain the ability to construct arbitrary messages. In this study, we explore whether words can be generated from neural activity patterns that reflect the perception of individual characters. To this end, we developed a graphical model where low-level properties of individual characters are represented via Gaussian mixture models and high-level properties reflecting character co-occurrences are represented via a hidden Markov model. With this work we provide the initial outline of a model that could allow the development of cognitive BCIs driven by direct decoding of internally generated messages.","doi":"10.1109/PRNI.2015.31","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/7262674/7270822/07270855.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRNI.2015.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov Models for Reading Words from the Human Brain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270855/","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov Models for Reading Words from the Human Brain","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15473323","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7270855/","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov Models for Reading Words from the Human Brain","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"7145a089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073309S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7262674","isNumber":"7270822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7262674","xplore-issue":"7270822","articleId":"7270855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7270978,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin S.

In this paper, we propose a novel coupled autoassociative neural network for learning a target-to-source image representation for heterogenous face recognition. This coupled network is unique, because a cross-modal transformation is learned by forcing the hidden units (latent features) of two neural networks to be as similar as possible, while simultaneously preserving information from the input. The effectiveness of this model is demonstrated using multiple existing heterogeneous face recognition databases. Moreover, the empirical results show that the learned image representation-common latent features-by the coupled auto-associative produces competitive cross-modal face recognition results. These results are obtained by training a softmax classifier using only the latent features from the source domain and testing using only the latent features from the target domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","volume":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15478868","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2015","htmlLink":"/document/7270978/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coupled Auto-Associative Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Face Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished through the Cooperative Agreement","grantNumber":"W911NF-12-2-0019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Coupled Auto-Associative Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"access-riggan-2479620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086513S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7270978","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7270980,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Usman","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Via Sommarive 9, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7270980/usman-2479855-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Usman received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from the National University of Science and Technology, Pakistan, in 2008, the M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Trento, Italy, and the M.S. degree in computer networks from the Sant\u0160Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy, in 2013.

The proposed MOP is modeled such that the network providers can dynamically tune the tradeoff parameters to switch between different communication scenarios with diverse design requirements. In order to find its Pareto optimal solution, the MOP is transformed, using a weighted sum method, into a single-objective optimization problem (SOP), which itself can further be transformed from a fractional form, by exploiting fractional programming, into a subtractive form. Since the formulated SOP is hard to solve due to the combinatorial channel allocation indicators, we reformulate the SOP into a better tractable problem by relaxing the combinatorial indicators using the idea of time-sharing. We then prove that this reformulated SOP is strictly quasi-concave with respect to the transmission power and the subcarrier allocation indicator. We then propose an iterative two-layer distributed framework to achieve an upper bound Pareto optimal solution of the original proposed MOP. The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed two-layer framework achieving an upper bound Pareto optimal solution, which is very close to an optimal solution, with fast convergence, lower and acceptable polynomial complexity, and balanced EE-SE tradeoff.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2479406","startPage":"1655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07270991.pdf","endPage":"1671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2479406","topic":"Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270991/","displayDocTitle":"Energy and Spectrum Efficient Transmission Techniques Under QoS Constraints Toward Green Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7270991/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15494231","publicationDate":"2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K011693/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European FP7 Programme","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-610524"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy and Spectrum Efficient Transmission Techniques Under QoS Constraints Toward Green Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"access-pervaiz-2479406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132172S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks"],"articleId":"7270991","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7270998,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Hormigo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Universidad de Malaga, Malaga, E-29071 Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7486166/7270998/hormi-2479623-small.gif","p":["Javier Hormigo received the MSc and PhD degrees, both in\n telecommunication engineering, from the Universidad de Malaga, Spain, in 1996 and 2000, respectively.

They are based on shifting the set of exactly represented numbers which are used in conventional radix- \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\beta$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n number systems. This technique allows performing radix complement and round to nearest without carry propagation with negligible time and hardware cost. Furthermore, the proposed formats have the same storage cost and precision as standard ones. Since conversion to conventional formats simply require appending one extra-digit to the operands, standard circuits may be used to perform arithmetic operations with operands under the new format. We also extend the features of the RN-representation system and carry out a thorough comparison between both representation systems. We conclude that the proposed representation system is generally more adequate to implement systems for computation with real number under round-to-nearest.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2479623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7486166/07270998.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2479623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7486166","startPage":"2158","endPage":"2168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Formats for Computing with Real-Numbers under Round-to-Nearest","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7270998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Formats for Computing with Real-Numbers under Round-to-Nearest","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7270998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7270998/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education and Science of Spain","grantNumber":"TIN2013-42253-P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Formats for Computing with Real-Numbers under Round-to-Nearest","sourcePdf":"tc-hormigo-2479623-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09824S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7486166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7486166","articleId":"7270998","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7271003,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["Communications Research Centre Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7337347/7271003/zhang-2470103-small.gif","p":["Liang Zhang (M\u201911\u2013SM\u201914) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, in 1996, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.

The core of LDM is to transmit multiple-layer signals, where each layer occupies the whole channel bandwidth and the whole time. To meet the different requirements on different layers, each layer is allocated a specific power level, and is configured to use a different channel coding and modulation scheme, as well as its own multiple-antenna technology. Delivering robust and high-quality mobile TV services is one of the top priorities for the next generation digital TV (NG-DTV) systems. In this paper, we first investigate the performance of the NG-DTV systems with LDM in various difficult propagation channels that are likely encountered by the large variety of mobile devices, including fast-fading channels, slow-fading channels, indoor channels, and single-frequency-network (SFN) channels. A new channel estimation technique is proposed to overcome the severe performance degradation caused by the SFN channels. We will further show that using LDM makes it possible to deliver mobile services using the efficient 32k transmission mode. Finally, receive antenna diversity is shown to provide different levels of performance improvement for different LDM configurations.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2470103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2470103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7337347/07271003.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Characterization and Optimization of Mobile Service Delivery in LDM-Based Next Generation DTV Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Characterization and Optimization of Mobile Service Delivery in LDM-Based Next Generation DTV Systems","volume":"61","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271003/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15660697","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271003/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Characterization and Optimization of Mobile Service Delivery in LDM-Based Next Generation DTV Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-zhang-2470103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071641S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7337347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7337347","articleId":"7271003","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7271004,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279307300"},{"name":"Chunxing Ni","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chunxing","lastName":"Ni","id":"38563644100"},{"name":"Chen Ye","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Wuhan Zhongyuan Electronic Information Corporation, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Ye","id":"37085727843"},{"name":"Yiting Wu","affiliation":["School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yiting","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085734076"},{"name":"Kai Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085617620"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"7271004","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":854},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Bit error rate","Computational complexity","Least squares methods","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","clipping control tone reservation scheme","computational complexity","weighted least square algorithm","peak-canceling signal","clipping noise","data block","MB-TR scheme","peak-to-average power ratio","OQAM-OFDM system","PAPR reduction method","multiblock tone reservation scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Offset quadrature amplitude modulation-based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OQAM-OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio","multi-block tone reservation","weighted least square"]},{"kwd":["Offset quadrature amplitude modulation-based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OQAM-OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio","multi-block tone reservation","weighted least square"]}],"abstract":"Due to the overlapping structure of the offset quadrature amplitude modulation-based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OQAM-OFDM) signals, the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in OQAM-OFDM systems cannot be efficiently reduced by existing PAPR reduction methods, which independently consider the PAPR reduction in each data block. In this paper, a novel multiblock tone reservation (MB-TR ) scheme is proposed for the PAPR reduction in OQAM-OFDM systems. The key idea of the MB-TR scheme is to exploit the overlapping structure of the OQAM-OFDM signals and jointly consider the adjacent data blocks to obtain the clipping noise. To effectively eliminate the peaks of the OQAM-OFDM signals, the MB-TR scheme generates the peak-canceling signal by employing the weighted least square algorithm to fit the waveform of the peak-canceling signal to the waveform of clipping noise. Simulation results and analysis show that the MB-TR scheme could offer better PAPR reduction with lower computational complexity than the clipping control tone reservation scheme directly employed in OQAM-OFDM systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Multi-Block Tone Reservation Scheme for PAPR Reduction in OQAM-OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2465146","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7337347/07271004.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2465146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Multi-Block Tone Reservation Scheme for PAPR Reduction in OQAM-OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7271004/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15660699","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172052 and 61271228"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Development 863 Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A710"},{"fundingName":"Key Program Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of Hubei, China","grantNumber":"2013CFA055"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Multi-Block Tone Reservation Scheme for PAPR Reduction in OQAM-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-jiang-2465146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084539S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7337347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7337347","articleId":"7271004","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7271008,"authors":[{"name":"Shaohua Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, P.R.

This paper presents a hierarchical key assignment scheme based on linear-geometry as the solution of flexible and fine-grained hierarchical access control in cloud computing. In our scheme, the encryption key of each class in the hierarchy is associated with a private vector and a public vector, and the inner product of the private vector of an ancestor class and the public vector of its descendant class can be used to derive the encryption key of that descendant class. The proposed scheme belongs to direct access schemes on hierarchical access control, namely each class at a higher level in the hierarchy can directly derive the encryption key of its descendant class without the need of iterative computation. In addition to this basic hierarchical key derivation, we also give a dynamic key management mechanism to efficiently address potential changes in the hierarchy. Our scheme only needs light computations over finite field and provides strong key indistinguishability under the assumption of pseudorandom functions. Furthermore, the simulation shows that our scheme has an optimized trade-off between computation consumption and storage space.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16054873","htmlLink":"/document/7271008/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Achieving Simple, Secure and Efficient Hierarchical Access Control in Cloud Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2014CB360501"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1135004 and 61170080"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030308006"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"U1405255 and 61472083"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61202466"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Simple, Secure and Efficient Hierarchical Access Control in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tc-huang-2479609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135044S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7486166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7486166","articleId":"7271008","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7271011,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiota Papavramidou","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Felix Viallet, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7486166/7271011/papav-2479618-small.gif","p":["Panagiota Papavramidou received the master's degree in\n electronics from the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, Greece, and the PhD degree in nanoelectronics and\n nanotechnologies from the Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble, France.

They should also be repaired after fabrication to achieve acceptable fabrication yield. In technologies affected by high defect densities, conventional repair induces very high costs. To reduce it, we can use ECC-based repair, consisting in using the ECC for fixing words comprising a single faulty cell and self-repair to fix all other faulty words. However, as we show in this paper, for high defect densities the diagnosis circuitry required for ECC-based repair may induce very large hardware cost. To fix this issue, we introduce a new family of memory test algorithms that exhibit a property we termed as \u201csingle-read double-fault detection\u201d. This approach gains interest in ultimate CMOS and post-CMOS technologies, where the defect densities are expected to increase significantly, and/or in very-low power design, as very-low voltage sharply increases defect densities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16054862","htmlLink":"/document/7271011/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Test Algorithms for ECC-Based Memory Repair in Ultimate CMOS and Post-CMOS","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CATRENE project TOETS","grantNumber":"CT 302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test Algorithms for ECC-Based Memory Repair in Ultimate CMOS and Post-CMOS","sourcePdf":"tc-nicolaidis-2479618-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099072S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7486166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7486166","articleId":"7271011","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7271019,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Marquardt","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7243388/7271019/7271019-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Marquardt (S\u201912) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in media technology with a focus on Audio-Visual Technology from Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany, in 2010.

For the desired speech source and the interfering sources, e.g., competing speakers, this can be achieved by preserving their relative transfer functions (RTFs). It has been shown that the binaural multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) preserves the RTF of the desired speech source, but typically distorts the RTF of the interfering sources. To this end, in this paper we propose two extensions of the binaural MWF, i.e., the binaural MWF with RTF preservation (MWF-RTF) aiming to preserve the RTF of the interfering source and the binaural MWF with interference rejection (MWF-IR) aiming to completely suppress the interfering source. Analytical expressions for the performance of the binaural MWF, MWF-RTF and MWF-IR in terms of noise reduction, speech distortion and binaural cue preservation are derived, showing that the proposed extensions yield a better performance in terms of the signal-to-interference ratio and preservation of the binaural cues of the directional interference, while the overall noise reduction performance is degraded compared to the binaural MWF. Simulation results using binaural behind-the-ear impulse responses measured in a reverberant environment validate the derived analytical expressions for the theoretically achievable performance of the binaural MWF, MWF-RTF, and MWF-IR, showing that the performance highly depends on the position of the interfering source and the number of microphones. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the MWF-RTF yields a very similar overall noise reduction performance as the binaural MWF, while preserving the binaural cues of both the speech and the interfering source.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15484282","htmlLink":"/document/7271019/","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical Analysis of Linearly Constrained Multi-Channel Wiener Filtering Algorithms for Combined Noise Reduction and Binaural Cue Preservation in Binaural Hearing Aids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical Analysis of Linearly Constrained Multi-Channel Wiener Filtering Algorithms for Combined Noise Reduction and Binaural Cue Preservation in Binaural Hearing Aids","sourcePdf":"taslp-marquardt-2479940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096254S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7243388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7243388","articleId":"7271019","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7271024,"authors":[{"name":"Chanying Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/7499900/7271024/li-2479879-small.gif","p":["\n\nChanying Li received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Sichuan \nUniversity, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control theory from the Academy of \nMathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","She was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, from 2008 to 2009, and the University of Hong \nKong from 2009 to 2011.

Such standards also include hierarchical modulation as a mean to provide unequal error protection in highly variable channels over satellite. Foreseeing the increasing need for higher data rates, this paper tackles the optimization of 64-APSK constellations to minimize the mean square error between the original and received symbol. Optimization is performed according to the sensitivity of the data to the channel errors, by means of genetic algorithms, a well-known technique currently used in a variety of application domains, when close form solutions are impractical. Test results show that through non-uniform constellation and asymmetric symbol mapping, it is possible to significantly reduce the distortion while preserving bandwidth efficiency. Tests performed on real signals based on perceptual quality measurements allow validating the proposed scheme against conventional 64-APSK constellations and CCSDS mapping.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2470134","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7423828/07271031.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2470134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7423828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"64-APSK Constellation and Mapping Optimization for Satellite Broadcasting Using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Satellite broadcasting","Modulation","Nonlinear distortion","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","digital video broadcasting","direct broadcasting by satellite","genetic algorithms","least mean squares methods","phase shift keying","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["64-APSK constellation","mapping optimization","genetic algorithms","DVB-S2 satellite broadcasting standard","DVB-SH satellite broadcasting standard","CCSDS mapping","unequal error protection","mean square error","channel errors","asymmetric symbol mapping","perceptual quality measurements","amplitude phase shift keying modulation","Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","amplitude phase shift keying (APSK)","consultative committee for space data systems (CCSDS)","unequal error protection","genetic optimization"]},{"kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","amplitude phase shift keying (APSK)","consultative committee for space data systems (CCSDS)","unequal error protection","genetic optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"64-APSK Constellation and Mapping Optimization for Satellite Broadcasting Using Genetic Algorithms","volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7271031/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15835624","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"64-APSK Constellation and Mapping Optimization for Satellite Broadcasting Using Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tbc-murroni-2470134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079504S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7423828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7423828","articleId":"7271031","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7271032,"authors":[{"name":"Rakan Maddah","affiliation":["Non-Volatile Solutions Group, Intel Corporation"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7486166/7271032/madda-2479593-small.gif","p":["Rakan Maddah received the BS and MS degree in computer science from\n the Lebanese American University in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the PhD degree from the Computer Science\n Department at the University of Pittsburgh in 2015.

While PCM has desirable properties in terms of scalability and density, it suffers from limited endurance. Repeated writes cause PCM cells to wear out and get permanently stuck at a specific value. Recovering from stuck-at faults through a proactive error correcting scheme is essential for the widespread adoption of PCM. In this paper, we propose Symbol Shifting as a practical technique to increase the number of faults that an error correcting code can cover in single and multilevel cells memory chips. Since stuck-at cells can still be read, errors are manifested only when a worn-out cell is to be programmed with a symbol value different than the value it is stuck at. After a write operation fails for a given block of data, another write operation is attempted with all original data symbols shifted to another memory level. Shifting the data is likely to bring the number of errors within the nominal capability of the deployed error correcting code. Requiring only one additional auxiliary cell, Symbol Shifting can increase the number of faults that an error correcting code can cover by up to double the nominal capability and extends the lifetime by up to 37 percent.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271032","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Error correction codes","Resistance","Random access

multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system with dual polarization and band-rejection capabilities is proposed. The proposed MIMO antenna system consists of two quasi-self-complementary (QSC) antenna elements. The elements are arranged orthogonally and fed perpendicularly to obtain polarization diversity. High isolation can be achieved without additional decoupling structure owing to the inherent advantage of the self-complementary structure. Notched band at WLAN system can be realized by etching a bent slit in each of the radiating elements. Moreover, a four-element MIMO system is also proposed and investigated to fully reveal its potential use. Diversity performance in terms of envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) and the mean effective gain (MEG) ratio are studied. Measured results show that the proposed antenna has a wide bandwidth ranging from 3 to 12 GHz with band rejection at WLAN system and high port isolation (S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">12</sub>\n \u2264 -20 dB at most of the band), which demonstrate the proposed MIMO/diversity antenna system can be a good candidate for UWB applications.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2479622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07271035.pdf","startPage":"905","endPage":"908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2479622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Dual-Polarized UWB Quasi-Self-Complementary MIMO/Diversity Antenna With Band-Rejection Capability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271035/","displayDocTitle":"Compact Dual-Polarized UWB Quasi-Self-Complementary MIMO/Diversity Antenna With Band-Rejection Capability","volume":"15","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"15868851","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271035/","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61139001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Dual-Polarized UWB Quasi-Self-Complementary MIMO/Diversity Antenna With Band-Rejection Capability","sourcePdf":"lawp-zhu-2479622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078849S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7271035","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7271043,"authors":[{"name":"Wongyu Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7486166/7271043/shin-2479587-small.gif","p":["Wongyu Shin received the BS degree in electrical and electronics\n engineering from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea in 2011, and the MS degree in electrical engineering from the\n Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2013, where he is currently working\n toward the PhD degree.

Memory controllers cannot distinguish between them since they are performed consecutively by a single row-activation command. If these two steps are separated, the restoring can be delayed until DRAM access is uncongested. Hence, we propose Quick-Access DRAM (Q-DRAM) which discriminates between sensing and restoring. Our approach is to allow destructive access (i.e., only sensing is performed without restoring by a row-activation command) using per-bank multiple row-buffers. We call the destructive access and per-bank multiple row-buffers quick-access and quick-buffers (q-buffers) respectively. In addition, we propose Quick-access Trigger (Q-TRIGGER) and RESTORER to utilize Q-DRAM. Q-TRIGGER makes a decision whether quick-access is required or not, and RESTORER decides when to restore the data at the destructed cell. Specifically, RESTORER detects the proper timing to hide restoring time by predicting data bus occupation and by exploiting bank-level locality. Evaluations show that Q-DRAM significantly improved performance for both single- and multi-core systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271043/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","volume":"65","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16054870","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","publicationDate":"1 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7271043/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Q-DRAM: Quick-Access DRAM with Decoupled Restoring from Row-Activation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001039","fundingName":"NRF"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A2A1A05004316"},{"fundingName":"SK hynix"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003836","fundingName":"IDEC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Q-DRAM: Quick-Access DRAM with Decoupled Restoring from Row-Activation","sourcePdf":"tc-shin-2479587-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107767S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7486166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7486166","articleId":"7271043","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7271045,"authors":[{"name":"Yahong Han","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7271045/han-2479917-small.gif","p":["Yahong Han received the Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

However, each kind of descriptors describes the local characteristics around the reference point only from one cue. To enhance the descriptive and discriminative ability from multiple cues, this paper proposes a descriptor learning framework to optimize the descriptors at the source by learning a projection from multiple descriptors' spaces to a new Euclidean space. In this space, multiple cues and characteristics of different descriptors are fused and complemented for each other. In order to make the new descriptor more discriminative, we learn the multi-cue projection by the minimization of the ratio of within-class scatter to between-class scatter, and therefore, the discriminative ability of the projected descriptor is enhanced. In the experiment, we evaluate our framework on the tasks of action recognition from still images and videos. Experimental results on two benchmark image and two benchmark video data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and better performance of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271045/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15484412","pubMedId":"26394424","volume":"24","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compact and Discriminative Descriptor Inference Using Multi-Cues","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2015CB352302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61202166 and 61472276"},{"fundingName":"D2DCRC"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0764"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61472116"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact and Discriminative Descriptor Inference Using Multi-Cues","sourcePdf":"tip-han-2479917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08763S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7271045","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7271052,"authors":[{"name":"Quanxue Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7271052/qgao-2479559-small.gif","p":["Quanxue Gao received the B.Eng. degree from Xi\u2019an Highway University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1998, the M.S. degree from the Gansu University of Technology, Lanzhou, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, in 2005.

This paper aims to seek a projection matrix such that the low-dimensional representations well characterize the discriminant structure embedded in high-dimensional data and simultaneously well fit sparse representation-based classifier (SRC). To be specific, Fisher discriminant criterion (FDC) is used to extract the discriminant structure, and sparse representation is simultaneously considered to guarantee that the projected data well satisfy the SRC. Thus, our method, called SRC-FDC, characterizes both the spatial Euclidean distribution and local reconstruction relationship, which enable SRC to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments are done on the AR, CMU-PIE, Extended Yale B face image databases, the USPS digit database, and COIL20 database, and results illustrate that the proposed method is more efficient than other feature extraction methods based on SRC.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2479559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07271052.pdf","startPage":"5684","endPage":"5695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2479559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction by Integrating Sparse Representation and Fisher Criterion and its Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction by Integrating Sparse Representation and Fisher Criterion and its Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"24","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271052/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15551293","pubMedId":"26394421","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271296 and 61125204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2012M521747"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"BDY21"},{"fundingName":"Open Project Program through the State Key Laboratory of Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics, Zhejiang University","grantNumber":"A1407"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimensionality Reduction by Integrating Sparse Representation and Fisher Criterion and its Applications","sourcePdf":"tip-gao-2479559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140822S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7271052","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7271058,"authors":[{"name":"Yangbing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7486166/7271058/wu-2479614-small.gif","p":["Yangbing Wu received the BS degree from the China University of\n Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2008.

This observation recently leads to hybridizing PSO with GA for performance enhancement. However, existing work uses a mechanistic parallel superposition and research has shown that construction of superior exemplars in PSO is more effective. Hence, this paper first develops a new framework so as to organically hybridize PSO with another optimization technique for \u201clearning.\u201d This leads to a generalized \u201clearning PSO\u201d paradigm, the *L-PSO. The paradigm is composed of two cascading layers, the first for exemplar generation and the second for particle updates as per a normal PSO algorithm. Using genetic evolution to breed promising exemplars for PSO, a specific novel *L-PSO algorithm is proposed in the paper, termed genetic learning PSO (GL-PSO). In particular, genetic operators are used to generate exemplars from which particles learn and, in turn, historical search information of particles provides guidance to the evolution of the exemplars. By performing crossover, mutation, and selection on the historical information of particles, the constructed exemplars are not only well diversified, but also high qualified. Under such guidance, the global search ability and search efficiency of PSO are both enhanced. The proposed GL-PSO is tested on 42 benchmark functions widely adopted in the literature. Experimental results verify the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and scalability of the GL-PSO.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2475174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7567607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2475174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7567607/07271066.pdf","startPage":"2277","endPage":"2290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Learning Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Learning Particle Swarm Optimization","volume":"46","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271066/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16302742","pubMedId":"26394440","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271066/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013AA01A212"},{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61125205"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61332002 and 61502542"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Genetic Learning Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zhang-2475174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217833S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7567607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"7567607","articleId":"7271066","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7271067,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Wen Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7271067/cheng-2479561-small.gif","p":["Kai-Wen Cheng received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees with the Multimedia Network Laboratory in Electronic and Computer Engineering.

While most research on anomaly detection has focused more on detecting local anomalies, we are more interested in global anomalies that involve multiple normal events interacting in an unusual manner, such as car accidents. To simultaneously detect local and global anomalies, we cast the extraction of normal interactions from the training videos as a problem of finding the frequent geometric relations of the nearby sparse spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs). A codebook of interaction templates is then constructed and modeled using the GPR, based on which a novel inference method for computing the likelihood of an observed interaction is also developed. Thereafter, these local likelihood scores are integrated into globally consistent anomaly masks, from which anomalies can be succinctly identified. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time GPR is employed to model the relationship of the nearby STIPs for anomaly detection. Simulations based on four widespread datasets show that the new method outperforms the main state-of-the-art methods with lower computational burden.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07271067.pdf","startPage":"5288","endPage":"5301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2479561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2479561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Process Regression-Based Video Anomaly Detection and Localization With Hierarchical Feature Representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Hidden Markov models","Three-dimensional displays","Training","Feature extraction","Detectors","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","regression analysis","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian process regression","video anomaly detection","video anomaly localization","hierarchical feature representation","global anomalies","local anomalies","GPR","noisy training data","sparse features","sparse spatio-temporal interest points","STIP","local likelihood scores"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video surveillance","anomaly detection","global anomaly","Gaussian process regression"]},{"kwd":["Video surveillance","anomaly detection","global anomaly","Gaussian process regression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian Process Regression-Based Video Anomaly Detection and Localization With Hierarchical Feature Representation","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7271067/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15499166","pubMedId":"26394423","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 104-2221-E-011-048 and MOST 104-2221-E-011-112"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian Process Regression-Based Video Anomaly Detection and Localization With Hierarchical Feature Representation","sourcePdf":"tip-cheng-2479561-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14159S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7271067","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":7271071,"authors":[{"name":"Yiorgos Sfikas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina, PO Box 1186, 45110, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Sfikas","id":"37320311000"},{"name":"Yiorgos Tsiatouhas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina, PO Box 1186, 45110, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Tsiatouhas","id":"37085648874"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"7271071","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":382},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271071","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Leakage currents","Couplings","Circuit faults","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled circuits","DRAM chips","fault diagnosis","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neighbouring cell leakage testing","transition induced faults","DRAM","memory testing","leakage currents","cell state transitions","coupling fault model","CF model","neighborhood pattern sensitive fault","NPSF","neighborhood leakage and transition fault","NLTF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM testing","Neighborhood Leakage Transition Fault (NLTF) model","Test algorithm"]},{"kwd":["DRAM testing","neighborhood leakage transition fault (NLTF) model","test algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Due to their high density, modern DRAMs are very susceptible to the interactions between adjacent cells, which in turn increases the difficulty and complexity of memory testing. In this work, we studied the interaction mechanisms among neighbouring DRAM cells in order to provide an efficient testing solution. According to the open literature, there are two mechanisms responsible for this interaction: leakage currents and cell state transitions. The frequently used Coupling Fault (CF) model is inadequate to model the combined effect of these mechanisms, while testing procedures using the Neighborhood Pattern Sensitive Fault (NPSF) model are not time efficient solutions. Towards this direction, we propose a new fault model, the Neighborhood Leakage and Transition Fault (NLTF) model for DRAMs, which effectively models the faulty behavior related to neighbouring cell interference. In addition, we developed a new test algorithm which is based on the NLTF model, and provides test application time reductions ranging from 68 to 87 percent with respect to the existing testing algorithms in the literature that are capable to cover the NLTFs. Finally, the proposed algorithm is extended to cover NLTFs in word-oriented DRAMs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2479606","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2479606","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7486166/07271071.pdf","startPage":"2339","endPage":"2345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7486166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing Neighbouring Cell Leakage and Transition Induced Faults in DRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Testing Neighbouring Cell Leakage and Transition Induced Faults in DRAMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16054876","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7271071/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing Neighbouring Cell Leakage and Transition Induced Faults in DRAMs","sourcePdf":"tc-tsiatouhas-2479606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054177S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7486166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","xplore-issue":"7486166","articleId":"7271071","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7271084,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7271084/hang-small.gif","p":["Jun Hang (S'12) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, China, in 2008 and 2011,\n respectively.

The fault indicator and angle differences are defined for fault diagnosis. To implement online diagnosis, an effective frequency tracking algorithm is applied. Finally, the fault diagnosis steps are presented. This method is capable of detecting the fault, evaluating the fault severity, and identifying the faulty phases. The simulation and experiment are carried out to verify the proposed method.

Most existing research has predominantly focused on the learning of a universal aesthetic model based on hand-crafted visual descriptors . However, this research paradigm can achieve only limited success because (1) such hand-crafted descriptors cannot well preserve abstract aesthetic properties , and (2) such a universal model cannot always capture the full diversity of visual content. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a novel query-dependent aesthetic model with deep learning for photo quality assessment. In our method, deep aesthetic abstractions are discovered from massive images , whereas the aesthetic assessment model is learned in a query- dependent manner. Our work addresses the first problem by learning mid-level aesthetic feature abstractions via powerful deep convolutional neural networks to automatically capture the underlying aesthetic characteristics of the massive training images . Regarding the second problem, because photographers tend to employ different rules of photography for capturing different images , the aesthetic model should also be query- dependent . Specifically, given an image to be assessed, we first identify which aesthetic model should be applied for this particular image. Then, we build a unique aesthetic model of this type to assess its aesthetic quality. We conducted extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets and demonstrated that the proposed query-dependent model equipped with learned deep aesthetic abstractions significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hand-crafted feature -based and universal model-based methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271097/","volume":"17","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7271097/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15553468","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Query-Dependent Aesthetic Model With Deep Learning for Photo Quality Assessment","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 project","grantNumber":"2015CB351803"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61390514 and 61201413"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"WK2100060011, WK2100100021 and 61301082"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"WJ2100060003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Query-Dependent Aesthetic Model With Deep Learning for Photo Quality Assessment","sourcePdf":"tmm-tian-2479916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087062S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7271097","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7271098,"authors":[{"name":"Toni Ernvall","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland","Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Toni Ernvall received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Turku, Finland, in 2011 and 2015, respectively, in mathematics.","Since March 2015, he has been with the Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis at Aalto University, Finland.

If a joint maximum-likelihood decoding is to be performed at the receiver, then every MIMO-MAC code can be regarded as a single-user code, where the minimum determinant criterion proposed by Tarokh et al. is useful for designing such codes and for upper bounding the maximum pairwise error probability (PEP), whenever the codes are of finite rate and operate in finite signal-to-noise ratio range. Unlike the case of single-user codes where the minimum determinant can be lower bounded by a fixed constant as code-rate grows, it was proved by Lahtonen et al. that the minimum determinant of MIMO-MAC codes decays as a function of the rates. This decay phenomenon is further investigated in this paper, and upper bounds for the decays of minimum determinant corresponding to each error event are provided. Lower bounds for the optimal decay are established and are based on an explicit construction of codes using algebraic number theory and Diophantine approximation. For some error profiles, the constructed codes are shown to meet the aforementioned upper bounds, hence they are optimal finite-rate codes in terms of PEPs associated with such error events. An asymptotic diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) analysis of the proposed codes is also given. It is shown that these codes are DMT optimal when the values of multiplexing gains are small.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2479638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07271098.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2479638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","startPage":"5931","endPage":"5947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Error Event Sensitive Tradeoff Between Rate and Coding Gain in MIMO MAC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Error Event Sensitive Tradeoff Between Rate and Coding Gain in MIMO MAC","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524614","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7271098/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005877","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"276031, 282938, 283262 and 252457"},{"fundingName":"Finnish Cultural Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MOST 101-2923-E-009-001-MY3 and MOST 103-2221-E-009-043-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Error Event Sensitive Tradeoff Between Rate and Coding Gain in MIMO MAC","sourcePdf":"tit-ernvall-2479638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157905S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7271098","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7271101,"authors":[{"name":"Xinping Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Xinping Yi (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.E. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2005, and the M.E. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2009, both in Electrical Engineering.

We show that the topological information can also be exploited in this case to strictly improve the degrees of freedom (DoF) as long as the network is not fully connected, which is a reasonable assumption in practice. Achievability schemes from graph theoretic and interference alignment perspectives are proposed. Together with outer bounds built upon generator sequence, the concept of compound channel settings, and the relation to index coding, we characterize the symmetric DoF for the so-called regular networks with constant number of interfering links, and identify the sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the arbitrary network topologies to achieve a certain amount of symmetric DoF.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2479857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07271101.pdf","startPage":"6107","endPage":"6130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2479857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topological Interference Management With Transmitter Cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271101/","displayDocTitle":"Topological Interference Management With Transmitter Cooperation","volume":"61","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15538811","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271101/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"framework of Celtic-Plus SHARING Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topological Interference Management With Transmitter Cooperation","sourcePdf":"tit-yi-2479857-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128718S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7271101","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7271103,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh R.

Information extracted from multiple sensors of the sEMG recording sites can be used as inputs to control powered upper limb prostheses. However, usage of multiple EMG sensors on the prosthetic hand is not practical and makes it difficult for amputees due to electrode shift/movement, and often amputees feel discomfort in wearing sEMG sensor array. Instead, using fewer numbers of sensors would greatly improve the controllability of prosthetic devices and it would add dexterity and flexibility in their operation. In this paper, we propose a novel myoelectric control technique for identification of various gestures using the minimum number of sensors based on independent component analysis (ICA) and Icasso clustering. The proposed method is a model-based approach where a combination of source separation and Icasso clustering was utilized to improve the classification performance of independent finger movements for transradial amputee subjects. Two sEMG sensor combinations were investigated based on the muscle morphology and Icasso clustering and compared to Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) and greedy search algorithm. The performance of the proposed method has been validated with five transradial amputees, which reports a higher classification accuracy ( >95%). The outcome of this study encourages possible extension of the proposed approach to real time prosthetic applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Electromyography","Feature

While the structure of a multichannel equalizer and least-squares-based adaptation algorithm are extensively used in practice, little is known in how to choose the number of sensors, separation between them, and lengths of the constituent filters such that the equalization performance is optimized. This paper studies the problem of optimal multichannel equalizer design in the context of time-varying underwater acoustic communication channels. In the first part, the paper presents a theoretical characterization of the equalization performance when the number of symbols that can be received in the time period over which the channel can be considered time invariant is limited. This result is then used to develop an understanding that the optimal number of equalizer coefficients is a tradeoff between the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) requirement for longer constituent filters and the insight that the limit on the number of stationary observations also limits the number of filter coefficients that can be effectively adapted. In the second part, the paper develops a theoretical model for wideband arrivals impinging upon an array of sensors of the multichannel equalizer. This model is used to develop an understanding that the optimal sensor separation is a tradeoff between the requirement for long aperture which improves resolution, and the fact that the grating lobes, caused by spatial undersampling, limit the equalizer's ability to estimate the transmitted signal from the received signal.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2015.2469935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7295647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/7295647/07271107.pdf","endPage":"774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Optimal Design of Multichannel Equalizer for Underwater Acoustic Communications","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2015.2469935","startPage":"759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Optimal Design of Multichannel Equalizer for Underwater Acoustic Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271107/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15520419","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7271107/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-11-10426, N00014-10-10259 and N00014-07-10738"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1102156"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Optimal Design of Multichannel Equalizer for Underwater Acoustic Communications","sourcePdf":"joe-pajovic-2469935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06755S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"7295647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7295647","articleId":"7271107","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7271109,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Alexander Chin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7271109/chin-2451658-small.gif","p":["Stephen Alexander Chin received the B.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the M.A.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2009 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering.","His current research interests include reconfigurable architectures and related computer-aided design for silicon efficiency."]},"firstName":"Stephen Alexander","lastName":"Chin","id":"37085648422"},{"name":"Jason Luu","affiliation":["Altera Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7271109/luu-2451658-small.gif","p":["Jason Luu received the B.A.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2007, and the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.","He has contributed eight years to the open source VTR project for field-programmable gate array computer-aided design and architecture research.

Technology mapping optimizations that target the proposed architectures are also implemented within ABC.

The critical impact of detrimental modeling uncertainties, such as NU, is analytically quantified and it is shown that the introduced method is robust to both NU and frequency-selectivity conditions. This is also the case for eigenvalue based sensing techniques, in contrast to traditional energy detector based sensing. Connections of the subband energy based approach and existing eigenvalue based methods are established analytically, which leads to a novel reduced complexity processing technique based on the difference between maximum and minimum subband energies. The proposed method is capable of providing accurate and robust performance with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in the presence of NU. Closed-form expressions are derived for the corresponding probability of false alarm and probability of detection under frequency selectivity due to the primary signal spectrum and/or the transmission channel. The validity of the offered expressions is justified through comparisons with respective results from computer simulations. The sensing performance is evaluated in different communication scenarios, with different frequency-selective channel models and primary user waveforms. The offered results indicate that the proposed methods provide quite significant savings in complexity, e.g., 78% reduction in the considered example case, while also improving the detection performance at low SNRs and in the presence of NU.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband Energy Based Reduced Complexity Spectrum Sensing Under Noise Uncertainty and Frequency-Selective Spectral Characteristics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2480048","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7343816/07271110.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2480048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Subband Energy Based Reduced Complexity Spectrum Sensing Under Noise Uncertainty and Frequency-Selective Spectral Characteristics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7271110/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15647664","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband Energy Based Reduced Complexity Spectrum Sensing Under Noise Uncertainty and Frequency-Selective Spectral Characteristics","sourcePdf":"tsp-dikmese-2480048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159949S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7343816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7343816","articleId":"7271110","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7271113,"authors":[{"name":"Berk Gurakan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7271113/gurak-2479626-small.gif","p":["Berk Gurakan (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, in May 2008 and December 2010, respectively.

In this network, nodes harvest energy from nature to sustain the power needed for data transmission, and may transfer a portion of their harvested energies to neighboring nodes through energy cooperation. For fixed data and energy routing topologies, we determine the optimum data rates, transmit powers, and energy transfers, subject to flow and energy conservation constraints, to minimize the network delay. We start with a simplified problem where data flows are fixed and optimize energy management at each node for the case of a single energy harvest per node. This is tantamount to distributing each node's available energy over its outgoing data links and energy transfers to neighboring nodes. For this case, with no energy cooperation, we show that each node should allocate more power to links with more noise and/or more data flow. In addition, when there is energy cooperation, our numerical results indicate that the energy is routed from nodes with lower data loads to nodes with higher data loads. We then extend this setting to the case of multiple energy harvests per node over time. In this case, we optimize each node's energy management over its outgoing data links and its energy transfers to neighboring nodes, over multiple time slots. For this case, with no energy cooperation, we show that, for any given node, the sum of powers on the outgoing links over time is equal to the single-link optimal power over time. Finally, we consider the problem of joint flow control and energy management for the entire network. We determine the necessary conditions for joint optimality of a power control, energy transfer, and routing policy. We provide an iterative algorithm that updates the data flows, energy flows, and power distribution over outgoing data links sequentially. We show that this algorithm converges to a Pareto-optimal operating point.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2479626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2479626","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07271113.pdf","startPage":"857","endPage":"870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Energy and Data Routing in Networks With Energy Cooperation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Energy and Data Routing in Networks With Energy Cooperation","volume":"15","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271113/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15785870","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271113/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS 13-14733, CCF 14-22111 and CCF 14-22129"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Asilomar Conference"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Energy and Data Routing in Networks With Energy Cooperation","sourcePdf":"twc-ulukus-2479626-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197852S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7271113","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7271114,"authors":[{"name":"Dechao Chen","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control, Guangzhou, China","SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute, Foshan, China","Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), School of Information Science and Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7963895/7271114/7271114-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dechao Chen received the B.S. degree in electronic information science and technology from the Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2013.

We propose a new standard-basis-based encoding/decoding method to leverage the performance and cost of CDMA NoCs in area, power assumption, and network throughput. In the transmitter module, source data from different senders are separately encoded with an orthogonal code of a standard basis and these coded data are mixed together by an XOR operation. Then, the sums of data can be transmitted to their destinations through the on-chip communication infrastructure. In the receiver module, a sequence of chips is retrieved by taking an AND operation between the sums of data and the corresponding orthogonal code. After a simple accumulation of these chips, original data can be reconstructed. We implement our encoding/decoding method and apply it to a CDMA NoC with a star topology. Compared with the state-of-the-art Walsh-code-based (WB) encoding/decoding technique, our method achieves up to 67.46% power saving and 81.24% area saving together with decrease of 30%-50% encoding/decoding latency. Moreover, the CDMA NoC with different sizes applying our encoding/decoding method gains power saving, area saving, and maximal throughput improvement up to 20.25%, 22.91%, and 103.26%, respectively, than the WB CDMA NoC.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2471077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7436835/07271115.pdf","startPage":"1607","endPage":"1611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2471077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7436835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New CDMA Encoding/Decoding Method for on-Chip Communication Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A New CDMA Encoding/Decoding Method for on-Chip Communication Network","volume":"24","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15874345","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271115/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271115/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program","grantNumber":"2014SZ0093"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M562303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Funds","grantNumber":"61201005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New CDMA Encoding/Decoding Method for on-Chip Communication Network","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wang-2471077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098548S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7436835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7436835","articleId":"7271115","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7271119,"authors":[{"name":"Caixing Shao","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Southwest University for Nationalities, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7355269/7271119/shao-2479942-small.gif","p":["\n\nCaixing Shao received the B.Eng. degree from Southwest University, \nChongqing, China, in 2006.

Grouping vehicles into platoons in VANETs can improve road safety and reduce fuel consumption. It is critical to design an efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol for platoon-based VANETs. Moreover, because of the space and time dynamics of moving vehicles, network connectivity is an important performance metric to indicate the quality of the network communications and the satisfaction of users. Unfortunately, network connectivity is often ignored in the design of existing MAC protocols for VANETs. In this paper, we study the connectivity characteristics and present a connectivity-aware MAC protocol for platoon-based VANETs. The connectivity probabilities are analyzed for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication scenarios in one- and two-way VANETs, respectively. A multipriority Markov model is presented to derive the relationship between connectivity probability and system throughput. Based on variable traffic status and network connectivity, a multichannel reservation scheme is adopted to dynamically adjust the length of the control channel interval and the service channel interval for the improvement of the system throughput. Analysis and simulation results show that the throughput increases with connectivity probability. However, with a further increase in connectivity probability, the throughput will decrease due to numerous channel contentions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"64","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15662003","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7271119/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Connectivity Probability and Connectivity-Aware MAC Protocol Design for Platoon-Based VANETs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374189"},{"fundingName":"Information Technology Research Projects of Ministry of Transport of China","grantNumber":"2014364X14040"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2013J009"},{"fundingName":"Research Council of Norway"},{"fundingName":"CROWN","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-627490"},{"fundingName":"ACDC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Connectivity Probability and Connectivity-Aware MAC Protocol Design for Platoon-Based VANETs","sourcePdf":"tvt-leng-2479942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119754S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7355269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"7355269","articleId":"7271119","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7271125,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Garcia","affiliation":["ME, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States"],"bio":{"p":["Manuel Garcia received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.","He is a Post-Master's Intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA.

The presented classifier is a linear multinomial regression model that is trained by solving a maximum likelihood optimization problem using synthetic data. The synthetic data is produced through dynamic simulations which are initialized by random samples of a forecast load/generation distribution. Real time computation of the proposed classifier is minimal and therefore the classifier is capable of locating a line outage before steady state is reached, allowing for quick corrective action in response to an outage. In addition, the output of the classifier fits into a statistical framework that is easily accessible. Specific line outages are identified as being difficult to localize and future improvements to the classifier are proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271125/","volume":"31","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7271125/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15985772","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Line Outage Localization Using Phasor Measurement Data in Transient State","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line Outage Localization Using Phasor Measurement Data in Transient State","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-garcia-2461461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1015S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7463573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7463573","articleId":"7271125","onlineDate":"17 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7271349,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno Pessanha Santos","affiliation":["Portuguese Navy Research Center (CINAV), Portuguese Navy (MGP), Almada, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno Pessanha","lastName":"Santos","id":"37085662756"},{"name":"Victor Lobo","affiliation":["Portuguese Navy Research Center (CINAV), Portuguese Navy (MGP), Almada, Portugal"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lobo","id":"37085661057"},{"name":"Alexandre Bernardino","affiliation":["Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR) Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST), Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Bernardino","id":"37442087500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8736-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7271349","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Estimation","Databases","Optimization","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filters","autonomous aerial vehicles","computer vision","entry, descent and landing (spacecraft)","genetic algorithms","mathematical operators","nonlinear filters","object tracking","particle filtering (numerical methods)","pose estimation","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV tracking","ground-based vision system","standard RGB digital camera","unmanned aerial vehicle","landing process","particle filter","pose estimation","unscented Kalman filter","UKF","adapted filtering","genetic algorithm","crossover operator","mutation operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Vision","Model Based Tracking","Autonomous Vehilcles","Military Systems","Particle Filters","Unscented Kalman Filters"]}],"abstract":"It is presented a vision system based on a standard RGB digital camera to track an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during the landing process aboard a ship. The developed vision system is located on the ship's deck and is used to track the UAV during all the landing process. A Ground-based vision system makes it possible to use an UAV with small size and weight, since the UAV will have less computer requirements. The proposed method uses a particle filter (PF) for pose estimation and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) approach for filtering. This combination provides an adapted filtering framework for tracking. The implemented particle filter is inspired in the evolution strategies present in genetic algorithms with modifications in the mutation and crossover operators to avoid sample impoverishment.

Apart from better mean arrival times, the adaptive sampling approach also results in significantly reduced variance of the arrival-time distribution.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271355","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271355.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sampling and collective behaviour in a small team of AUVs for a source localization problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sampling and collective behaviour in a small team of AUVs for a source localization problem","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271355/","accessionNumber":"15473513","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271355/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sampling and collective behaviour in a small team of AUVs for a source localization problem","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141202005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065312S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7271361,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie Kemna","affiliation":["Computer Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Kemna","id":"37901074600"},{"name":"David A.

To enable extensive, efficient and repeatable environmental monitoring, there is a need for `ready to sample' robot systems, which do not require individual vehicle control, or a lot of prior information. This paper describes an approach to decentralized adaptive formation control for environmental sampling. An autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) leads a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to sample a lake environment. The ASV passes a constraint to the AUVs, and the AUVs use this to choose an allowed formation, and solve the assignment problem to determine their position in the formation, in a distributed manner. The approach is tested in simulation and compared to leader-follower formation control. Results show the potential for constraint-induced formation switching in adaptive formation control towards a safe, fully autonomous heterogeneous team of lake sampling robots.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271361","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271361.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constraint-induced formation switching for adaptive environmental sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Constraint-induced formation switching for adaptive environmental sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7271361/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15473404","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreNote":"As originally published there is an error in this document. the authors omitted the following text: \"This work was supported in part by the Office of Naval research (N000141410536).\" The article PDF remains as originally published.","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271361/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraint-induced formation switching for adaptive environmental sampling","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141202015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060468S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7271372,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bousquet","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4R2"],"firstName":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Bousquet","id":"37298649100"},{"name":"Graham McIntyre","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4R2"],"firstName":"Graham","lastName":"McIntyre","id":"37085363435"},{"name":"Jean Quirion","affiliation":["Ultra Electronics Maritime Systems Halifax"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Quirion","id":"37085356753"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8736-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7271372","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receivers","Computational modeling","Transmitters","Underwater acoustics","Doppler effect","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","time-varying channels","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-variant acoustic propagation modeling","high-speed coherent multiple-input multiple-output transmission","underwater acoustic MIMO communication link","stochastic channel model","seaport measurement","Bedford basin","Halifax","bandwidth 400 Hz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a channel model used to develop a high-speed underwater acoustic MIMO communication link is described.

Balance parameters usually obtained through experiments. These kind of inaccurate parameters have a great influence on gliders gliding. In this article, a balance parameters calculation method of underwater glider based on BP neural network is presented. This study aims to find one of the most suitable balance parameters to improve the control effect of vehicles. Three steps are put forward to implement this approach. First, do at least two groups of pitch adjusting tests in the water and record the related data at the same time. Second, extract data and data preprocessing. Finally, use the BP Neural Network model to calculate balance parameters. The results of Qian-dao Lake test show that these parameters are appropriate and this calculation method is feasible.

It combines the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) into a single fast orthogonal unitary transform which increases channel diversity order without sacrificing any throughput. The proposed system uses pilot subcarriers for channel estimation and bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) as forward error correction (FEC) code for better bust error correction. Performance of the T-transform is compared to discrete cosine transform (DCT) based OFDM systems and conventional OFDM systems. Both tank test results and sea trial results reveal that the proposed T-OFDM system achieves significant performance improvement over DCT based OFDM and conventional OFDM in a frequency selective fading channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of T-transform based OFDM in underwater acoustic communications","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271510","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of T-transform based OFDM in underwater acoustic communications","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271510/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15473448","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of T-transform based OFDM in underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141205094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070716S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7271515,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Ferri","affiliation":["Research Department, NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, La Spezia, SP, Italy"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Ferri","id":"37534206500"},{"name":"Andrea Munaf\u00f2","affiliation":["Research Department, NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, La Spezia, SP, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Munaf\u00f2","id":"37298325000"},{"name":"Ryan Goldhahn","affiliation":["Research Department, NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, La Spezia, SP, Italy"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Goldhahn","id":"37700268100"},{"name":"Kevin LePage","affiliation":["Research Department, NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, La Spezia, SP, Italy"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"LePage","id":"37282023900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8736-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7271515","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"abstract":"We present an adaptive, data driven Mission Management Layer (MML) to manage the phases (surveillance, track prosecution and target reacquisition) of the mission of AUVs operating as receiver nodes in a multistatic network for littoral surveillance. Among the tracks produced by the on board tracker, the MML selects those which are likely originated by a target. The MML then issues commands to the vehicle Control Layer to trigger data-driven optimization behaviours to prosecute these candidate tracks. Selecting few candidate tracks is indeed crucial since the addressed scenario usually presents many tracks hence resulting challenging from the tracking point of view. To select the candidate tracks, a metric is introduced to quantify their quality. It is based on the kinematic features of the target, on an acoustic model and on the quality of measurement-to-track associations. By selecting a limited subset of produced tracks, the MML can improve the benefits of using data-driven behaviours activating them only on interesting cues and reducing the time wasted to optimize tracks not related to a target. This aims at achieving a balance between the surveillance of the area of interest and exploitation of target cues (tracks). These features are essential for improving the overall mission performance and for an effective AUV decision making in realistic conditions. We present results from sea trials demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and how the proposed MML can represent a step forward towards the full autonomy of our system. These results represent one of the first examples of AUVs autonomously taking decisions in a realistic and complex littoral surveillance scenario.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Surveillance","Vehicles","Covariance matrices","Optimization","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","oceanographic techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","ASW scenarios","AUV mission management layer","receiver nodes","multistatic network","acoustic model","measurement-to-track associations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271515","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271515.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards fully autonomous underwater vehicles in ASW scenarios: An adaptive, data driven AUV mission management layer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards fully autonomous underwater vehicles in ASW scenarios: An adaptive, data driven AUV mission management layer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271515/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271515/","accessionNumber":"15473577","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards fully autonomous underwater vehicles in ASW scenarios: An adaptive, data driven AUV mission management layer","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141205103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10109S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7271529,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Oleari","affiliation":["RIMLab-Robotics and Intelligent Machines Laboratory, University of Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Oleari","id":"37550290300"},{"name":"Fabjan Kallasi","affiliation":["RIMLab-Robotics and Intelligent Machines Laboratory, University of Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabjan","lastName":"Kallasi","id":"37085637407"},{"name":"Dario Lodi Rizzini","affiliation":["RIMLab-Robotics and Intelligent Machines Laboratory, University of Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Dario Lodi","lastName":"Rizzini","id":"37591144000"},{"name":"Jacopo Aleotti","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Parma, Parma, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"firstName":"Jacopo","lastName":"Aleotti"},{"name":"Stefano Caselli","affiliation":["RIMLab-Robotics and Intelligent Machines Laboratory, University of Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Caselli","id":"37330820300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8736-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7271529","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":389},"abstract":"This paper describes the hardware setup of a stereovision system for underwater 3D object detection and a camera calibration method that does not require complex underwater procedures.

Conventionally, researchers have used white noise models to simulate snapping shrimp noise. Though efficient in portraying the amplitude statistics, these models fail to represent the burstiness encountered in practical observations. We offer insights into the dependence between recorded noise samples. Scatter plots of closely spaced observations are shown to have near-elliptical geometries. Using this observation and the fact that stable distributions model outliers very well, we propose a memory model based on stable \u03b1-sub-Gaussian distributions. The new model offers a better match to empirical data in comparison to white and colored noise models currently employed in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271550.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling colored impulsive noise by Markov chains and alpha-stable processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Markov processes","Geometry","Data models","Random variables","Probability density function","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","Gaussian noise","impulse noise","Markov processes","underwater acoustic communication","white noise","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colored impulsive noise modelling","Markov chain","alpha stable process","warm shallow underwater channel","white noise model","snapping shrimp noise simulation","amplitude statistics","near elliptical geometry","memory model","stable \u03b1-sub-Gaussian distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modeling colored impulsive noise by Markov chains and alpha-stable processes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271550/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15473719","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling colored impulsive noise by Markov chains and alpha-stable processes","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141205150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085664S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7271565,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo M.

The ability to predict a vessel position in the future is essential to provide information on upcoming events.

Based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic mean-reverting processes, a novel method has been recently presented that enables the accurate prediction of future positions of a vessel under the hypothesis that it is following an established traffic pattern in the area. We present a large-scale extensive validation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck methodology applied to target predictions along routes in the maritime domain for several classes of vessel.

Equally promising results are presented for experiments with a 1.4kbps direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) variant, currently being implemented on the same platform, which demonstrates remarkable tolerance of extreme multipath channels and noise using a relatively low complexity receiver algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271578","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of the \u201cSeatrac\u201d miniature acoustic modem and USBL positioning units for subsea robotics and diver applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of the \u201cSeatrac\u201d miniature acoustic modem and USBL positioning units for subsea robotics and diver applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271578/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15473691","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7271578/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of the \u201cSeatrac\u201d miniature acoustic modem and USBL positioning units for subsea robotics and diver applications","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141205188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066852S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7271617,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Pailhas","affiliation":["Ocean Systems Lab, School of EPS Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Pailhas","id":"37294637900"},{"name":"Yvan Petillot","affiliation":["Ocean Systems Lab, School of EPS Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland"],"firstName":"Yvan","lastName":"Petillot","id":"38530535400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8736-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7271617","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Receivers","Scattering","Sonar","Image resolution","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","object detection","object recognition","parameter estimation","sonar arrays","sonar detection","sonar imaging","sonar target recognition","speckle","surveillance","synthetic aperture sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["midwater target parameter estimation","autofocus algorithm","shallow marine environment","equivalent synthetic aperture sonar system","equivalent SAS system","resolution surpass","super-resolution image","cell resolution","scatterer decorrelation","speckle target noise","target recognition","radar receiver","radar transmitter","area surveillance","target detection","harbour surveillance","multiple input multiple output sonar system","MIMO sonar system"]}],"abstract":"Multiple Input Multiple Output sonar systems offer new perspectives for target detection and area surveillance. This paper introduces MIMO sonar systems and focuses on its capabilities. The multiplication of the number of transmitters and receivers not only provides a greater variety in terms of target view angles but provides also in meaningful statistics on the target itself. Assuming that views are independent and the MIMO system is large enough we demonstrate that target recognition is possible with only one view from the full system. We also demonstrate that such systems solve the speckle target noise and decorrelate individual scatterers within one cell resolution. We show that MIMO systems can achieve super-resolution images and surpass the resolution given by equivalent SAS (Synthetic Aperture Sonar) systems. To demonstrate those capabilities we develop a physic based MIMO simulator capable of modelling cluttered and very shallow marine environment similar of harbour environment. Thanks to the simulator and taking advantage of the degree of freedom that MIMO systems offers, we also present autofocus algorithms that automatically estimates mid-water target parameters such as speed, orientation or depth.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271617","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271617.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO sonar systems for harbour surveillance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO sonar systems for harbour surveillance","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271617/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15473406","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7271617/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO sonar systems for harbour surveillance","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141205254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047687S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7271646,"authors":[{"name":"Yongwei Wang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yongwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085636459"},{"name":"Yixin Yang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280589200"},{"name":"Lingji Xu","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lingji","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085639312"},{"name":"Xiaohui Bai","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Bai","id":"37085718335"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8736-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7271646","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271646","abstract":"By exploiting the intrinsic sparse structure of the underwater acoustic channel, we adopt \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-\u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n optimization criterion, which incorporates least squares with the penalized \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization to reduce noise effects while inducing channel sparsity.

To address this problem, a different approach to beamform with nonsinusoidal signal for grating lobes suppression is proposed in this paper. The desirable nonsinusoidal signal can be obtained by exacting the envelopes of the received signals. The reception of the envelopes with short time duration is identical to weak signal detection and matched filtering is employed to enhance the signal-noise-ratio (SNR). And then beamforming with signal envelopes in time domain is investigated. As the signal envelope is nonperiodic, grating lobes can be eliminated from the beam pattern and the element spacing is not restricted by half of the wavelength. The array designed with the proposed method is a kind of sparse arrays. Such an array with only a few elements leads to low-complexity and low-cost imaging system. The validity of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations and the results show the proposed method can achieve a better performance of beam pattern than the conventional method with sinusoidal signals.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271722","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271722.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271722","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming with nonsinusoidal signal for grating lobes suppression in underwater acoustic imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming with nonsinusoidal signal for grating lobes suppression in underwater acoustic imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271722/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271722/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15473701","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming with nonsinusoidal signal for grating lobes suppression in underwater acoustic imaging","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141219052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081387S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7271746,"authors":[{"name":"Toros Arikan","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, West Main St. Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Toros","lastName":"Arikan","id":"37085728207"},{"name":"Thomas Riedl","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, West Main St. Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Riedl","id":"37409119700"},{"name":"Andrew Singer","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, West Main St. Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Singer","id":"37085355250"},{"name":"James Younce","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, West Main St. Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Younce","id":"37085729809"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8736-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7164-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7271746","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","OFDM","Receivers","Transmitters","Underwater acoustics","Mathematical model","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic measurement","adaptive equalisers","Doppler measurement","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","single-carrier schemes","Doppler tolerant acoustic communications","signal transmission","wave propagation","single-carrier adaptive resampling equalizer"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) implicitly assumes that the channel used for signal transmission is linear and time-invariant for the length of each OFDM symbol. This is necessary for the channel matrix to be diagonalizable via the DFT, under cyclic prefix. The underwater acoustic channel is highly time-variant due to platform motion and environmental fluctuations. As a result, the application of standard OFDM leads to communication algorithms that break down when the transmitter or receiver are mobile. Several modifications to standard OFDM have been suggested and tested in the field. These have demonstrated that OFDM can perform reasonably well when the Doppler spread is minor. Unfortunately, Doppler can be highly time-varying in practice, with different wave propagation paths experiencing different amounts of Doppler. In this paper, we simulate various scenarios of platform mobility such as a receiver moving at constant speed or acceleration, a transmitter whose position is tracing out an oscillating pattern near a nominal transmission point, and basic multipath with significant Doppler spread. We compare the performance of published OFDM and single-carrier methods under these conditions. The single-carrier adaptive resampling equalizer presented here demonstrates significant improvement over OFDM in a variety of scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271746","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2015 - Genova","pdfPath":"/iel7/7227859/7271237/07271746.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of OFDM and single-carrier schemes for Doppler Tolerant Acoustic Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7271746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7271746/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of OFDM and single-carrier schemes for Doppler Tolerant Acoustic Communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15473603","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7271746/","conferenceDate":"18-21 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of OFDM and single-carrier schemes for Doppler Tolerant Acoustic Communications","confLoc":"Genova, Italy","sourcePdf":"141219101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054475S","chronDate":"18-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7227859","isNumber":"7271237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7227859","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7271237","articleId":"7271746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272037,"authors":[{"name":"Stylianos Papaharalabos","affiliation":["Laboratory of Wireless Communications, National Centre for Scientific Research \u2018Demokritos\u2019, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Stylianos","lastName":"Papaharalabos","id":"38338563400"},{"name":"P.

Fig. (a) illustrates the relationships among the capacity region of the broadcast channel (BC), and the rate regions achieved by NOMA and TDMA for a given channel pair. One observation from the figures is that the NOMA region is a part of the BC capacity region. Furthermore, we are interested in the two region boundaries, i.e., the curve A-F and the segment A-E, which represent the optimal rate pairs achieved by NOMA and TDMA, respectively. Fig. (b) compares the rate pairs achieved by the NOMA and TDMA schemes for a given channel pair, and illustrates the event in which the point T lies on the sub-segment B-C. Specifically, four events \u2130\u2081, \u2130\u2082, \u2130\u2083 and \u2130\u2084 are corresponding to the four cases in which T lies on A-B, B-C, C-D and D-E, respectively. Of particular interest is \u2130\u2082 as shown in this figure, which represents the situation in which NOMA outperforms TDMA in terms of not only the sum rate but also each individual rate. Furthermore, when considering random channels in a wireless network with fixed power allocation, the \u2130i\u2019s become random events. So analyzing the probability of each event, i.e., P(\u2130i), can statistically reflect the performance of NOMA in terms of both the sum rate and individual rates, which forms the basic idea of the proposed evaluation criterion. Analytical results show that P(\u2130\u2082)\u21921 when the difference between the users' channels is large, which reflects the fact that NOMA outperforms TDMA in terms of both the sum rate and individual rates for almost all the possible channel realizations.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"45KB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7272042/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2480117.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7272042/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2480117.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Broadcasting","5G mobile communication","Software defined networking","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","broadcast channels","fading channels","software defined networking","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["point of view theoretic","wireless fading scenarios","optimal power allocation","wireless downlink","TDMA","time division multiple access","broadcast channel","NOMA","5G software defined network","nonorthogonal multiple access","evaluation criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NOMA","capacity region of the broadcast channel","sum rates","individual rates"]},{"kwd":["NOMA","capacity region of the broadcast channel","sum rates","individual rates"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new evaluation criterion is developed to investigate the performance of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) from an information theoretic point of view. In particular, the relations among the capacity region of the broadcast channel and two rate regions achieved by NOMA and time-division multiple access (TDMA) are first illustrated. Based on these relations, a new evaluation criterion is proposed for NOMA in wireless fading scenarios, where the key idea is to compare NOMA with TDMA statistically in terms of not only the sum rate but also the individual rates. In a wireless downlink scenario with user pairing, the developed analytical results show that NOMA can outperform TDMA not only in terms of the sum rate but also in terms of each user's individual rate, particularly when the difference between the users' channels is large. The optimal power allocation for a special case of NOMA user pairing is also established.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2480117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

high-resolution satellite images, more and more research efforts have been placed on remote sensing scene classification/recognition. In scene classification, effective feature selection can significantly boost the final performance. In this letter, a novel deep-learning-based feature-selection method is proposed, which formulates the feature-selection problem as a feature reconstruction problem. Note that the popular deep-learning technique, i.e., the deep belief network (DBN), achieves feature abstraction by minimizing the reconstruction error over the whole feature set, and features with smaller reconstruction errors would hold more feature intrinsics for image representation. Therefore, the proposed method selects features that are more reconstructible as the discriminative features. Specifically, an iterative algorithm is developed to adapt the DBN to produce the inquired reconstruction weights. In the experiments, 2800 remote sensing scene images of seven categories are collected for performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2015.2475299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7305891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2015.2475299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7305891/07272047.pdf","startPage":"2321","endPage":"2325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Feature Selection for Remote Sensing Scene Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Feature Selection for Remote Sensing Scene Classification","volume":"12","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272047/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15567014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272047/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301277 and 41371431"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB719906 and 2012CB725303"},{"fundingName":"3551 Optics Valley Talents Scheme of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Zone"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Feature Selection for Remote Sensing Scene Classification","sourcePdf":"lgrs-zhang-2475299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083609S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7305891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"327","xplore-issue":"7305891","articleId":"7272047","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7272049,"authors":[{"name":"Guan-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7563473/7272049/gulin-2480070-small.gif","p":["Guan-Yu Lin received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan in 2008, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University.","His research interests include evaluating system performance, designing protocols for wireless communication systems, and studying resource allocation problems in communication systems with game-theoretical approaches."]},"firstName":"Guan-Yu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37856320700"},{"name":"Hung-Yu Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7563473/7272049/huwei-2480070-small.gif","p":["Hung-Yu Wei received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU) Taipei, Taiwan, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, NTU.

Through the two-stage scheme, we can efficiently handle a great number of random access request coming from diverse M2M applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7272049/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16286978","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Auction-Based Random Access Load Control for Time-Dependent Machine-to-Machine Communications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002875","fundingName":"Chunghwa Telecom"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006477","fundingName":"National Taiwan University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":"Intel Corporation","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2911-I-002-001, NTU-ICRP-104R7501 and NTU-ICRP-104R7501-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auction-Based Random Access Load Control for Time-Dependent Machine-to-Machine Communications","sourcePdf":"jiot-wei-2480070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084206S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7563473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7563473","articleId":"7272049","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7272058,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Typically, vision-based sensors are used to detect the traffic light. However, the detection of traffic lights using computer vision, image processing, and learning algorithms is not trivial. The challenges include appearance variations, illumination variations, and reduced appearance information in low illumination conditions. To address these challenges, we present a visual camera-based real-time traffic light detection algorithm, where we identify the spatially constrained region-of-interest in the image containing the traffic light. Given, the identified region-of-interest, we achieve high traffic light detection accuracy with few false positives, even in adverse environments. To perform robust traffic light detection in varying conditions with few false positives, the proposed algorithm consists of two steps, an offline saliency map generation and a real-time traffic light detection. In the offline step, a convolutional neural network, i.e., a deep learning framework, detects and recognizes the traffic lights in the image using region-of-interest information provided by an onboard GPS sensor. The detected traffic light information is then used to generate the saliency maps with a modified multidimensional density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (M-DBSCAN) algorithm. The generated saliency maps are indexed using the vehicle GPS information. In the real-time step, traffic lights are detected by retrieving relevant saliency maps and performing template matching by using colour information. The proposed algorithm is validated with the datasets acquired in varying conditions and different countries, e.g., USA, Japan, and France. The experimental results report a high detection accuracy with negligible false positives under varied illumination conditions. More importantly, an average computational time of 10 ms/frame is achieved. A detailed parameter analysis is conducted and the observations are summarized and reported in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553510","htmlLink":"/document/7272062/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Saliency Map Generation by the Convolutional Neural Network for Real-Time Traffic Light Detection Using Template Matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency Map Generation by the Convolutional Neural Network for Real-Time Traffic Light Detection Using Template Matching","sourcePdf":"tci-john-2480006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115806S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"7302098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7302098","articleId":"7272062","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7272068,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhi Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7312523/7272068/hoguo-2480095-small.gif","p":["Hongzhi Guo (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in automation with a minor in economics from Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, in 2013.

Large SRAM structures, like the last-level cache (LLC), are extremely vulnerable to process variation because they are aggressively sized to satisfy high density requirements. In this paper, we propose Concertina, an LLC designed to enable reliable operation at low voltages with conventional SRAM cells. Based on the observation that for many applications the LLC contains large amounts of null data, Concertina compresses cache blocks in order that they can be allocated to cache entries with faulty cells, enabling use of 100 percent of the LLC capacity. To distribute blocks among cache entries, Concertina implements a compression- and fault-aware insertion/replacement policy that reduces the LLC miss rate. Concertina reaches the performance of an ideal system implementing an LLC that does not suffer from parameter variation with a modest storage overhead. Specifically, performance degrades by less than 2 percent, even when using small SRAM cells, which implies over 90 percent of cache entries having defective cells, and this represents a notable improvement on previously proposed techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7401237/07272076.pdf","startPage":"755","endPage":"769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2479585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2479585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concertina: Squeezing in Cache Content to Operate at Near-Threshold Voltage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","Circuit faults","Transistors","Reliability","System-on-chip","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","power aware computing","power consumption","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache content","near-threshold voltage","supply voltage scaling","power consumption","processors","process variation","reliability","SRAM structures","last-level cache","high density requirements","SRAM cells","cache blocks","cache entries","faulty cells","compression-aware insertion/replacement policy","fault-aware insertion/replacement policy","LLC miss rate"]},{"kwd":["Near-threshold voltage","SRAM variability","fault-tolerance","on-chip caches"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Concertina: Squeezing in Cache Content to Operate at Near-Threshold Voltage","volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7272076/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15775430","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Arag\u00f3n Government"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002854","fundingName":"European ESF","grantNumber":"TIN2013-46957-C2-1-P and TIN2012-34557"},{"fundingName":"Consolider NoE","grantNumber":"TIN2014-52608-REDC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concertina: Squeezing in Cache Content to Operate at Near-Threshold Voltage","sourcePdf":"tc-ferreron-2479585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12165S","chronDate":"March 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7401237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7401237","articleId":"7272076","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7272087,"authors":[{"name":"Achilles Theodorakopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Achilles","lastName":"Theodorakopoulos","id":"37085465734"},{"name":"George A.

In this work, the \u03b8-logarithmic barrier-based method is employed to reformulate the economic dispatch problem, and the consensus-based approach is considered for developing fully distributed technology-enabled algorithms. Specifically, a novel distributed algorithm utilizes the minimum connected dominating set (CDS), which efficiently allocates the task of balancing supply and demand for the entire power network at the beginning of economic dispatch. Further, an event-triggered communication-based method for the incremental cost of each generator is able to reach a consensus, coinciding with the global optimality of the objective function. In addition, a fast gradient-based distributed optimization method is also designed to accelerate the convergence rate of the event-triggered distributed optimization. Simulations based on the IEEE 57-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness and good performance of proposed algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Event-Triggered Scheme for Economic Dispatch in Smart Grids","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2479558","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7742433/07272089.pdf","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2479558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7742433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Event-Triggered Scheme for Economic Dispatch in Smart Grids","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7272089/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16448652","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Scheme","grantNumber":"140100544"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61322302 and 61304152"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"2014-DZXX-004"},{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"NPRP 4-1162-1-181"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Event-Triggered Scheme for Economic Dispatch in Smart Grids","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2479558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099192S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7742433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"7742433","articleId":"7272089","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7272090,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7302100/7272090/7272090-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Wang (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electronics and information engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2011, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.","She was an Exchange Student with the Tokyo Institute of Technology International Research Opportunities Program (TiROP), Tokyo, Japan, in 2012.

It is a challenging problem due to the non-rigid deformation, illumination changes, and inter-class similarity. We propose a novel framework based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Concretely, we propose a new CNN model, called feature selective joint classification - regression CNN (FSCR-CNN). Its advantages lie in two folds: 1) it alleviates the illumination changes by a feature selection strategy to focus on the color- nondiscriminative features in the network learning, and 2) rather than only targeting on the hard label (i.e., the handbag model), it also incorporates a soft label (i.e., a distribution measuring the similarity between the ground truth model and all the models to be trained) to construct the loss function for training CNN, which leads to a better classifier for handbags with large inter-class similarity. We evaluate the performance of our framework on a newly built branded handbag dataset. The results show that it performs favorably for recognizing handbags with 94.48% in accuracy. We also apply the proposed FSCR-CNN model in recognizing other fine-grained objects with state-of-the-art CNN architectures, which is able to achieve over 5% improvement in accuracy.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7302100/07272090.pdf","startPage":"2072","endPage":"2083","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2015.2480228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2015.2480228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DeepBag: Recognizing Handbag Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"DeepBag: Recognizing Handbag Models","htmlLink":"/document/7272090/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15553479","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"MDA/IDM/2012/8/8-81 Vol01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeepBag: Recognizing Handbag Models","sourcePdf":"tmm-wang-2480228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115113S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7272090","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7272093,"authors":[{"name":"Fengji Luo","affiliation":["Faculty of Software Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","Centre for Intelligent Electricity Networks, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Fengji Luo (M\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in software engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia, in 2013.","He is currently a Research Associate with the Centre for Intelligent Electricity Networks, University of Newcastle.

The proposed converter is composed of two coupled inductors which can be integrated into one magnetic core, two capacitors, two active switches, and three diodes. The primary sides of coupled inductors are charged in parallel by the input source, and the secondary sides of coupled inductors are discharged in series with the input source and two capacitors to achieve high step-up voltage gain with an appropriate duty ratio. The two sets of diode-capacitor circuits not only help to lift the voltage conversion gain but also alleviate voltage spike affected by the leakage inductance to limit the voltage stress across the power switch effectively. Therefore, the two low on-state resistance switches can be adopted to reduce conduction loss. Furthermore, the two diodes have no reverse-recovery problem due to turn off naturally, the reverse-recovery problem of the output diode is also alleviated by the leakage inductor and lower part count is needed; therefore, the power conversion efficiency can be further improved. The operating principles and steady-state analyses are discussed in detail; then, the performance of the proposed converter is compared with existing converters. Finally, a prototype is established in the laboratory, and the experimental results are given to verify the correctness of the analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7394209/07272097.pdf","startPage":"5030","endPage":"5039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2480115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2480115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel High Step-up Converter With a Quasi-active Switched-Inductor Structure for Renewable Energy Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Switches","Capacitors","Switching circuits","Stress","Low voltage","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled circuits","DC-DC power convertors","inductors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high step-up converter","quasiactive switched inductor structure","renewable energy systems","DC-DC converter","coupled inductors","diode-capacitor circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High step-up voltage gain","quasi active switched-inductor","DC-DC converter","low voltage stress"]},{"kwd":["DC\u2013DC converter","high step-up voltage gain","low voltage stress","quasi-active switched-inductor (QA-SL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Novel High Step-up Converter With a Quasi-active Switched-Inductor Structure for Renewable Energy Systems","volume":"31","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7272097/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15754677","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"specialized research fund for the doctoral program of higher education","grantNumber":"20132302110013"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral science-research developmental foundation of Heilongjiang province","grantNumber":"LHB-Q12086"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China 973 Program","grantNumber":"2013CB035605"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51107016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel High Step-up Converter With a Quasi-active Switched-Inductor Structure for Renewable Energy Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2480115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077459S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7272097","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7272098,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, the State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7503130/7272098/xie-2480064-small.gif","p":["Hongwei Xie received the BS degree from the Computer and Information\n Department, Hehai University, China, in 2012.

Particle filter is often used to improve accuracy. However, most of existing particle filter based approaches either are heavily affected by motion estimation errors, which result in unreliable systems, or impose strong restrictions on smartphone such as fixed phone orientation, which are not practical for real-life use. In this paper, we present a novel indoor positioning system for smartphones, which is built on our proposed reliability-augmented particle filter. We create several innovations on the motion model, the measurement model, and the resampling model to enhance the basic particle filter. To minimize errors in motion estimation and improve the robustness of the basic particle filter, we propose a dynamic step length estimation algorithm and a heuristic particle resampling algorithm. We use a hybrid measurement model, combining a new magnetic fingerprinting model and the existing magnitude fingerprinting model, to improve system performance, and importantly avoid calibrating magnetometers for different smartphones. In addition, we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm to reduce computation overhead, which in turn improves overall usability tremendously. Finally, we also analyze the \u201cKidnapped Robot Problem\u201d and present a practical solution. We conduct comprehensive experimental studies, and the results show that our system achieves an accuracy of 1~2 m on average in a large building.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7503130/07272098.pdf","startPage":"1877","endPage":"1892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2480064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2480064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7503130","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reliability-Augmented Particle Filter for Magnetic Fingerprinting Based Indoor Localization on Smartphone","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetometers","Accuracy","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Estimation","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor navigation","indoor radio","magnetic fields","motion estimation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","radionavigation","reliability","signal sampling","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability-augmented particle filter","magnetic fingerprinting based indoor localization","magnetic field data","smart phone indoor positioning","motion estimation error minimization","fixed phone orientation","motion model","resampling model","dynamic step length estimation algorithm","heuristic particle resampling algorithm","hybrid measurement model","magnetometer calibration","adaptive sampling algorithm","computation overhead reduction","kidnapped robot problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor localization","magnetic","particle filter","smartphone"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Reliability-Augmented Particle Filter for Magnetic Fingerprinting Based Indoor Localization on Smartphone","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7272098/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16122695","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61373011, 91318301, 61272456 and 61472312"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups","grantNumber":"61321491"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reliability-Augmented Particle Filter for Magnetic Fingerprinting Based Indoor Localization on Smartphone","sourcePdf":"tmc-gu-2480064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182712S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7503130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"7503130","articleId":"7272098","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7272106,"authors":[{"name":"Dukju Ahn","affiliation":["Incheon National University, Incheon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7272106/ahn-small.gif","p":["Dukju Ahn received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from\n Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the\n Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently with Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, as a Senior Research Engineer.\n His research interests include wireless power transfer, near-field communication, and analog/RF integrated circuit\n design for biomedical and portable applications.","Dr. Ahn received the Encouragement Prize in the 17th Human-Tech Thesis Contest from Samsung Electronics in 2011."]},"firstName":"Dukju","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37853514100"},{"name":"Patrick P.

The two coils then support separate coil drivers, enabling concurrent multistandard operation. Dual-band operation is achieved in the same area as an equivalent single-band design by placing a low-frequency coil within the geometry of a high-frequency coil, where the outer diameter of inner coil is sacrificed only by 1.2 cm in a 12.5 \u00d7 8.9-cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n design.

well-established methodology to assess local myocardial motion/deformation. Typically, a frame rate of ~ 200 Hz can be achieved by imaging a narrow sector ( ~ 30\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\n, covering one cardiac wall) at moderate line density, using a dedicated pulse sequence and multi-line acquisition. However, a wide angle field-of-view is required in some clinical applications to image the whole left ventricle, which implies a drop in temporal resolution. Hereto, the aim of this study was to propose a novel imaging sequence using a multi-line transmit (MLT) beamforming approach to achieve high frame rate color TDI while preserving a wide field-of-view (i.e., 90 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\n sector). To this end, a color MLT-TDI sequence achieving a frame rate of 208 Hz with a 90 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\n-sector was implemented on an ultrasound experimental scanner interleaved with a conventional color TDI sequence achieving the same frame rate but only with a 22.5 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\n-sector. Using this setup, the septal wall of 9 healthy volunteers was imaged and the corresponding velocity was extracted. The M-mode velocity images and the velocity profiles obtained from the MLT-TDI images presented physiologic patterns, very similar to those from conventional TDI. Moreover, for the peak systolic/diastolic velocities, good agreement and strong correlation between MLT-TDI and conventional TDI were found. The results thus demonstrate the feasibility of the novel MLT based TDI methodology to achieve high frame rate color TDI without compromising the field-of-view. This may open the opportunity to simultaneously assess regional myocardial function of the whole left ventricle at high temporal resolution.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2480061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7396977/07272108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2480061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396977","startPage":"521","endPage":"528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-Angle Tissue Doppler Imaging at High Frame Rate Using Multi-Line Transmit Beamforming: An Experimental Validation In Vivo","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wide-Angle Tissue Doppler Imaging at High Frame Rate Using Multi-Line Transmit Beamforming: An Experimental Validation In Vivo","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755139","pubMedId":"26394417","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7272108/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union through the ENIAC JU project DeNeCoR","grantNumber":"324257"},{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Education University and Research","grantNumber":"PRIN 2010-2011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"FP7/2007-2013/ERC Grant Agreement No. 281748"},{"fundingName":"National Postdoctoral Exchange Program - Import Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M560094"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"6127113 and 61322101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-Angle Tissue Doppler Imaging at High Frame Rate Using Multi-Line Transmit Beamforming: An Experimental Validation In Vivo","sourcePdf":"tmi-tong-2480061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061996S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7396977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7396977","articleId":"7272108","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7272120,"authors":[{"name":"Venkatesan N.

In our proposed architecture, the vehicular cloud acts as a cloud service provider for smartphones. Moreover, we propose a flexible offloading strategy (FOS) to carry out task migration. The vehicular cloud is able to discover and utilize the underutilized resources in vehicles to accomplish application offloading for smartphones. The FOS estimates the efficiency of various cloud service providers based on current resource conditions and then selects the suitable cloud service provider to perform the requested task.

As a consequence, the spurious intermodulation distortion products created by the nonlinear RF front-end of the TX may easily extend over to the RX band, potentially causing own RX desensitization. In this paper, we propose an efficient and computationally feasible adaptive digital identification and cancellation technique to mitigate the RX desensitization. We first show that the spurious leakage signal at own RX band depends on an equivalent leakage channel that models the overall signal leakage path including the TX nonlinearities, duplexer filter responses, and RX path. The parameters of the equivalent leakage channel can be efficiently estimated with the least squares or the recursive least squares algorithm, using the actual digital transmit data as a reference, and then used to regenerate and cancel the leakage interference from the received signal. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated with extensive computer simulations, as well as with practical real-world RF measurements, demonstrating excellent calibration properties with up to 19-dB improvement in singal-to-interference plus noise ratio of the desired received signal.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Transceivers","Radio frequency","Interference","Long Term Evolution","Nonlinear distortion","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","receivers","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital mitigation","transmitter-induced receiver desensitization","carrier aggregation FDD transceivers","frequency division duplexing devices","nonlinear RF front-end","adaptive digital identification and cancellation technique","RX desensitization","recursive least squares algorithm","commercial LTE mobile device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier aggregation (CA)","frequency division duplexing (FDD)","in-phase-quadrature (I/Q) imbalance","interference cancellation","intermodulation distortion (IMD)","long-term evolution (LTE)-Advanced","spurious emissions"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2478005","startPage":"3608","endPage":"3623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7317615/07272125.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2478005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Mitigation of Transmitter-Induced Receiver Desensitization in Carrier Aggregation FDD Transceivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Digital Mitigation of Transmitter-Induced Receiver Desensitization in Carrier Aggregation FDD Transceivers","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15571596","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","volume":"63","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2015","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272125/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Mitigation of Transmitter-Induced Receiver Desensitization in Carrier Aggregation FDD Transceivers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kiayani-2478005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076384S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7317615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7317615","articleId":"7272125","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7272127,"authors":[{"name":"Kamran Zaidi","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, City University London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7272127/zaidi-2480244-small.gif","p":["\n\nKamran Zaidi received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from \nNational University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 1999 and the M.Sc. degree in electronics \nengineering from London Metropolitan University, London, U.K., in 2003.

The IDS is evaluated by simulation in the presence of rogue nodes (RNs) that can launch different attacks. The proposed IDS is capable of detecting a false information attack using statistical techniques effectively and can also detect other types of attacks. First, the theory and implementation of the VANET model that is used to train the IDS is discussed. Then, an extensive simulation and analysis of our model under different traffic conditions is conducted to identify the effects of these parameters in VANETs. In addition, the extensive data gathered in the simulations are presented using graphical and statistical techniques. Moreover, RNs are introduced in the network, and an algorithm is presented to detect these RNs. Finally, we evaluate our system and observe that the proposed application-layer IDS based on a cooperative information exchange mechanism is better for dynamic and fast-moving networks such as VANETs, as compared with other techniques available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","volume":"65","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16210010","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7272127/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Host-Based Intrusion Detection for VANETs: A Statistical Approach to Rogue Node Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Host-Based Intrusion Detection for VANETs: A Statistical Approach to Rogue Node Detection","sourcePdf":"tvt-zaidi-2480244-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.233393S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7272127","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7272129,"authors":[{"name":"Chan-Hsiang Weng","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7307914/7272129/7272129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chan-Hsiang Weng received the B.S. degree from National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2005, 2008 and 2015, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 2008 to 2011, he was a mixed-signal design engineer with Airoha Corp., Hsinchu, Taiwan, during which time he was involved in the development of wireless for FM, BT, and audio applications.

In this work, a thermistor-embedded continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM), which merges these two building blocks into one, is proposed for a hardware- and energy-efficient temperature acquisition. The thermistor-based sensing front-end is reused in a 2nd-order 1 bit CTDSM to attain a high-resolution, low hardware complexity, and energy-efficient temperature sensing. Furthermore, a resistor-ladder with a switch on-resistance compensation scheme is proposed to implement the trimming circuit. Over a range of -45\u00b0C ~ 125\u00b0C, the proposed smart temperature sensor consumes 64.5 \u03bcW from 1.5 V supply voltage and achieves a resolution around 0.01\u00b0C rms (1 \u03c3) temperature resolution with a single conversion time of 100 \u03bcs.

However, SRAM-based multicontext FPGAs still suffer from high leakage power during sleep, slow power-ON speed, and excessive large memory area. Racetrack memory is one of the most promising resistive nonvolatile memories, with the advantages of low power, high density, and high speed. In this paper, we propose two racetrack memory-based nonvolatile storage elements (NVSEs) for multicontext FPGAs. One is the shifting-based NVSE (type-1) with the advantages of high density and low power. The other one is the address-based NVSE (type-2) with the advantages of high context switching speed and low context switching power. The versatile place and route simulation results show that the type-1 NVSE-based eight-context FPGA reduces the area, critical path delay, and the power of the SRAM-based eight-context FPGA by more than 68.1%, 22.8%, and 13%, respectively. The proposed type-2 NVSE-based FPGAs allow the contexts to be switched 4.46 times faster than the type-1 NVSE-based FPGAs. Both designs improve the FPGA power-ON speed by more than a million times. Compared with the conventional racetrack memory-based lookup table (LUT), the proposed racetrack memory-based LUT may reduce the total power by more than 25%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2474706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7456352/07272137.pdf","startPage":"1885","endPage":"1894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2474706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7456352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Racetrack Memory-Based Nonvolatile Storage Elements for Multicontext FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"Racetrack Memory-Based Nonvolatile Storage Elements for Multicontext FPGAs","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935068","htmlLink":"/document/7272137/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Racetrack Memory-Based Nonvolatile Storage Elements for Multicontext FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-huang-2474706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11988S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7456352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7456352","articleId":"7272137","onlineDate":"18 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272138,"authors":[{"name":"Moonsik Min","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7272138/momin-2480069-small.gif","p":["Moonsik Min received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering and the B.S. degree in mathematics from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Kyungbuk, Korea, in 2010.

However, previous studies mostly focused on the chordal distance (ChD) for channel quantization, although it is not an optimally designed distance measure. Thus, the possibility exists that the same degree of multiplexing gain can be obtained by using fewer feedback bits than the existing method requires. In this paper, we propose an optimal distance measure that can maximize the multiplexing gain achieved by limited-feedback-based block diagonalization over broadcast channels. Then, we provide a sufficient condition for the number of feedback bits to achieve a specific degree of multiplexing gain with the proposed method. The sufficient number of feedback bits is given by a linear function of the SNR (decibel) as in previous studies, but the slope of the linear increase can be much less than that obtained in previous studies. As a consequence, the proposed method achieves higher multiplexing gain and corresponding throughput than the existing methods with the same number of feedback bits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

on vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) contacted phase-change memory (PCM) array is performed using the 3-D time-domain finite-element method. The in-house-developed algorithm is verified by comparing the simulated results with the experimental ones published by others. Thermal coupling between adjacent cells, which may cause current leakage and reliability degradation, is characterized for PCMs with different geometrical parameters, which could be caused by fabrication variation. It is shown that spacing variation between adjacent PCM cells draws a slight effect on their thermal coupling. However, thermal boundary resistance of the phase-change material-oxide interface and SWCNT diameter affect temperature rise and thermal coupling significantly. On the other hand, it is indicated that the SWCNT contacted PCM has microampere-scale programming current and nanosecond-scale thermal response time, which make it vulnerable to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Electrothermal responses to ESD are captured and compared, which show that unintentional ESD can change the state of PCM and result in error programming.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2466674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7272173/07272178.pdf","startPage":"3258","endPage":"3263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2466674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrothermal Investigation on Vertically Aligned Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Contacted Phase-Change Memory Array for 3-D ICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Electrothermal Investigation on Vertically Aligned Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Contacted Phase-Change Memory Array for 3-D ICs","volume":"62","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15457247","htmlLink":"/document/7272178/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61171037, 61431014 and 61504121"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology on High Power Microwave Laboratory Fund respectively","grantNumber":"No.2014- 762.XY.K"},{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation Award","grantNumber":"CCF-1017000"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrothermal Investigation on Vertically Aligned Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Contacted Phase-Change Memory Array for 3-D ICs","sourcePdf":"ted-chen-2466674-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076605S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7272173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7272173","articleId":"7272178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272462,"authors":[{"name":"Ingvild K.

However, motion will cause out-of-phase summation, potentially causing image degradation. In this work the impact of blood motion on SNR and the accuracy of Doppler velocity estimates are investigated. A simplified model for the compounded Doppler signal is proposed. The model is used to show that coherent compounding acts as a low-pass filter on the coherent compounding Doppler signal, resulting in negatively biased velocity estimates. Simulations and flow phantom experiments are used to quantify the bias and Doppler SNR for different velocities and beam-to-flow (BTF) angles. It is shown that the bias in the mean velocity increases with increasing beam-to-flow angle and/or blood velocity, whereas the SNR decreases; losses up to 4 dB were observed in the investigated scenarios. Further, a 2-D motion correction scheme is proposed based on multi-angle vector Doppler velocity estimates. For a velocity of 1.1 vNyq and a BTF angle of 75\u00b0, the bias was reduced from 30% to less than 4% in simulations. The motion correction scheme was also applied to flow phantom and in vivo recordings, in both cases resulting in a substantially reduced mean velocity bias and an SNR less dependent on blood velocity and direction.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2015.007010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272171","startPage":"1634","endPage":"1643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7272171/07272462.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent compounding in doppler imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7272462/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coherent compounding in doppler imaging","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15474831","pubMedId":"26415126","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent compounding in doppler imaging","sourcePdf":"t1591634.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06125S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7272171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7272171","articleId":"7272462","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7272464,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Mer\u010dep","affiliation":["iThera Medical GmbH, Munich, Germany","Helmholtz Center Munich, Institute for Biological and Medical Imaging (IBMI), Neuherberg","Faculty of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7272171/7272464/7272464-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Elena Mercep is currently employed as an R&D engineer at iThera Medical, where she works on development and integration of algorithms for multispectral optoacoustic tomography and ultrasound imaging.

However, the fundamentally different physical contrast mechanisms of the two modalities may impose significant difficulties in the optimal tomographic data acquisition and image formation strategies. We investigate the applicability of the commonly applied imaging geometries for acquisition and reconstruction of hybrid optoacoustic tomography and pulse-echo ultrasound (OPUS) images. Optimization of the ultrasound image formation strategy using concave array geometry was implemented using a synthetic aperture method combined with spatial compounding. Experimental validation was performed using a custom-made multiplexer unit executing switching between the two modalities employing the same transducer array. A variety of array probes with different angular coverages were subsequently tested, including arrays for clinical hand-held imaging as well as stationary arrays for tomographic small animal imaging. The results demonstrate that acquisition of OAT data by mere addition of an illumination source to the common US linear array geometry may result in significant limited-view artifacts and overall loss of image quality. On the other hand, unsatisfactory US image quality is achieved with tomographic arrays solely optimized for OAT image acquisition without considering the optimal transmit-receive beamforming parameters. Optimal selection of the array pitch size, tomographic coverage and spatial compounding parameters has achieved here an accurate hybrid imaging performance, which was experimentally showcased in tissuemimicking phantoms, post-mortem mice, and hand-held imaging of a healthy volunteer. The efficient combination of the two modalities in a single imaging device reveals the true power of functional and molecular imaging capacities of OAT in addition to the morphological and functional imaging capabilities of US.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15474836","htmlLink":"/document/7272464/","pubMedId":"26415127","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid optoacoustic tomography and pulse-echo ultrasonography using concave arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid optoacoustic tomography and pulse-echo ultrasonography using concave arrays","sourcePdf":"t1591651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116815S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7272171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7272171","articleId":"7272464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7272585,"authors":[{"name":"Ryuya Akase","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University"],"firstName":"Ryuya","lastName":"Akase","id":"38466530800"},{"name":"Yoshihiro Okada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Okada","id":"37276752700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7568-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7567-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0138"}],"articleNumber":"7272585","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Genetic algorithms","Correlation","Optimization","Clouds","Three-dimensional displays","Fasteners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","genetic algorithms","Internet","pattern classification","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web based time-tunnel","interactive multidimensional data visualization tool","genetic algorithm","visualization system","3D charts","time series multidimensional data","Web browser","data classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-tunnel","Web based visualization tool","Time series data","Multidimensional data","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272585","abstract":"This paper presents a Web based Time-tunnel, a visualization system that renders 3D charts of time series multidimensional data in a web browser.

These functions are crucial for the quality of discussions and can benefit from information visualization. To do this, we propose a classification of navigational moves and attitudes and their visual representation in form of \"Navicons\" and \"Atticons\".

The main goal is to handle the consumer demand for customized products. Recent developments in research, engineering and technology enable industries to move from profitable linear assembly lines to profitable non-linear, dynamic assembly lines to satisfy such a demand. Industry 4.0, a German governmental initiative, encourages industries to use interconnected Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to create context-sensitive and decentralized factory environments. CPSs in combination with tracking technologies and a component based assembly line can create a factory environment that allows customers to change their requirements during assembly-time. Such change is typically not considered in the domain of manufacturing. In modern software engineering projects, agile techniques allow customer change during the entire development phase. Such change results in customer oriented, customized software products. In this paper we describe the development of an Agile Factory prototype. The developed Agile Factory prototype transfers agile software engineering techniques to the domain of manufacturing. It explores the impact and feasibility of customer changes during assembly-time using a commercially available software framework. The assembly line of the Agile Factory is component based, using track able mobile worktables in combination with stationary workstations. Therefore, each product with its associated request is track able during assembly-time which enables us to implement a customer feedback loop. The feedback loop allows change requests during assembly-time. Without the integration of such tracking techniques a customer feedback loop is very difficult up to impossible to implement. We created a Cyber-Physical Human System (CPHS) using smart factory-hardware in combination with an accepted manufacturing software framework. We bridge the virtual and physical world enabling the customer and the factory worker to communicate with actual physical objects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7272683/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15473909","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Agile Factory - An Example of an Industry 4.0 Manufacturing Process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agile Factory - An Example of an Industry 4.0 Manufacturing Process","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"7785a043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046038S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7271128","isNumber":"7272665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7271128","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7272665","articleId":"7272683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7272684,"authors":[{"name":"Abraham Monrroy","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Monrroy","id":"37085721173"},{"name":"Manato Hirabayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Manato","lastName":"Hirabayashi","id":"37085500969"},{"name":"Shinpei Kato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinpei","lastName":"Kato","id":"37085381239"},{"name":"Masato Edahiro","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Edahiro","id":"37085681996"},{"name":"Takefumi Miyoshi","affiliation":["E-trees.Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takefumi","lastName":"Miyoshi","id":"37085733984"},{"name":"Satoshi Funada","affiliation":["E-trees.Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Funada","id":"37085724535"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7785-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7784-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7272684","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hexa Cam: An FPGA-Based Multi-view Camera System","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, Networks, and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7271128/7272665/07272684.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, Networks, and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPSNA.2015.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272665","doi":"10.1109/CPSNA.2015.18","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Field programmable gate arrays","Ports (Computers)","Prototypes","Graphics processing units","Robot vision systems","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","field programmable gate arrays","graphics processing units","image sensors","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HexaCam","multiview camera system","perception information","cyberphysical system","autonomous robotics","decision-making","self-localization","image sensor","custom built FPGA board","HOG based object detector","GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Object Detection","Perception","GPU","Real-Time","Camera sensor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272684","abstract":"Accurate perception information of the surroundings is a desirable feature in any cyber-physical system for autonomous robotics.

Our conclusion is that the low cost prototype is able to acquire and extract the perception data in 9.41 frames per second.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15473913","htmlLink":"/document/7272684/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hexa Cam: An FPGA-Based Multi-view Camera System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hexa Cam: An FPGA-Based Multi-view Camera System","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"7785a048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070823S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7271128","isNumber":"7272665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7271128","xplore-issue":"7272665","articleId":"7272684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272690,"authors":[{"name":"Prathap Kumar Valsan","affiliation":["University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas"],"firstName":"Prathap Kumar","lastName":"Valsan","id":"37085686679"},{"name":"Heechul Yun","affiliation":["University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas"],"firstName":"Heechul","lastName":"Yun","id":"37085424702"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7785-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7784-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7272690","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"abstract":"Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) DRAM controllers are optimized for high memory throughput, but they do not provide predictable timing among memory requests from different cores in multicore systems. Therefore, memory requests from a critical real-time task on one core can be substantially delayed by memory requests from on-real-time tasks on the other cores. In this work, we propose a DRAM controller design, called MEDUSA, to provide predictable memory performance in multicore based real-time systems. MEDUSA can provide high time predictability when needed for real-time tasks but also strive to provide high average performance for non-real-time tasks through a close collaboration between the OSand the DRAM controller. In our approach, the OS partially partitions DRAM banks into two groups: reserved banks and shared banks. The reserved banks are exclusive to each core to provide predictable timing while the shared banks are shared by all cores to efficiently utilize the resources. MEDUSA has two separate queues for read and write requests, and it prioritizes reads over writes. In processing read requests, MEDUSA employs a two-level scheduling algorithm that prioritizes the memory requests to the reserved banks in a Round Robin fashion to provide strong timing predictability. In processing write requests, MEDUSA largely relies on the FR-FCFS for high throughput but makes an immediate switch to read upon arrival of read requests to the reserved banks. We implemented MEDUSA in a Gem5 full-system simulator and a Linux kernel and performed experiments using a set of synthetic and SPEC2006 benchmarks to analyze the performance impact of MEDUSA on both real-time and non-real-time tasks. The results show that MEDUSA achieves up to 95% better worst-case performance for real-time tasks while achieving up to 31% throughput improvement for non-real-time tasks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Real-time systems","Delays","Multicore processing","Benchmark testing","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","embedded systems","multiprocessing systems","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEDUSA","high-performance DRAM controller","multicore based embedded system","commercial-off-the-shelf DRAM controller","COTS DRAM controller","high memory throughput","memory request","multicore system","DRAM controller design","predictable memory performance","multicore based real-time system","high time predictability","reserved bank","shared bank","two-level scheduling algorithm","Round Robin fashion","timing predictability","FR-FCFS","read upon arrival","read requests","Gem5 full-system simulator","Linux kernel","performed experiments","SPEC2006 benchmark"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272690","doi":"10.1109/CPSNA.2015.24","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, Networks, and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7271128/7272665/07272690.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPSNA.2015.24","startPage":"86","endPage":"93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272665","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, Networks, and Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MEDUSA: A Predictable and High-Performance DRAM Controller for Multicore Based Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MEDUSA: A Predictable and High-Performance DRAM Controller for Multicore Based Embedded Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272690/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272690/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15473907","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MEDUSA: A Predictable and High-Performance DRAM Controller for Multicore Based Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"7785a086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062745S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7271128","isNumber":"7272665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7271128","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7272665","articleId":"7272690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7272695,"authors":[{"name":"John J.

I describe how the emergent computational dynamics of a biologically based neural network generates a robust natural solution to the problem of categorizing time-varying stimulus patterns such as spoken words or animal stereotypical behaviors. The recognition of these patterns is made difficult by their substantial variation in cadence and duration. The neural circuit behaviors used are similar to those associated with brain neural integrators. In the larger context described here, this kind of circuit becomes a building block of an entirely different computational algorithm for solving complex problems. While the network behavior is simulated in detail, a collective view is essential to understanding the results. A closed equation of motion for the collective variable describes an algorithm that quantitatively accounts for many aspects of the emergent network computation. The feedback connections and ongoing activity in the network shape the collective dynamics onto a reduced dimensionality manifold of activity space, which defines the algorithm and computation actually performed. The external inputs are weak and are not the dominant drivers of network activity.</para>","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00768","startPage":"2011","endPage":"2038","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/7272693/07272695.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Emergent Dynamics: Using a Collective Activity Coordinate of a Neural Network to Recognize Time-Varying Patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Emergent Dynamics: Using a Collective Activity Coordinate of a Neural Network to Recognize Time-Varying Patterns","volume":"27","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Emergent Dynamics: Using a Collective Activity Coordinate of a Neural Network to Recognize Time-Varying Patterns","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024179S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","isNumber":"7272693","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7272695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272701,"authors":[{"name":"Predrag S.

Furthermore, the multi-location thermal monitoring function has been experimentally demonstrated and a 1.8 \u00b0C/mm on-chip temperature gradient was detected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272773/","volume":"62","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7272773/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15484904","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 0.7 V Relative Temperature Sensor With a Non-Calibrated <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\pm 1~^{\\circ}{\\rm C}$</tex></formula> 3<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\sigma$</tex></formula> Relative Inaccuracy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.7 V Relative Temperature Sensor With a Non-Calibrated <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\pm 1~^{\\circ}{\\rm C}$</tex></formula> 3<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\sigma$</tex></formula> Relative Inaccuracy","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lu-2471555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116122S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7277125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7277125","articleId":"7272773","onlineDate":"21 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7272774,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Yu Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7277125/7272774/7272774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai-Yu Hu received his B.S. degree from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2015, where he is currently working toward his M.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering.","His research interests include fast transient dc\u2014dc converters and power IC design."]},"firstName":"Kai-Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085625187"},{"name":"Shih-Mei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7277125/7272774/7272774-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-Mei Lin received the B.S. and the M.S degrees from the department of Electronic Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.","She is currently working as an Analog IC Design Engineer, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

A layered non-resetting IDD technique is used to minimize the number of inner iterations for a required error performance. An area-efficient minimum mean-square error with parallel interference cancellation (MMSE-PIC) detector is devised to simplify matrix inversion. A detector-decoder interface that is used to exchange soft messages efficiently is proposed. Given the throughput specifications, inner and outer loops are optimally combined to maximize the error performance. The design specifications defined in the IEEE 802.11n standard are adopted as the design target. A 4 \u00d7 4 antenna configuration with BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM modulations are realized in silicon.

Two algorithms result: one nearly identical to joint integrated probabilistic data association (JIPDA), and another related to the multiple target multi-Bernoulli (MeMBer) filter.

By introducing 0-1 control variables to original features in the input space, sparse feature selection for anomaly detection is modeled as a mixed integer programming problem. Due to the prohibitively high computational complexity, it is relaxed into a quadratically constrained linear programming (QCLP) problem. The QCLP problem can then be practically solved by using an iterative optimization method, in which multiple subsets of features are iteratively found as opposed to a single subset. However, when a nonlinear kernel such as Gaussian radial basis function kernel, associated with an infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is used in the QCLP-based iterative optimization, it is impractical to find optimal subsets of features due to a large number of possible combinations of the original features. To tackle this issue, a feature map called the empirical kernel map, which maps data points in the input space into a finite space called the empirical kernel feature space (EKFS), is used in the proposed work. The QCLP-based iterative optimization problem is solved in the EKFS instead of in the input space or the RKHS. This is possible because the geometrical properties of the EKFS and the corresponding RKHS remain the same. Now, an explicit nonlinear exploitation of the data in a finite EKFS is achievable, which results in optimal feature ranking. Comprehensive experimental results on three hyperspectral images and several machine learning datasets show that our proposed method can provide improved performance over the current state-of-the-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.130730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272823.pdf","startPage":"1698","endPage":"1716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.130730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse kernel learning-based feature selection for anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272823/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse kernel learning-based feature selection for anomaly detection","volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15484876","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272823/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse kernel learning-based feature selection for anomaly detection","sourcePdf":"09-itae-51-3-1698.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123297S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272825,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-hong Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7272811/7272825/7272825-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sang-Hong Park received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2004, 2007, and 2010, respectively.

Based on the data it receives from multiple antennas, the fusion center formulates a matrix, referred to as the data matrix, which, via standard array processing schemes leads to target detection and parameter estimation. In this paper, it is shown that under certain conditions, the data matrix is low rank and thus can be recovered based on knowledge of a small subset of its entries via matrix completion (MC) techniques. Leveraging the low-rank property of the data matrix, we propose a new MIMO radar approach, termed, MIMO-MC radar, in which each receive node either performs matched filtering with a small number of randomly selected dictionary waveforms or obtains sub-Nyquist samples of the target returns at random sampling instants, and forwards the results to a fusion center. Based on the received samples, and with knowledge of the sampling scheme, the fusion center partially fills the data matrix and subsequently applies MC techniques to estimate the full matrix. MIMO-MC radars share the advantages of MIMO radars with compressive sensing, (MIMO-CS), i.e., high resolution with reduced amounts of data, but unlike MIMO-CS radars do not require grid discretization. The MIMO-MC radar concept is illustrated through a uniform linear array configuration, and its target estimation performance is demonstrated via simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.140452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272834.pdf","startPage":"1839","endPage":"1852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.140452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-MC radar: A MIMO radar approach based on matrix completion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272834/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-MC radar: A MIMO radar approach based on matrix completion","volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15484881","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272834/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-MC radar: A MIMO radar approach based on matrix completion","sourcePdf":"20-itae-51-3-1839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109202S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272838,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-qi Wu","affiliation":["East China Research Institute of Electronic Engineering, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7272811/7272838/7272838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wu Jianqi was born in Yibin, Sichuan, China, in 1966.

This correlation degrades the performance of the low-angle direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in multipath conditions. By making use of the sparsity of the targets, after filtering out the clutter in the Doppler dimension, two DOA estimation approaches based on compressed sensing (CS) are proposed. The interpolated array- (IA-) CS and beamspace- (BS-) CS perform compressive sampling, respectively, on an IA and in the BS. The proposed methods are different from subspace-based methods in concept and are not subject to the restricting requirements of spatial and temporal stationarities, as well as the correlation between the sources and noise. Both simulated and measured results verify that the proposed methods provide superior performance in resolving the DOAs as compared with the spatial CS method and other conventional DOA methods.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.130841","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272838.pdf","startPage":"1891","endPage":"1900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.130841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing techniques for altitude estimation in multipath conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272838/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing techniques for altitude estimation in multipath conditions","volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15475177","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272838/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing techniques for altitude estimation in multipath conditions","sourcePdf":"24-itae-51-3-1891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087823S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272839,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando G.

To determine the presence of a target, traditional radar detection compares the observed SNR at samples of the matched filter output to a specified threshold. However, sample rates often used in practice result in two or more adjacent samples with target energy. Therefore, traditional radar detection ignores a key piece of information - the correlation between samples. Using an explicit model of adjacent matched filter samples and the functional form of the matched filter response, the average log likelihood ratio test (ALLRT) is derived assuming a Rayleigh target with pulse-to-pulse fluctuations. Furthermore, key features relevant to the design of a detector are investigated. In particular, the ALLRT detector provides robustness against the negative effects of range bin straddling, and in some cases outperforms traditional detectors that use oversampled matched filter outputs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272841/","volume":"51","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7272841/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15484854","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detection of rayleigh targets using adjacent matched filter samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of rayleigh targets using adjacent matched filter samples","sourcePdf":"27-itae-51-3-1927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117217S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7272844,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Fellows","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Baylor University, Waco, TX"],"bio":{"p":["Matthew Fellows completed his bachelor and master of science degrees in electrical and computer engineering at Baylor University in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

For range radars, better range resolution can be accomplished by using waveforms of higher bandwidth. In this case it is desirable to maximize the chirp waveform bandwidth while maintaining spectral compliance and meeting power-added efficiency requirements. Based on the concept of the Smith Tube (presented in a recent conference article), this article describes a new intelligent, vector-based search for the load impedance and waveform bandwidth.

A digital very-large-scale integration architecture is proposed for beam-enhanced linear aperture arrays. The proposed architecture consists of four subsystems: 2-D IIR prefiltering, beam steering via fast computation of filter coefficients, compensation for nonlinear phase, and phased/timed-array beamforming. Systolic-array architectures are used for first- and second-order 2-D IIR prefiltering subsystems, including fast computation of filter coefficients. The trade-off due to the nonlinear phase response of the 2-D IIR prefilter is partially compensated via fast Fourier transform-based complex phase rotations. Designs are implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T field-programmable gate-array device and verified using on-chip hardware cosimulation. Field-programmable gate-array designs for both 2-D IIR prefiltering and filter coefficient computation are mapped to standard-cell application-specific integrated circuits in 45 nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology up to the synthesis level with supply VDC = 1.1 V. For a simulation having 64 antennas with binary phase-shift keying modulation, the beam-enhanced aperture array provides better than 10 dB improvement in bit error rate versus signal-to-interference ratio performance compared to phased/timed-array beamforming.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.140507","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272847.pdf","startPage":"1996","endPage":"2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.140507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital VLSI architectures for beam-enhanced RF aperture arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Digital VLSI architectures for beam-enhanced RF aperture arrays","volume":"51","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475193","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272847/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272847/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital VLSI architectures for beam-enhanced RF aperture arrays","sourcePdf":"33-itae-51-3-1996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191368S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272847","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7272851,"authors":[{"name":"Frankie K.W.

Unavailable randomly positioned samples can result from heavily corrupted parts of the signal. Because these samples can be omitted and declared as unavailable, the application of the compressive sensing methods in the recovery of heavily corrupted signal and radar images is possible. A simple direct method for the recovery of unavailable signal samples and the calculation of the restored ISAR image is reviewed. An analysis of the noise influence is performed. For fast-maneuvering ISAR targets, the sparsity property is lost because the ISAR image is blurred. A nonparametric quadratic time-frequency representation-based method is used to restore the ISAR image sparsity. However, the linear relation between the signal and the sparsity domain transformation is lost. A recently proposed gradient recovery algorithm is adapted for this kind of analysis. It does not require a linear relation of the signal and its sparsity domain transformation in the process of unavailable data recovery. The presented methods and results are tested on several examples proving the expected accuracy and improvements.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.140413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272854.pdf","startPage":"2093","endPage":"2106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.140413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISAR image analysis and recovery with unavailable or heavily corrupted data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272854/","displayDocTitle":"ISAR image analysis and recovery with unavailable or heavily corrupted data","volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15475176","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272854/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISAR image analysis and recovery with unavailable or heavily corrupted data","sourcePdf":"40-itae-51-3-2093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084892S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7272855,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-he Cao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7272811/7272855/7272855-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun-He Cao was born in Anhui, China, in 1978.

However, television broadcast-transmitted signals offer poor range resolution for imaging purposes, because they have a narrower bandwidth with respect to those transmitted by a dedicated ISAR system. To reach finer range resolutions, signals composed of multiple DVB-T channels are required. Problems arise, however, because DVB-T channels are typically widely separated in the frequency domain. The gaps between channels produce high grating lobes in the image domain when Fourier-based algorithms are used to form the ISAR image. In this paper, compressive sensing theory is investigated to address this problem because of its ability to reconstruct sparse signals by using incomplete measures. By solving an optimization problem under the constraint of signal sparsity, passive ISAR images can be obtained with strongly reduced grating lobes. Both simulation and experimental results are shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing\u2013based algorithm for passive bistatic ISAR with DVB-T signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.130761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272859.pdf","startPage":"2166","endPage":"2180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.130761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing\u2013based algorithm for passive bistatic ISAR with DVB-T signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7272859/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15484848","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing\u2013based algorithm for passive bistatic ISAR with DVB-T signals","sourcePdf":"45-itae-51-3-2166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125595S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7272865,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ding","affiliation":["Institute of Optical Instrument and System, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, P.

A sparse imaging algorithm taking into account the perturbation due to carrier offsets is also proposed, which improves upon the OMP algorithm.

The orthogonality is not affected by time delays from transmitters. Thus, our proposed MIMO OFDM radar has the same range resolution as single transmitter radar and achieves full spatial diversity. Orthogonal designs are used to achieve this orthogonality across the transmitters, with which it is only needed to design OFDM pulses for the first transmitter. We also propose a joint pulse compression and pulse coherent integration for range reconstruction. In order to achieve the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the range reconstruction, we apply the paraunitary filterbank theory to design the OFDM pulses. We then propose a modified iterative clipping and filtering (MICF) algorithm for the designs of OFDM pulses jointly, when other important factors, such as peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in time domain, are also considered.With our proposed MIMO OFDM radar, there is no interference for the range reconstruction not only across the transmitters but also across the range cells in a swath called inter-range-cell interference (IRCI) free that is similar to our previously proposed CP-based OFDM radar for single transmitter. Simulations are presented to illustrate our proposed theory and show that the CP-based MIMO OFDM radar outperforms the existing frequency-band shared MIMO radar with polyphase codes and also frequency division MIMO radar.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.140477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272868.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.140477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO OFDM radar IRCI free range reconstruction with sufficient cyclic prefix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO OFDM radar IRCI free range reconstruction with sufficient cyclic prefix","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15484859","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7272868/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO OFDM radar IRCI free range reconstruction with sufficient cyclic prefix","sourcePdf":"54-itae-51-3-2276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124757S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272869,"authors":[{"name":"Menglan Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7272811/7272869/7272869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Menglan Hu received the B.E. degree in electronic and information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China (2007), and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore (2012).

To address the problem, a novel scheduling algorithm called synchronized highest level first (SHLF) algorithm is presented. Moreover, to further improve schedulability, this paper also proposes two rescheduling and backtracking approaches, namely release time deferment (RTD) procedure and backtracking and priority promotion (BPP) procedure.

The proposed multiloop controller operates over a network of sensors. Each sensor corresponds to one of the control loops and is dedicated to sampling the attitude, the velocity, or the position of the quadrotor. The sensors operate at different sampling frequencies that are assumed to be lower bounded. The control signals in each loop are computed at different rates, which are dictated by the corresponding sensor of the control loop. Two formal results are proved. Given the controller gains, the first result provides sufficient conditions for finding the lowest allowable sampling frequency for each control loop such that stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The second result provides a controller synthesis algorithm and sufficient conditions guaranteeing the stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed multiloop controller when compared to the single-loop, single-rate case. In particular, the results show that increasing the sampling frequency of a control loop allows a designer to decrease the sampling frequency of the other control loops below the limit imposed by the single-rate case. Using the technique proposed in this paper, an engineer can thus select the proper combination of sampling frequencies for a specific application, based on the price, availability, performance, power requirements, weight, maintenance costs, and other characteristics of the sensors.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.140331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.140331","startPage":"2319","endPage":"2331","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272871.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiloop controller design for a fly-by-wireless UAV quadrotor based on a multirate sampled-data model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multiloop controller design for a fly-by-wireless UAV quadrotor based on a multirate sampled-data model","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","volume":"51","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272871/","accessionNumber":"15475190","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272871/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiloop controller design for a fly-by-wireless UAV quadrotor based on a multirate sampled-data model","sourcePdf":"57-itae-51-3-2319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080925S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7272872,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Chen","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, College of Information Engineering, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7272811/7272872/7272872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Chen received a B.S. degree in information and computing science from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, Ganzhou, China, in 2008, and a Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, in 2014.","He is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the College of Science and Engineering, City University of Hong Kong.

A novel model is proposed to describe the random observation delays and packet dropouts, and a robust optimal fusion filter for the addressed networked multisensor fusion systems is designed using the innovation analysis method. The dimension of the designed filter is the same as that of the original system, which helps to reduce computation cost compared with the augmentation method. Moreover, robust reduced-dimension observation-fusion Kalman filters are proposed to further reduce the computation burden. Note that the designed fusion filter gain matrices can be computed off-line, as they depend only on the upper bounds of random delays and on the occurrence probabilities of delays and sensor failures. Some sufficient conditions are presented for stability and optimality of the designed fusion filters, and a steady-state fusion filter is also given for the networked multisensor fusion systems. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed fusion filters.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.130803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272872.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.130803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","startPage":"2232","endPage":"2249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Networked fusion kalman filtering with multiple uncertainties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Networked fusion kalman filtering with multiple uncertainties","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272872/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15475180","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7272872/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Networked fusion kalman filtering with multiple uncertainties","sourcePdf":"58-itae-51-3-2332.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.186302S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7272874,"authors":[{"name":"Yogesh Nijsure","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de g\u00e9nie \u00e9lectrique, \u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7272811/7272874/7272874-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yogesh Anil Nijsure received his B.E. degree (distinction) in electronics engineering from the University of Mumbai, India, in June 2006 and his M.Sc. degree (distinction, rank 1) in wireless communication systems engineering from the University of Greenwich, United Kingdom, in September 2008.

First, a basic fault-tolerant controller is proposed to accommodate actuator faults or failures and guarantee local finite-time stability. When there is no a priori knowledge of actuator faults, disturbances, and inertia uncertainties, an online adaptive law is proposed to estimate the bounds of these uncertainties, and local finite-time convergence is achieved by an adaptive fault-tolerant controller. In addition, another adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme is derived that explicitly takes into account the actuator saturation. The proposed attitude controller provides fault-tolerant capability despite control input saturation and ensures that attitude and angular velocity converge to a neighborhood of the origin in finite time. Finally, simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-time fault-tolerant attitude stabilization for spacecraft with actuator saturation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2015.130725","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7272811/07272876.pdf","startPage":"2390","endPage":"2405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2015.130725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272876/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Finite-time fault-tolerant attitude stabilization for spacecraft with actuator saturation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7272876/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15484870","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-time fault-tolerant attitude stabilization for spacecraft with actuator saturation","sourcePdf":"62-itae-51-3-2390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124772S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7272811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"7272811","articleId":"7272876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7272882,"authors":[{"name":"Weijian Liu","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Weijian","lastName":"Liu","id":"38240032500"},{"name":"Yongliang Wang","affiliation":["Wuhan Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yongliang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293643900"},{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598328500"},{"name":"Wenchong Xie","affiliation":["Wuhan Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenchong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37288309100"},{"name":"Hui Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37560130900"},{"name":"Wenkun Gu","affiliation":["Wuhan Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenkun","lastName":"Gu","id":"37085347316"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"7272882","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":640},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Detectors","Radar antennas","Covariance matrices","Maximum likelihood estimation","Clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","MIMO radar","object detection","probability","radar detection","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive detection","colocated MIMO radar target detection","colocated multiple-input multiple-output radar target detection","colored noise","Rao and Wald test criteria","constant false alarm rate probability","matched filtering","statistical distribution"]}],"abstract":"For colocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar target detection in colored noise, we propose two adaptive detectors according to the Rao and Wald test criteria.

Change-level defect prediction, which is also referred as just-in-time defect prediction, could not only ensure software quality in the development process, but also make the developers check and fix the defects in time. Nowadays, deep learning is a hot topic in the machine learning literature. Whether deep learning can be used to improve the performance of just-in-time defect prediction is still uninvestigated. In this paper, to bridge this research gap, we propose an approach Deeper which leverages deep learning techniques to predict defect-prone changes. We first build a set of expressive features from a set of initial change features by leveraging a deep belief network algorithm. Next, a machine learning classifier is built on the selected features. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we use datasets from six large open source projects, i.e., Bugzilla, Columba, JDT, Platform, Mozilla, and PostgreSQL, containing a total of 137,417 changes. We compare our approach with the approach proposed by Kamei et al. The experimental results show that on average across the 6 projects, Deeper could discover 32.22% more bugs than Kamei et al's approach (51.04% versus 18.82% on average). In addition, Deeper can achieve F1-scores of 0.22-0.63, which are statistically significantly higher than those of Kamei et al.'s approach on 4 out of the 6 projects.","doi":"10.1109/QRS.2015.14","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/7268779/7272893/07272910.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS.2015.14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Just-in-Time Defect Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Just-in-Time Defect Prediction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272910/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475909","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272910/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for Just-in-Time Defect Prediction","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"7989a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1092S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7268779","isNumber":"7272893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7268779","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"7272893","articleId":"7272910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7272913,"authors":[{"name":"Fangyun Qin","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fangyun","lastName":"Qin","id":"37085761083"},{"name":"Zheng Zheng","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37292753300"},{"name":"Chenggang Bai","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenggang","lastName":"Bai","id":"37551111300"},{"name":"Yu Qiao","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37085763698"},{"name":"Zhenyu Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Software Chinese, Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292205300"},{"name":"Cheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085507804"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7989-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7988-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7272913","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","Software","Measurement","Training","Testing","Learning systems","Computer bugs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","program debugging","program testing","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-project aging","software performance degradation","software failure rate","software execution","software aging","aging related bugs","software testing","low presence probability","transfer learning based aging related bug prediction approach","TLAP","data variance","class imbalance learning","machine learning method","software system","ARB bug prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["aging related bug","ross-project","bug prediction","software aging","transfer learning"]}],"abstract":"In a long running system, software tends to encounter performance degradation and increasing failure rate during execution, which is called software aging. The bugs contributing to the phenomenon of software aging are defined as Aging Related Bugs (ARBs). Lots of manpower and economic costs will be saved if ARBs can be found in the testing phase. However, due to the low presence probability and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, it is usually hard to predict ARBs within a project. In this paper, we study whether and how ARBs can be located through cross-project prediction. We propose a transfer learning based aging related bug prediction approach (TLAP), which takes advantage of transfer learning to reduce the distribution difference between training sets and testing sets while preserving their data variance. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the severe class imbalance, class imbalance learning is conducted on the transferred latent space. Finally, we employ machine learning methods to handle the bug prediction tasks. The effectiveness of our approach is validated and evaluated by experiments on two real software systems. It indicates that after the processing of TLAP, the performance of ARB bug prediction can be dramatically improved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Project Aging Related Bug Prediction","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security","doi":"10.1109/QRS.2015.17","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/7268779/7272893/07272913.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS.2015.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Project Aging Related Bug Prediction","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272913/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15475908","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Project Aging Related Bug Prediction","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"7989a043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07188S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7268779","isNumber":"7272893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7268779","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7272893","articleId":"7272913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272919,"authors":[{"name":"Anneliese Andrews","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science University of Denver, Denver, Colorado"],"firstName":"Anneliese","lastName":"Andrews","id":"37272050800"},{"name":"Joseph Lucente","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science University of Denver, Denver, Colorado"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Lucente","id":"37085489317"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7989-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7988-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7272919","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"abstract":"In this case study we investigate software reliability models and their applicability to process improvement at an IT help desk.

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy. We show the effectiveness of PBC when applying it to a large dataset.","doi":"10.1109/QRS.2015.25","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/7268779/7272893/07272921.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS.2015.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anomaly Detection System Based on Ensemble of Detectors with Effective Pruning Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272921/","displayDocTitle":"An Anomaly Detection System Based on Ensemble of Detectors with Effective Pruning Techniques","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15475887","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7272921/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anomaly Detection System Based on Ensemble of Detectors with Effective Pruning Techniques","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"7989a109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095283S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7268779","isNumber":"7272893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7268779","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7272893","articleId":"7272921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7272945,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085725974"},{"name":"Yaming Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yaming","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085732328"},{"name":"Yibiao Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yibiao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085391626"},{"name":"Hongmin Lu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongmin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37533925000"},{"name":"Yuming Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37629464300"},{"name":"Baowen Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Baowen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37276983200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7989-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7988-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7272945","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Computer bugs","Standards","Context","Measurement","Software","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","Java","learning (artificial intelligence)","program debugging","public domain software","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning-to-rank","software bug localization","software debugging","recommended files","open-source Java projects","VSM","vector space model","IR-based bug localization approach","information retrieval"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bug localization","bug reports","effort-aware","learning-to-rank","empirical study"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272945","doi":"10.1109/QRS.2015.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS.2015.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272893","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/7268779/7272893/07272945.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Is Learning-to-Rank Cost-Effective in Recommending Relevant Files for Bug Localization?","abstract":"Software bug localization aiming to determine the locations needed to be fixed for a bug report is one of the most tedious and effort consuming activities in software debugging. Learning-to-rank (LR) is the state-of-the-art approach proposed by Ye et al. to recommending relevant files for bug localization. Ye et al.'s experimental results show that the LR approach significantly outperforms previous bug localization approaches in terms of \"precision\" and \"accuracy\". However, this evaluation does not take into account the influence of the size of the recommended files on the efficiency in detecting bugs. In practice, developers will generally spend more code inspection effort to detect bugs if larger files are recommended. In this paper, we use six large-scale open-source Java projects to evaluate the LR approach in the context of effort-aware bug localization. Our results, surprisingly, show that, when taking into account the code inspection effort to detect bugs, the LR approach is similar to or even worse than the standard VSM (Vector Space Model), a na\u00efve IR-based bug localization approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7272945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7272945/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15475889","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Is Learning-to-Rank Cost-Effective in Recommending Relevant Files for Bug Localization?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is Learning-to-Rank Cost-Effective in Recommending Relevant Files for Bug Localization?","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"7989a298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06603S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7268779","isNumber":"7272893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7268779","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7272893","articleId":"7272945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7273034,"authors":[{"name":"James V.

technological topic changes in patent claims","abstract":"Patent claims usually embody the most essential terms and the core technological scope to define the protection of an invention, which makes them the ideal resource for patent content and topic change analysis. However, manually conducting content analysis on massive technical terms is very time consuming and laborious. Even with the help of traditional text mining techniques, it is still difficult to model topic changes over time, because single keywords alone are usually too general or ambiguous to represent a concept. Moreover, term frequency which used to define a topic cannot separate polysemous words that are actually describing a different theme. To address this issue, this research proposes a topic change identification approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation to model and analyze topic changes with minimal human intervention. After textual data cleaning, underlying semantic topics hidden in large archives of patent claims are revealed automatically. Concepts are defined by probability distributions over words instead of term frequency, so that polysemy is allowed. A case study using patents published in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 2009 to 2013 with Australia as their assignee country is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed topic change identification approach. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach can be used as an automatic tool to provide machine-identified topic changes for more efficient and effective R&D management assistance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273098/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15486580","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273098/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling technological topic changes in patent claims","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling technological topic changes in patent claims","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"15R0096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119463S","chronDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259601","isNumber":"7272950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259601","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7272950","articleId":"7273098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7273103,"authors":[{"name":"Maicon G.

It has demonstrated potential to support the development of strategies and plans concerning product and technology innovations for businesses and industrial sectors. Plenty of knowledge with regard to the best practices for implementing the roadmapping approach has been reported, however they are mainly focused on the roadmapping implementation. In fact, there is little information available focusing at enhancing the roadmapping performance to an upper level in organizations that have already mastered its implementation. To this end, this paper proposes a framework to improve the roadmapping performance based on its most core result, the roadmap. The framework uses three indicators of roadmapping performance: information gathering, layers integration and forecasting. These indicators work as references for examining roadmaps created in the organization, clarifying eventual limitations in the implemented process. Aiming at enriching the roadmapping performance, the framework recommends different methods and tools to tackle the aforementioned indicators. Examples of published roadmaps are used to analyse the potential of the proposed framework as a roadmapping improvement tool.","doi":"10.1109/PICMET.2015.7273103","publicationTitle":"2015 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259601/7272950/07273103.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICMET.2015.7273103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272950","startPage":"2255","endPage":"2263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for improving the roadmapping performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A framework for improving the roadmapping performance","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273103/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486494","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273103/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for improving the roadmapping performance","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"15R0104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101828S","chronDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259601","isNumber":"7272950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259601","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7272950","articleId":"7273103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7273134,"authors":[{"name":"Siong Kiat Chan","affiliation":["Graduate School of Innovation Management, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Siong Kiat","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085753114"},{"name":"Kumiko Miyazaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Innovation Management, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kumiko","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"37085421345"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-8908-4331-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-8908-4332-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-5100"}],"articleNumber":"7273134","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Cloud computing","Industries","Big data","Technological innovation","Business","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge convergence","Big Data","Malaysia","technological opportunity analysis","ICT sector","keyword co-occurrence analysis","scientific publications","cloud computing service sector","cloud service providers"]}],"abstract":"Convergence essentially can be defined as at least two discernible entities moving toward union and is prominent in the ICT sector where combinations of different products and services have resulted in many meaningful innovations.

The model includes: 1) motivations for organizations to participate in the development of an ITR, 2) industry-related motivations for developing a roadmap, 3) stakeholder-based structure and processes used to create the roadmap, 4) characteristics of the roadmap document, 5) industry clockspeed (pace of change), and 6) organizational impacts from ITR development (e.g. technology planning, pace of innovation, collaborative activities and partnering, implementation of new technologies, etc.). A survey instrument was administered to participants (N=128) involved with six different industry technology roadmapping exercises: concrete, electronics, forest products, magnesium, metal casting, and powder metallurgy industries. This paper summarizes the feedback from ITR development organizational participants regarding six open-ended questions, and makes some conclusions about what characteristics determine whether a roadmap experiences future iterations or is left as a one-time exercise in an industry.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology

Many papers anticipated a rocky road for IT system integration into power system and suggested the cloud computing adoption as a smart grid IT infrastructure to smooth the integration. Though cloud computing could overcome some of these integration challenges, it would bring some of its own. This study intends to give more insight to decision makers or utility companies to make a better decision whether to adopt cloud computing with regards to their needs or not. In the problem statement section is explained why the current approach to define advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing from selective point of views is not enough and might not be accurate, and a comprehensive assessment is required. The proposed multi-perspective framework takes all the criteria that would affect the assessment of cloud computing and put them into organizational, technical, economical, social and political categories. This framework would guide players in smart grid to better define benefits and challenges of cloud computing according to their needs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comprehensive assessment of cloud computing for smart grid applications: A multi-perspectives framework","publicationTitle":"2015 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET)","doi":"10.1109/PICMET.2015.7273227","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259601/7272950/07273227.pdf","startPage":"2541","endPage":"2547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICMET.2015.7273227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive assessment of cloud computing for smart grid applications: A multi-perspectives framework","conferenceDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273227/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486492","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive assessment of cloud computing for smart grid applications: A multi-perspectives framework","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"15R0435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120377S","chronDate":"2-6 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259601","isNumber":"7272950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259601","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7272950","articleId":"7273227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7273323,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Ritsumeikan University Kusatsu-shi, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085678332"},{"name":"Tetsutaro Uehara","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Ritsumeikan University Kusatsu-shi, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsutaro","lastName":"Uehara","id":"37074513300"},{"name":"Ryoichi Sasaki","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Ritsumeikan University Kusatsu-shi, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoichi","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"37293566000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6563-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"7273323","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2955},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Security","Wireless sensor networks","Digital forensics","Mobile communication","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","digital forensics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fog computing","cloud computing paradigm","location sensitivity","wireless connectivity","geographical accessibility","cloud security","cloud forensics","fog forensics","fog security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fog Computing","Fog Forensics","Fog Security","Cloud Computing","Cloud Security","Cloud Forensics"]}],"abstract":"Although Fog Computing is defined as the extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, its distinctive characteristics in the location sensitivity, wireless connectivity, and geographical accessibility create new security and forensics issues and challenges which have not been well studied in Cloud security and Cloud forensics.

Monitoring of multiple physical events using sensors and data collection at central gateways is the general architecture followed by most commercial, residential and test bed implementations. Most of the events monitored at regular intervals are largely redundant/minor variations leading to large wastage of data storage resources in Big data servers and communication energy at relay and sensor nodes. In this paper a novel architecture of Neural Network (NN) based day ahead steady state forecasting engine is implemented at the gateway using historical database. Gateway generates an optimal transmit schedules based on NN outputs thereby reducing the redundant sensor data when there is minor variations in the respective predicted sensor estimates. It is observed that NN based load forecasting for power monitoring system predicts load with less than 3% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Gateway forward transmit schedules to all power sensing nodes day ahead to reduce sensor and relay nodes communication energy. Mat lab based simulation for evaluating the benefits of proposed model for extending the wireless network life time is developed and confirmed with an emulation scenario of our testbed. Network life time is improved by 43% from the observed results using proposed model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273414/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15476075","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7273414/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"1-5 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Short Term Forecasting Engine to Optimize Energy and Big Data Storage Resources of Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Short Term Forecasting Engine to Optimize Energy and Big Data Storage Resources of Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"6564c511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064491S","chronDate":"1-5 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7271781","isNumber":"7273299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7271781","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7273299","articleId":"7273414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7273481,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmedullah Aziz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Ahmedullah","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37085589751"},{"name":"Nikhil Shukla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Shukla","id":"38466972100"},{"name":"Suman Datta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Datta","id":"37085420463"},{"name":"Sumeet Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Sumeet Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37279067800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8009-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7273481","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273481","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Magnetic tunneling","Resistance","Transistors","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic tunnelling","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["COAST","STT","MRAM","spin-transfer torque","magnetic tunnel junction","MTJ","memory cell","correlated material","cell tunneling magneto-resistance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlated material","insulator-to-metal transition","magnetic tunnel junction","metal-to-insulator transition","magneto-resistance","phase transition","STT MRAM"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel technique for optimizing the read operation of spin-transfer torque (STT) MRAMs by employing a correlated material in conjunction with a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). The design of the proposed memory cell is based on exploiting the orders-of-magnitude difference in the resistance of the two phases of the correlated material (CM) and triggering operation-driven phase transitions in the CM by judiciously co-optimizing devices and the memory cell. During read, the CM operates in the metallic and insulating phases when the MTJ is in the low resistance and high resistance states, respectively. This leads to superior distinguishability, read efficiency and stability. During write, the CM operates in the metallic phase, which minimizes the impact of the CM resistance on the write speed. Our analysis shows that CM amplifies the cell tunneling magneto-resistance from 107% (for the standard STT MRAM) to 1878% (for the proposed cell) leading to 68% higher sense margin. In addition, 45% enhancement in the read disturb margin and 36% reduction in the cell read power is achieved. At the same time, the write asymmetry associated with different state transitions is mildly mitigated, leading to 9% reduction in the write power. This comes at a negligible cost of 4% larger write time. We also discuss the layout implications of our technique and propose the sharing of the CM amongst multiple cells. As a result of the sharing, the proposed technique incurs no area penalty.","doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273481","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7257319/7273468/07273481.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"COAST: Correlated material assisted STT MRAMs for optimized read operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"COAST: Correlated material assisted STT MRAMs for optimized read operation","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273481/","accessionNumber":"15486374","publicationDate":"July 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"COAST: Correlated material assisted STT MRAMs for optimized read operation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"s011161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058407S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7257319","isNumber":"7273468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7257319","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7273468","articleId":"7273481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7273482,"authors":[{"name":"Seyedhamidreza Motaman","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida"],"firstName":"Seyedhamidreza","lastName":"Motaman","id":"37085399137"},{"name":"Swaroop Ghosh","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida"],"firstName":"Swaroop","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37273380600"},{"name":"Jaydeep P.

We propose a novel slope detection technique to exploit MTJ resistance switching from high to low state using low-overhead sample-and-hold circuit. The proposed sensing technique is destructive in nature and can be combined with double sampling for improved robustness.

PCM has similar read power and latency as DRAM; however, its write power and latency are significantly higher than DRAM. Therefore, one challenge with PCM is how to increase write throughput under write power budget constraints. To increase write concurrency, PCM often adopts division programming, where a write occurs in a series of divisions, so that writes to different banks proceed concurrently. In this study, we observe that since the write scheduling granularity in the memory controller differs from the actual write granularity in PCM chips, i.e., requests vs. divisions, the available power budget cannot be fully utilized. We therefore propose enhancing the interface between the memory controller and PCM chips to allow the memory controller to schedule writes in the division granularity. To further increase power budget utilization, we design a variable-length division mechanism to allow the division granularity to be adjusted at runtime according to the available write power budget. Our experimental results show that these techniques improve system performance by up to 65%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15486355","htmlLink":"/document/7273484/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fine-grained write scheduling for PCM performance improvement under write power budget","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-grained write scheduling for PCM performance improvement under write power budget","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"s014047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081938S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7257319","isNumber":"7273468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7257319","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7273468","articleId":"7273484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7273488,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Yueh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Yueh","id":"38232101200"},{"name":"Zhimin Wan","affiliation":["George Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Wan","id":"37085470849"},{"name":"Yogendra Joshi","affiliation":["George Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yogendra","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37272676600"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278557500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8009-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7273488","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"This paper, for the first time, experimentally demonstrated the in-package microfluidic cooling on a commercial System-on-Chip (SoC).

Although heavy banking benefits RF throughput, its associated area and energy costs with diminishing performance gains greatly limit future RF s-caling. In this paper, we propose an improved RF design with a bank stealing technique, which enables a high RF throughput with compact area. By deeply investigating the GPGPU microarchitecture, we identify the deficiency in the state-of-the-art RF designs as the bank conflict problem, while the majority of conflicts can be eliminated leveraging the fact that the highly-banked RF oftentimes experiences under-utilization. This is especially true in GPGPU where multiple ready warps are available at the scheduling stage with their operands to be wisely coordinated. Our lightweight bank stealing technique can opportunistically fill the idle banks for better operand service, and the average GPGPU performance can be improved under smaller energy budget with significant area saving, which makes it promising for sustainable RF scaling.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273468","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7257319/7273468/07273490.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bank stealing for conflict mitigation in GPGPU Register File","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273490/","displayDocTitle":"Bank stealing for conflict mitigation in GPGPU Register File","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15475862","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bank stealing for conflict mitigation in GPGPU Register File","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"s032152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073883S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7257319","isNumber":"7273468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7257319","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7273468","articleId":"7273490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7273493,"authors":[{"name":"David May","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Mtinchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"May","id":"37373937900"},{"name":"Walter Stechele","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Stechele"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8009-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7273493","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273493","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Registers","Error probability","Circuit faults","Approximation algorithms","Emulation","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational circuits","field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","quality of service","sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine grained sequential approximate circuits","probability aware fault emulation","approximate computing","power consumption","integrated circuits","deterministic implementations","application-driven QoS definition","approximated RTL","FPGA-based fault emulation","combinational circuits","approximate complete sequential circuits"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273493","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7257319/7273468/07273493.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of fine-grained sequential approximate circuits using probability-aware fault emulation","abstract":"Approximate Computing has recently drawn interest due to its promise to substantially decrease the power consumption of integrated circuits. By tolerating a certain imprecision at a circuit output, the circuit can be operated at a more resource-saving state. For instance, parts of the circuit could be switched off or driven at sub-threshold voltage. Clearly, not all applications are suitable for this approach. Especially applications from the signal and image processing domain are applicable, due to their intrinsic tolerance to imprecision. But even for these circuits, one has to be very careful where to approximate a circuit and to what extent, in order not to fall below a minimum required QoS. In this paper we are presenting an approach to generate approximate circuits from existing deterministic implementations. The flow reaches from application-driven QoS definition down to approximated RTL. We are employing FPGA-based fault emulation of the circuit in order to find out how faults, i.e. imprecisions in the circuit, affect the overall circuit behavior. Most existing approaches only consider combinational circuits. Our proposed methodology is able to approximate complete sequential circuits. Due to the FPGA-based emulation, our approach is very fast and accurate. And furthermore, it allows us to fine-granular tune the resulting precision to the required QoS, in order to get the most out of the approximation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273493/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15486372","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of fine-grained sequential approximate circuits using probability-aware fault emulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of fine-grained sequential approximate circuits using probability-aware fault emulation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"s041146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065061S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7257319","isNumber":"7273468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7257319","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7273468","articleId":"7273493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7273494,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Zervakis","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Zervakis","id":"37074666700"},{"name":"Sotirios Xydis","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Sotirios","lastName":"Xydis","id":"37391631000"},{"name":"Kostas Tsoumanis","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Tsoumanis","id":"38542743300"},{"name":"Dimitrios Soudris","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Soudris","id":"37271305000"},{"name":"Kiamal Pekmestzi","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Kiamal","lastName":"Pekmestzi","id":"37283956600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8009-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7273494","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273494","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Compressors","Hybrid power systems","Power demand","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","logic circuits","low-power electronics","multiplying circuits","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid approximate multiplier architectures","improved power-accuracy trade-offs","multilevel approximation","logic circuit level","low power approximate arithmetic architectures","hardware multipliers","limited power savings","approximation techniques","approximate arithmetic circuit","power consumption","heuristic optimization","low-power approximate multipliers"]}],"abstract":"Approximate computing forms a promising design alternative for inherently error resilient applications, trading accuracy for power savings. In this paper, we exploit multi-level approximation, i.e. at the algorithmic, the logic and the circuit level, to design low power approximate arithmetic architectures for hardware multipliers. Motivated from the limited power savings that approximation techniques can achieve in isolation, we explore hybrid methods that apply simultaneously more than one techniques from different layers. We introduce the concept of perforation for approximate arithmetic circuit design and we explore the newly defined design space of hybrid designs showing that it leads to lower power consumption at every examined error range. To address the increased complexity of the target design space, we introduce an heuristic optimization technique and the corresponding design framework that automatically generates hybrid low-power approximate multipliers requiring a small number of design evaluations, i.e. synthesis, simulation, power and timing analysis. Through extensive experimentation, we show that the proposed techniques converge towards optimal solutions and deliver approximate designs that are always more efficient with respect to state-of-art approaches. Power savings of 11% are reported for small error bounds and more than 30% in case of more relaxed error constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273494","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7257319/7273468/07273494.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid approximate multiplier architectures for improved power-accuracy trade-offs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273494/","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid approximate multiplier architectures for improved power-accuracy trade-offs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15486370","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273494/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid approximate multiplier architectures for improved power-accuracy trade-offs","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"s042188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110442S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7257319","isNumber":"7273468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7257319","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7273468","articleId":"7273494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7273495,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeha Kung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jaeha","lastName":"Kung","id":"37085349274"},{"name":"Duckhwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Duckhwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085342980"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37085345431"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8009-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7273495","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":615},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273495","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Artificial neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Hardware","Neurons","Power demand","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-aware digital feedforward neural network platform","backpropagation driven approximate synapses","backpropagation algorithm","energy-quality trade-off","quality constraint","synaptic weight","coupled software","full-chip design","recognition accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["approximate computing","digital feedforward neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273495","endPage":"90","startPage":"85","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7257319/7273468/07273495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A power-aware digital feedforward neural network platform with backpropagation driven approximate synapses","abstract":"This paper proposes a power-aware digital feedforward neural network platform that utilizes the backpropagation algorithm during training to enable energy-quality trade-off.

Traditionally, SRAM has been used as an area and power efficient implementation of the router buffer. However, motivated by the smaller size and lower-power potential of planar embedded DRAM (eDRAM), we implement the router buffer using a 3T NMOS eDRAM for improved power and area efficiency. We demonstrate that the lifetime of flits stalled in the NoC router buffer is much shorter than the retention time of currently available eDRAM. This observation allows us to make the appropriate trade-off in size and sense-amplifier complexity to meet requirements of power and performance. A low-overhead need-based refresh mechanism is further explored. With a conservative buffer design using 65nm CMOS technology, our method reduces buffer area by up to 52% and power by 43%, while maintaining performance similar to a SRAM-based buffer. In a NoC router with 128-bit channel width, we achieve 26% and 11% reduction of total router area and power respectively. We conclude that eDRAM-based buffer is a power and area efficient alternative to SRAM-based buffer for NoC router design.","doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2015.7273500","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7257319/7273468/07273500.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact low-power eDRAM-based NoC buffer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A compact low-power eDRAM-based NoC buffer","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273500/","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15486386","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273500/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact low-power eDRAM-based NoC buffer","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"s054271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062056S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7257319","isNumber":"7273468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7257319","xplore-issue":"7273468","articleId":"7273500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7273503,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Singh","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085663901"},{"name":"Monodeep Kar","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"],"firstName":"Monodeep","lastName":"Kar"},{"name":"Jong Hwan Ko","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Jong Hwan","lastName":"Ko","id":"37085676198"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278557500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8009-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7273503","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Bandwidth","Engines","Encryption","System-on-chip","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power attack protection","resource constrained encryption engine","integrated low-drop-out regulator","low-power encryption engine","secure encryption engine","on-chip low dropout regulator","compact encryption engine","advanced encryption standard","AES","behavioral modeling","on-chip LDO","power attack resistance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Side Channel Attack","Lightweight Cryptography","Hardware Security","IoT security"]}],"abstract":"The power attack protection of encryption engines often comes at the expense of area, power, and/or performance overheads making the design of a low-power and compact but secure encryption engine challenging.

Among various tools proposed, McPAT has gained some popularity due to its easy-to-use analytical power models. However, McPAT's prediction has several limitations. Although under- or over-estimated power from unmodeled and mis-modeled parts offset each other, it still incorporates errors in each block. Moreover, the lack of awareness to the implementation details exacerbates the prediction inaccuracies. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new methodology to train McPAT towards precise processor power prediction using power measurements from real hardware. This calibration enables McPAT's power to fit to the target processor power. Once we adjusted the power consumption of each block to best match those in the target processor, our trained McPAT delivered more precise power estimation.

The predictive 7nm Process Design Kit (PDK) and standard cell library for both high performance (HP) and low standby power (LSTP) device technologies are built based on NanGate 45nm PDK using accurate dimensional, material, and electrical parameters from publications and a commercial-grade tool flow. In addition, we implement full-chip M3D GDS layouts using both 7nm HP and LSTP cells and industry-standard physical design tools, and evaluate the resulting full-chip power, performance, and area metrics. Our study first shows that 7nm HP M3D designs outperform 7nm HP 2D designs by 16.8% in terms of iso-performance total power reduction. Moreover, 7nm LSTP M3D designs reduce the total power consumption by 14.3% compared to their 2D counterparts.

However, ensuring high reliability with reduced power consumption necessitates joint considerations of variations in vulnerability, performance and power properties of software as well as the underlying hardware. In this paper, we propose a power-efficient reliability management system for many-core processors. It exploits various basic redundancy techniques (like, dual and triple modular redundancy) operating in different voltage-frequency levels, each offering distinct reliability, performance and power properties. Our system performs Dynamic Redundancy and Voltage Scaling (DRVS) considering process variations in hardware, and diversities in software vulnerability and execution time properties.

Digital systems can exploit this error tolerance to increase their energy efficiency, which is crucial in high performance wearable electronics and in emerging low power systems for the internet-of-things. A dynamic energy-accuracy trade-off brings an extra degree of freedom for system level power management. We introduce the concept of Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling and illustrate its analogy to Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling. Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling proves to have higher energy gains at most output qualities compared to other approximate computing alternatives. This work further generalizes the Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling concept to pipelined structures and quantifies its energy overhead. Shallow pipelined multipliers with two to four dynamic accuracy modes can be supported with limited (<; 10-20%) overhead, resulting in significant energy savings of up to 90% or more for less than 2% mean error. DVAS is finally applied to a JPEG image processing application, demonstrating large system level gains without noticeable impact to user or application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273520/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475864","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"DVAS: Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling for increased energy-efficiency in approximate computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DVAS: Dynamic Voltage Accuracy Scaling for increased energy-efficiency in approximate computing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"s1101006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045504S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7257319","isNumber":"7273468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7257319","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7273468","articleId":"7273520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7273553,"authors":[{"name":"Nilanjan Ray","affiliation":["Computing Science Department, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221020/7775117/7273553/ray-2480712-small.gif","p":["Nilanjan Ray (M\u201903) received the Bachelor's degree in\n mechanical engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 1995, the M.Tech. degree in computer science from\n the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University\n of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA, in 2003.","He was a postdoctoral researcher for two years and had worked for one year in industry.

Significant cardiac and respiratory motion of the living subject, occasional spells of focal plane changes, drift in the field of view, and long image sequences are the principal roadblocks. The first step in such a registration process is the removal of translational and rotational motion. Next, a deformable registration can be performed. The focus of our study here is to remove the translation and/or rigid body motion that we refer to here as coarse alignment. The existing techniques for coarse alignment are unable to accommodate long sequences often consisting of periods of poor quality images (as quantified by a suitable perceptual measure). Many existing methods require the user to select an anchor image to which other images are registered. We propose a novel method for coarse image sequence alignment based on minimum weighted spanning trees (MISTICA) that overcomes these difficulties. The principal idea behind MISTICA is to reorder the images in shorter sequences, to demote nonconforming or poor quality images in the registration process, and to mitigate the error propagation. The anchor image is selected automatically making MISTICA completely automated. MISTICA is computationally efficient. It has a single tuning parameter that determines graph width, which can also be eliminated by the way of additional computation. MISTICA outperforms existing alignment methods when applied to microscopy image sequences of mouse arteries.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2015.2480712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7775117/07273553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2015.2480712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7775117","startPage":"1575","endPage":"1584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MISTICA: Minimum Spanning Tree-Based Coarse Image Alignment for Microscopy Image Sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MISTICA: Minimum Spanning Tree-Based Coarse Image Alignment for Microscopy Image Sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16521086","pubMedId":"26415193","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7273553/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MISTICA: Minimum Spanning Tree-Based Coarse Image Alignment for Microscopy Image Sequences","sourcePdf":"jbhi-ray-2480712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087483S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7775117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7775117","articleId":"7273553","onlineDate":"21 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273591,"authors":[{"name":"Alfredo Cuzzocrea","affiliation":["ICAR-CNR and University of Calabria Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Cuzzocrea","id":"37282811300"},{"name":"Enzo Mumolo","affiliation":["DIA Department, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy"],"firstName":"Enzo","lastName":"Mumolo","id":"37329259900"},{"name":"Riccardo Cecolin","affiliation":["DIA Department, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Cecolin","id":"37085563841"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6563-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"7273591","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Computational modeling","Detection algorithms","Discrete cosine transforms","Benchmark testing","Runtime","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","embedded systems","error statistics","hidden Markov models","program debugging","storage management","system recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["runtime anomaly detection","embedded system","binary tracing","hidden Markov model","embedded computing system","deployed software","embedded computing device","human intervention","memory sequence","memory reference sequence","PIN tracing tool","randomly selected block","discrete cosine transform","SPEC 2006 CPU benchmark suite","error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","HMM","run-time analysis","spectral analysis","memory address"]}],"abstract":"Embedded computing systems are very vulnerable to anomalies that can occur during execution of deployed software.

In this paper we describe a novel approach to detect an anomaly during execution of one or more applications. The algorithm exploits the differences between the behavior of memory sequences generated during executions. Memory reference sequences are monitored in real time using the PIN tracing tool. The memory reference sequence is divided into randomly selected blocks and spectrally described with the Discrete Cosine Transform. Experimental analysis is based on the SPEC 2006 CPU benchmark suite, and show very low error rates for the anomalies tested.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.89","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7271781/7273573/07273591.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime Anomaly Detection in Embedded Systems by Binary Tracing and Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273591/","displayDocTitle":"Runtime Anomaly Detection in Embedded Systems by Binary Tracing and Hidden Markov Models","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15475982","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273591/","conferenceDate":"1-5 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime Anomaly Detection in Embedded Systems by Binary Tracing and Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"6564b015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096373S","chronDate":"1-5 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7271781","isNumber":"7273573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7271781","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7273573","articleId":"7273591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7273665,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangtao Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, China","Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085457059"},{"name":"Yasha Wang","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center of Software Engineering, Peking University, China","Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yasha","lastName":"Wang","id":"37560403800"},{"name":"Junfeng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, China","Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37598309000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6563-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"7273665","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Mobile communication","Recruitment","Software","Mobile handsets","Runtime","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","programming","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["campaign initiators","mobile crowd sensing apps","supporting framework","MCS applications","MCSA","software development skills","programming skills"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Crowd Sensing","Initiator","Supporting Framework"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273665","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7271781/7273573/07273665.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Helping Campaign Initiators Create Mobile Crowd Sensing Apps: A Supporting Framework","abstract":"Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) refers to the sensing paradigm in which mobile users with sensing and computing devices are tasked to collect and contribute data in order to enable various applications. The initiators of mobile crowd sensing campaigns are suitable to be ones for creating MCS applications (MCSA). However, the relatively high requirements in software development skills become the barrier for initiators to create MCSA. In this paper, we propose a supporting framework for the initiators who lack of software development skills to build MCSA in a quick and simple way. It enables initiators to build MCSA by just doing some simple settings, which totally eliminates the requirement of programming skills. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the framework as far as the functionality and efficiency are concerned.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273665/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15475998","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Helping Campaign Initiators Create Mobile Crowd Sensing Apps: A Supporting Framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Helping Campaign Initiators Create Mobile Crowd Sensing Apps: A Supporting Framework","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"6564b545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052909S","chronDate":"1-5 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7271781","isNumber":"7273573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7271781","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7273573","articleId":"7273665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7273697,"authors":[{"name":"Yunjoo Park","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yunjoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37085658996"},{"name":"Hyokyung Bahn","affiliation":["Ewha Womans University, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Hyokyung","lastName":"Bahn"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6563-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"7273697","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273697","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Random access memory","Memory management","Performance evaluation","Software","Computers","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","phase change memories","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual memory system management","high performance PCM","high performance NVM storage","STT-RAM","legacy software layers","HDDs","PCM swap devices","performance evaluation","DIMM slots","software stack overhead","context switch time","memory management mechanisms","page size","read-ahead options","page replacement algorithms","total memory capacity","page fault handling time","DRAM memory","energy consumption reduction","system software development"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase-change memory","swap system","page size","virtual memory"]}],"abstract":"As high performance NVM storage such as PCM or STT-RAM emerges, legacy software layers optimized for HDDs should be revisited. This paper explores the performance of a system that uses PCM as the swap device of virtual memory and discusses how this system can be managed efficiently. Specifically, we explore the challenges and implications of using PCM swap devices with a broad range of experiments in comparison with traditional HDD swap devices. For PCM swap devices, we evaluate the performance by attaching PCM on DIMM slots, thereby eliminating the software stack overhead of block I/O and the context switch time. To assess the potential benefit of PCM swap devices, we change various configurations and perform experiments to quantify the effects of memory management mechanisms and parameters such as page size, read-ahead options, page replacement algorithms, and total memory capacity. The results show that reducing the page size and turning off the read-ahead option improve the performance of PCM-based swap systems where the page fault handling time is sufficiently small. We also show that the performance is not degraded even with a small DRAM memory under a PCM swap device, this leads to the reduction of DRAM's energy consumption significantly compared to HDD-based swap systems. We anticipate that our results will provide directions in system software development in presence of ever faster swap devices.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.136","startPage":"764","endPage":"772","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7271781/7273573/07273697.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Management of Virtual Memory Systems under High Performance PCM-based Swap Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273697/","conferenceDate":"1-5 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Management of Virtual Memory Systems under High Performance PCM-based Swap Devices","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475996","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273697/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Management of Virtual Memory Systems under High Performance PCM-based Swap Devices","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"6564b764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060451S","chronDate":"1-5 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7271781","isNumber":"7273573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7271781","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7273573","articleId":"7273697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7273724,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina Gatteschi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Valentina","lastName":"Gatteschi","id":"38234097200"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lamberti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lamberti","id":"37394958100"},{"name":"Gianluca Paravati","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Paravati","id":"37394948200"},{"name":"Andrea Sanna","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Sanna","id":"37351391600"},{"name":"Claudio Demartini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Demartini","id":"37353013100"},{"name":"Alberto Lisanti","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Lisanti","id":"37085632569"},{"name":"Giorgio Venezia","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Venezia","id":"37085628810"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6563-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"7273724","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1687},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273724","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Prototypes","Global Positioning System","Batteries","Context","Drugs","Propellers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","drug delivery systems","helicopters","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delivery service","drone-based goods delivery","prototype system","quadcopter","autonomous drug shipment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["drone","quadcopter","delivery service","drug","mobile"]}],"abstract":"Drone-based delivery of goods could become a reality in the near future, as witnessed by the increasing successful experiences in both research and commercial fields.

This paper aims to give physical insights into the stability of dc-bus voltage control affected by ac-bus voltage control in VSC connected to weak grid. The concepts of damping and restoring components are developed for dc-bus voltage to describe the stability of dc-bus voltage control. The impact of ac-bus voltage control on dc-bus voltage control stability can be revealed by investigating the impact of ac-bus voltage control on damping and restoring components essentially. Furthermore, the detailed analysis for the impact of ac-bus voltage control on damping and restoring components is presented considering varied ac system strengths, operating points, and ac-bus voltage control parameters. The simulation results from 1.5-MW full-capacity wind power generation system are demonstrated which conform well to the analysis. Finally, the experimental results validate the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2015.2480859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/7463098/07273745.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2015.2480859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7463098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC-Bus Voltage Control Stability Affected by AC-Bus Voltage Control in VSCs Connected to Weak AC Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273745/","displayDocTitle":"DC-Bus Voltage Control Stability Affected by AC-Bus Voltage Control in VSCs Connected to Weak AC Grids","volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15956363","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273745/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB215100"},{"fundingName":"Major Program through the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51190104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51277196"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University through the Ministry of Education, China","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0221"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC-Bus Voltage Control Stability Affected by AC-Bus Voltage Control in VSCs Connected to Weak AC Grids","sourcePdf":"jestpe-hu-2480859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100441S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"7463098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"7463098","articleId":"7273745","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273747,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaju Ma","affiliation":["Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245494/7305857/7273747/ma-2480767-small.gif","p":["Jiaju Ma (S\u201912) was born in China.

We demonstrate the efficacy of these optimal schemes by comparing with several greedy algorithms through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2475702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7875385/07273752.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2475702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7875385","startPage":"7","endPage":"19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Association in Massive MIMO HetNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273752","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4267003/7875385/7273752-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"User Association in Massive MIMO HetNets","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16724824","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7273752/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1247955 and CNS-1320664"},{"fundingName":"Wireless Engineering Research and Education Center at Auburn University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"User Association in Massive MIMO HetNets","sourcePdf":"jsyst-mao-2475702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18195S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7875385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7875385","articleId":"7273752","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273757,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Casella","firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Casella"},{"name":"Alfeu Sguarezi","firstName":"Alfeu","lastName":"Sguarezi"},{"name":"Carlos Capovilla","firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Capovilla"},{"name":"Tarcio Barros","firstName":"Tarcio","lastName":"Barros"},{"name":"Ernesto Ruppert","affiliation":["Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, SP, BR"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Ruppert"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-0992"}],"articleNumber":"7273757","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Region 9","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/reg/9/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273757","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Irrigation","Process control","Robustness","Monitoring","Niobium","Reluctance machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective surfaces","parity check codes","power control","power generation control","power generation reliability","reluctance machines","robust control","smart power grids","wind power","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind energy generation","supergrid","renewable energy system","SRM","smart grid","advanced communication infrastructure","robust control system","wireless coded power control","low density parity check coding","switched reluctance machine","frequency selective fading propagation condition","robustness improvement","reliability improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["direct power control","LDPC","SRG","wind energy","wireless communications"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TLA.2015.7273757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel7/9907/7273753/07273757.pdf","startPage":"2048","endPage":"2056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2015.7273757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SRM Applied in Wind Generation at Smart Grids Employing Wireless Power Control","abstract":"The wind energy generation is the huge driver behind the push for supergrids and cross-border infrastructure for renewable energy systems into smart grids.

The deadzone is modeled as a combination of a linear term and a disturbance-like term. Based on this model, a differential neural network is employed in order to identify the uncertain dynamics. By using a Lyapunov-like analyses, the asymptotic converge of the identification error to a bounded zone is demonstrated. Next, by a proper control law, the state of the neural network is compelled to follow a bounded reference trajectory. We prove that the difference between the state of the neural identifier and the reference trajectory converges exponentially to zero. Thus, the asymptotical convergence of the tracking error to a bounded zone and the boundedness of all closed-loop signals are guaranteed. Since this control strategy requires the knowledge of a bound for an uncertainty/disturbance term, a systematic procedure is provided in order to find such bound. A simulation example confirms the workability of the suggested approach.","doi":"10.1109/TLA.2015.7273762","startPage":"2085","endPage":"2093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel7/9907/7273753/07273762.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2015.7273762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Uncertain Plants with Unknown Deadzone via Differential Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["RNA","Silicon","Trajectory","Biological neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Silicon compounds","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","trajectory control","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertain plants control","unknown deadzone","differential neural networks","trajectory tracking","SISO uncertain nonlinear systems","symmetric deadzone input","linear term","disturbance-like term","uncertain dynamics","Lyapunov-like analyses","asymptotic converge","identification error","bounded zone","bounded reference trajectory","neural identifier","uncertainty-disturbance term"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deadzone","identification","neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Control of Uncertain Plants with Unknown Deadzone via Differential Neural Networks","volume":"13","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475049","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Uncertain Plants with Unknown Deadzone via Differential Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"13TLA7_09PerezCruz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043725S","chronDate":"July  2015","isNumber":"7273753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","citationCount":"3","articleId":"7273762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7273813,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Chieh Chen","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Jung-Chieh Chen (S\u201902\u2013M\u201905) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Tatung Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree in communications engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.","Since August 2005, he has been at the Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, as an Assistant Professor, where he was promoted to an Associate Professor in March 2009 and then to a Full Professor in March 2012.

The principle of crosstalk reduction by using a backward Raman pump is revealed by analytical expressions and verified by simulations. The crosstalk reduction is attributed to the unique power evolution of the signals caused by the monotonically increasing parametric pump power in the Raman-assisted FOPA. We obtain more than 7-dB reduction in FWM crosstalk initiated from both degenerate-FWM and nondegenerate-FWM processes in the Raman-assisted FOPA, as compared to a conventional FOPA with equivalent signal gain. The experimental results show excellent agreement with the simulations. We also discuss the effects of signal channel number and the powers of the parametric pump and the Raman pump on the FWM crosstalk. The simulation results indicate that under the same level of signal gain, the amount of crosstalk reduction can be increased by using a stronger Raman pump associated with a weaker parametric pump.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2480858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2480858","startPage":"4746","endPage":"4751","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7300504/07273815.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Raman-Assisted Crosstalk Reduction in Multi-Wavelength Fiber Optical Parametric Amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Raman-Assisted Crosstalk Reduction in Multi-Wavelength Fiber Optical Parametric Amplification","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","volume":"33","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273815/","accessionNumber":"15553355","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273815/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research"},{"fundingName":"GRF","grantNumber":"416213 and 14206614"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Raman-Assisted Crosstalk Reduction in Multi-Wavelength Fiber Optical Parametric Amplification","sourcePdf":"jlt-guo-2480858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067471S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7300504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7300504","articleId":"7273815","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7273816,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Rita Palattella","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7362261/7273816/palat-2480886-small.gif","p":["Maria Rita Palattella (S\u201904\u2013M\u201907) received the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from the Scuola Interpolitecnica di Dottorato and Politecnico di Bari, Italy, in 2011.

The quality of service provided by the underlying industrial communication network is a key requisite for quality of control. In this context, the WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and IEEE802.15.4e time-slotted channel hopping standards contribute novel protocols to support quasi-deterministic services, based on wireless short-range communication technologies. The recently created IETF 6TiSCH working group binds IPv6 to this market. Within the 6TiSCH architecture, the 6top sublayer manages the way communication resources are scheduled in time and frequency. The on-the-fly (OTF) bandwidth reservation module plays a complementary role; it is a distributed approach for adapting the scheduled bandwidth to network requirements. This paper first describes the OTF module and its interactions with the 6top sublayer. It then presents the simulation results of the OTF, drawn from a realistic 50-sensor mote multi-hop network that models a small industrial plant. Results show that the OTF can attain an end-to-end latency of the order of a second, with over 99% end-to-end reliability. The first real-world OTF implementation in OpenWSN is presented to demonstrate that it can easily be added within the 6TiSCH architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273816/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15683686","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On-the-Fly Bandwidth Reservation for 6TiSCH Wireless Industrial Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CoSDN Project through the Fonds National de la Recherche, Luxembourg","grantNumber":"INTER/POLLUX/12/4434480"},{"fundingName":"Anillo Project","grantNumber":"ACT-53"},{"fundingName":"Fondecyt","grantNumber":"11121475"},{"fundingName":"CIRIC Project entitled Network Design through the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, Chile"},{"fundingName":"PON project (RES NOVAE) funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research"},{"fundingName":"European Union (European Social Fund)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-the-Fly Bandwidth Reservation for 6TiSCH Wireless Industrial Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-palattella-2480886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082428S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7362261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7362261","articleId":"7273816","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7273820,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

However, PCM/MLC PCM suffers from long write latency and large write energy. Recent work has proposed a compiler directed dual-write (CDDW) scheme to combat the drawbacks of PCM by adopting fast or slow mode for different write operations. For large-scale loops, we observe that write instances' lifetime is very long and can only be written by the expensive slow mode. This paper proposes a write mode aware loop tiling approach to effectively reduce the lifetime of write instances and maximize the number of efficient fast writes in loops. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improves performance by 50.8 percent and reduces dynamic energy by 32.0 percent across a set of benchmarks compared to the CDDW approach on average.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Write Mode Aware Loop Tiling for High Performance Low Power Volatile PCM in Embedded Systems","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2479605","startPage":"2313","endPage":"2324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2479605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7486166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7486166/07273842.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Write Mode Aware Loop Tiling for High Performance Low Power Volatile PCM in Embedded Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7273842/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16054866","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"CityU 123811"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Imaging Technology"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"IDHT20150507"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472260, 61402302 and 61502321"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"4132016 and 4143060"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Write Mode Aware Loop Tiling for High Performance Low Power Volatile PCM in Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"tc-qiu-2479605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134805S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7486166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7486166","articleId":"7273842","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273843,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Mei","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/7523352/7273843/mei-2480336-small.gif","p":["\n\nJie Mei received the B.S. degree in information and computing science \nfrom Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from the \nHarbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2011.","He was an exchange Ph.D. student supported by the China Scholarship Council with the Department of Electrical and \nComputer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA, from 2009 to 2011.

Unlike the existing consensus algorithms for second-order multi-agent systems in which all agents are assumed to have common unit inertias or share common control gains, we allow the inertias and the control gains to be heterogeneous and time-varying for each agent. We propose fully distributed consensus algorithms over a general directed graph when there exist, respectively, absolute velocity damping and relative velocity damping. Novel integral-type Lyapunov functions are proposed to study the consensus convergence. Moreover, the adaptive \u03c3-modification schemes for the gain adaptation are proposed, which renders smaller control gains and thus requires smaller amplitude on the control input without sacrificing consensus convergence. Furthermore, we show that one proposed algorithm also works for consensus of agents with intrinsic Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics. The control gains are varying and updated by distributed adaptive laws. As a result, the proposed algorithms require no global information and thus can be implemented in a fully distributed manner.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2015.2480336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7523352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2015.2480336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic

Game for Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the problem of spectrum access decision-making for the secondary users (SUs) in the cognitive radio networks. When the primary users (PUs) are absent on certain frequency bandwidth, SUs can formulate a queue and wait for the base station (BS) to serve. The queue of the SUs will be dismissed if the PU is emerging in the system. Leveraging the queueing game approaches, the decision-making process of the SUs that whether to queue or not is studied. Both individual equilibrium and social optimization strategies are derived analytically. Moreover, the optimal pricing strategy of the service provider is investigated as well. Our proposed algorithms and corresponding analysis are validated through simulation studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","volume":"19","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"15587157","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273844/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Queueing Game for Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"284748"},{"fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1443917, ECCS-1405121, CNS-1265268 and CNS-0953377"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61428101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queueing Game for Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-chang-2480768-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064441S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7322307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7322307","articleId":"7273844","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7273846,"authors":[{"name":"Changyang She","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7273846/she-2480770_print-small.gif","p":["\nChangyang She (S'12) received the B.Eng. degree from Honors College of Beihang University (formerly Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, BUAA), Beijing, China, in 2012.

To avoid wasting energy when serving random sources over wireless channels, we convert the QoS exponent, a key parameter to characterize statistical QoS guarantee under the framework of effective bandwidth and effective capacity, into multi-state QoS exponents dependent on the queue length. To illustrate how to optimize resource allocation, we consider multi-input-multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. A general method to optimize the queue length based bandwidth and power allocation (QRA) policy is proposed, which maximizes the EE under the statistical QoS constraint. A closed-form optimal QRA policy is derived for massive MIMO-OFDM system with infinite antennas serving the first order autoregressive source. The EE limit obtained from infinite delay bound and the achieved EEs of different policies under finite delay bounds are analyzed. Simulation and numerical results show that the EE achieved by the QRA policy approaches the EE limit when the delay bound is large, and is much higher than those achieved by existing policies considering statistical QoS provision when the delay bound is stringent.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2480770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07273846.pdf","startPage":"4125","endPage":"4141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2480770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for MIMO-OFDM Systems Serving Random Sources With Statistical QoS Requirement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273846/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for MIMO-OFDM Systems Serving Random Sources With Statistical QoS Requirement","volume":"63","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676723","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273846/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61120106002"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China, 973 Program","grantNumber":"2012CB316003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1228071, CCF-1422241 and ECCS-1509514"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for MIMO-OFDM Systems Serving Random Sources With Statistical QoS Requirement","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yang-2480770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148615S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7273846","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273848,"authors":[{"name":"Daosen Zhai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Institute of Information Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7273848/zhai-2480762_print-small.gif","p":["\nDaosen Zhai received the B.E. degree in telecommunication engineering at Shandong University, Weihai, China, in 2012.

To fully exploit the harvested energy, an inefficient factor caused by the battery leakage must be taken into account to tackle the energy dissipation problem, which triggers a new dimensional optimization related to the transmission time. However, most approaches are studied for perfect battery models and neglect the optimization for the transmission time. In this paper, we formulate the battery leakage process into our model to explore the grid energy conservation problem by jointly considering admission control, power allocation, subcarrier assignment, and transmission time determination in cellular networks powered by grid and renewable energy. To tackle this problem, we exploit the Lyapunov optimization technique to develop an online algorithm, referred to as leakage-aware dynamic resource allocation policy (LADRA). Specifically, the LADRA only needs to track the current system states (e.g., channel and energy conditions) but without requiring their prior-knowledge. Furthermore, we prove that the minimum grid energy consumption value can be achieved by our proposed algorithm asymptotically. Simulation results verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis, as well as exhibit the performance improvement against other algorithms in terms of grid energy consumption and queue backlog.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"63","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15676734","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273848/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Leakage-Aware Dynamic Resource Allocation in Hybrid Energy Powered Cellular Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231008, 61172079, 61201141, 61301176 and 91338114"},{"fundingName":"863 project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Fund in Xidian University","grantNumber":"7214497201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage-Aware Dynamic Resource Allocation in Hybrid Energy Powered Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-sheng-2480762-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142964S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7273848","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7273855,"authors":[{"name":"Caleb Serafy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, A.

The article shows that the codesign approach achieves better performance and energy efficiency than optimizing only the cooling capacity or the vertical bandwidth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273855/","volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7273855/","accessionNumber":"15806064","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermoelectric Codesign of 3-D CPUs and Embedded Microfluidic Pin-Fin Heatsinks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"Division of Computing and Communication Foundations","grantNumber":"CCF1302375"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"IceCool"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermoelectric Codesign of 3-D CPUs and Embedded Microfluidic Pin-Fin Heatsinks","sourcePdf":"mdat-serafy-2480710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050246S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221038","isNumber":"7419940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221038","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7419940","articleId":"7273855","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7273856,"authors":[{"name":"Jingrong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jingrong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085378847"},{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38468802400"},{"name":"Quanzhong Li","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Quanzhong","lastName":"Li","id":"38238863700"},{"name":"Jiayin Qin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Qin","id":"37272689000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7273856","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273856","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Array signal processing","Jitter","Wireless communication","Energy loss","Transmitting antennas","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductive power transmission","jitter","oscillators","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless energy transfer","oscillator jitter effect","distributed energy beamforming","energy scarcity problem","multiple-input-multiple-output WET system","MIMO WET system","carrier frequency offset","phase noise","energy loss","distributed MIMO channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","distributed energy beamforming","oscillator jitters","phase noise (PHN)","wireless energy transfer (WET)"]},{"kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","distributed energy beamforming","oscillator jitters","phase noise (PHN)","wireless energy transfer (WET)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2480391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7322307/07273856.pdf","startPage":"2045","endPage":"2048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2480391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Oscillator Jitters on Distributed Energy Beamforming for Wireless Energy Transfer","abstract":"In wireless energy transfer (WET), distributed energy beamforming is promising to solve energy scarcity problem while to alleviate potential health and safety problems.

Exploiting the redundancy in PU retransmissions, each SU receiver applies forward interference cancelation to remove a successfully decoded PU message in the subsequent PU retransmissions. The knowledge of the PU message state at the SU receivers and the ACK/NACK message from the PU receiver are sent back to the transmitters. With this approach and using a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) model and constrained multi-agent MDP (CMMDP), centralized and decentralized optimum access policies for SUs are proposed to maximize their average sum throughput under a PU throughput constraint. In the decentralized case, the channel access decision of each SU is unknown to the other SU. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed policies in terms of sum throughput of SUs. The results also reveal that the centralized access policy design outperforms the decentralized design especially when the PU can tolerate a low average long term throughput. Finally, the difficulties in decentralized access policy design with partial state information are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access Policy Design for Cognitive Secondary Users Under a Primary Type-I HARQ Process","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2480846","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07273860.pdf","startPage":"4037","endPage":"4049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2480846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273860/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Access Policy Design for Cognitive Secondary Users Under a Primary Type-I HARQ Process","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7273860/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676749","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access Policy Design for Cognitive Secondary Users Under a Primary Type-I HARQ Process","sourcePdf":"tcomm-joda-2480846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082224S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7273860","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273863,"authors":[{"name":"Baoguang Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.

However, its limited accuracy is one of the main problems preventing its widespread acceptance. Arterial BP oscillates mainly at high frequency (HF) because of respiratory activity, and at low frequency (LF) because of vasomotor tone. Prior studies suggested that PTT can track BP variation in HF range, but was inadequate to follow the LF variation, which is probably the main reason for its unsatisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new indicator, the photoplethysmogram intensity ratio (PIR), which can be affected by changes in the arterial diameter, and, thus, trace the LF variation of BP. Spectral analysis of BP, PTT, PIR, and respiratory signal confirmed that PTT was related to BP in HF at the respiratory frequency, while PIR was associated with BP in LF range. We, therefore, develop a novel BP estimation algorithm by using both PTT and PIR. The proposed algorithm was validated on 27 healthy subjects with continuous Finapres BP as reference. The results showed that the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) for the estimated systolic, diastolic, and mean BP with the proposed method against reference were -0.37 \u00b1 5.21, -0.08 \u00b1 4.06, -0.18 \u00b1 4.13 mmHg, and mean absolute difference (MAD) were 4.09, 3.18, 3.18 mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method outperformed the two most cited PTT algorithms for about 2 mmHg in SD and MAD. These results demonstrated that the proposed BP model using PIR and PTT can estimate continuous BP with improved accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7457176/07273864.pdf","startPage":"964","endPage":"972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2480679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2480679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7457176","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Using Pulse Transit Time and Photoplethysmogram Intensity Ratio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Mathematical model","Accuracy","Biomedical measurement","Algorithm design and analysis","Monitoring","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood pressure measurement","blood vessels","medical signal processing","photoplethysmography","pneumodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous cuffless blood pressure measurement estimation","pulse transit time","photoplethysmogram intensity ratio","high-frequency arterial BP oscillation","respiratory activity","vasomotor tone","arterial diameter","LF variation","spectral analysis","respiratory signal","respiratory frequency","systolic BP estimation algorithm","continuous Finapres BP","standard deviation","diastolic BP","mean BP","mean absolute difference","PTT algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arterial diameter change","cuffless blood pressure","photoplethysmogram intensity ratio","pulse transit time","respiration","vasomotion"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Algorithms","Blood Pressure","Blood Pressure Determination","Female","Humans","Male","Photoplethysmography","Pulse Wave Analysis","Respiration","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Young Adult"]},{"kwd":["Arterial diameter change","cuffless blood pressure","photoplethysmogram intensity ratio (PIR)","pulse transit time (PTT)","respiration","vasomotion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Using Pulse Transit Time and Photoplethysmogram Intensity Ratio","volume":"63","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7273864/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15934534","pubMedId":"26415147","dateOfInsertion":"20 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Guangdong Innovation Research Team Fund for Low-cost Healthcare Technologies in China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"GJHZ1212"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Using Pulse Transit Time and Photoplethysmogram Intensity Ratio","sourcePdf":"tbme-tsang-2480679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07226S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7457176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"7457176","articleId":"7273864","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7273866,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Jie Chieh","affiliation":["Institute of Electro-Optical Science and Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jen-Jie","lastName":"Chieh","id":"37312572400"},{"name":"K.

To improve the screening performance, des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) has been identified as another promising biomarker of HCC, combined with AFP biomarkers. The results of the commercial optical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit easily have the interference problem due to the optical methodology. The immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay based on the magnetic measurement was utilized to assay DCP biomarkers without the excellent antiinterference performances. A DCP magnetic reagent, composed of iron-oxide (Fe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\nO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>\n) magnetic nanoparticles coated with anti-DCP antibodies solved in phosphoryl-buffer solution, was synthesized and characterized. In the test of standard DCP antigens, superior antiinterference and sensitivity than optical ELISA were proved. In the animal test, the results indicate good agreement between the IMR assay findings and the tumor sizes of HCC rats at all time points after the HCC implantation. The feasibility of the developed DCP magnetic reagent with the IMR for the detection of DCP is verified, and demonstrates the high potential for future clinical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7515129/07273866.pdf","startPage":"1681","endPage":"1686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2478845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2478845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7515129","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Immunomagnetic Reduction Assay on Des-Gamma-Carboxy Prothrombin for Screening of Hepatocellular Carcinoma","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical optical imaging","Interference","Optical sensors","Immune system","Magnetic separation","Magnetic cores","Rats"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomagnetism","cancer","enzymes","iron compounds","magnetic particles","nanomagnetics","nanomedicine","nanoparticles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immunomagnetic reduction assay","des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin","hepatocellular carcinoma screening","alpha-fetoprotein biomarker","sensitivity","specificity","screening performance","optical enzyme linked immunosorbent assay","ELISA kit","magnetic measurement","iron oxide","magnetic nanoparticles","Fe3O4"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin","enzyme-linked","hepatocellular carcinoma","immunomagnetic reduction","immunosorbent assay"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Biomarkers","Biomarkers, Tumor","Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Feasibility Studies","Immunomagnetic Separation","Liver Neoplasms","Magnetite Nanoparticles","Male","Protein Precursors","Prothrombin","Rats"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Immunomagnetic Reduction Assay on Des-Gamma-Carboxy Prothrombin for Screening of Hepatocellular Carcinoma","volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7273866/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16156236","pubMedId":"26415145","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council of Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC100-2221-E003-013, NSC 103-2923-M-003-002 and NSC 103-2112-M-003-010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008903","fundingName":"Ministry of Health and Welfare","grantNumber":"MOHW103-TDU-N-211-133002"},{"fundingName":"Aim for the Top University Plan"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006397","fundingName":"National Taiwan Normal University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008385","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Taiwan","grantNumber":"103J1A27"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Immunomagnetic Reduction Assay on Des-Gamma-Carboxy Prothrombin for Screening of Hepatocellular Carcinoma","sourcePdf":"tbme-chieh-2478845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0838S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7515129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7515129","articleId":"7273866","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273870,"authors":[{"name":"Antitza Dantcheva","affiliation":["STARS Team, Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7365556/7273870/dantc-2480381-small.gif","p":["Antitza Dantcheva received the Ph.D. degree in signal and image processing from Eurecom/Telecom ParisTech, France, in 2011.

This ancillary information includes personal attributes, such as gender, age, ethnicity, hair color, height, weight, and so on. Such attributes are known as soft biometrics and have applications in surveillance and indexing biometric databases. These attributes can be used in a fusion framework to improve the matching accuracy of a primary biometric system (e.g., fusing face with gender information), or can be used to generate qualitative descriptions of an individual (e.g., young Asian female with dark eyes and brown hair). The latter is particularly useful in bridging the semantic gap between human and machine descriptions of the biometric data. In this paper, we provide an overview of soft biometrics and discuss some of the techniques that have been proposed to extract them from the image and the video data. We also introduce a taxonomy for organizing and classifying soft biometric attributes, and enumerate the strengths and limitations of these attributes in the context of an operational biometric system. Finally, we discuss open research problems in this field. This survey is intended for researchers and practitioners in the field of biometrics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What Else Does Your Biometric Data Reveal?

In this paper, we pursue an entirely different angle to health information security, motivated by the insight that the human body itself is a rich source (acoustic, visual, and electromagnetic) of data. We propose a new class of information security attacks that exploit physiological information leakage, i.e., various forms of information that naturally leak from the human body, to compromise privacy. As an example, we demonstrate attacks that exploit acoustic leakage from the heart and lungs. The medical devices deployed within or on our bodies also add to natural sources of physiological information leakage, thereby increasing opportunities for attackers. Unlike previous attacks on medical devices, which target the wireless communication to/from them, we propose privacy attacks that exploit information leaked by the very operation of these devices. As an example, we demonstrate how the acoustic leakage from an insulin pump can reveal important information about its operation, such as the duration and dosage of insulin injection. Moreover, we show how an adversary can estimate blood pressure (BP) by capturing and processing the electromagnetic radiation of an ambulatory BP monitoring device.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2015.2478003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7558276/07273876.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2015.2478003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7558276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physiological Information Leakage: A New Frontier in Health Information Security","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273876/","displayDocTitle":"Physiological Information Leakage: A New Frontier in Health Information Security","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16282788","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273876/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"Division of Computer and Network Systems through the National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1219570"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physiological Information Leakage: A New Frontier in Health Information Security","sourcePdf":"tetc-mohsennia-2478003-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124154S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7558276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7558276","articleId":"7273876","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273884,"authors":[{"name":"Natalia Silberstein","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Natalia Silberstein received her B.A. degree in Computer Science (cum laude), B.A. degree in Mathematics (cum laude), M.Sc. degree in Applied Mathematics (summa cum laude), and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, in 2004, 2007, and 2011, respectively.

The concatenated coding scheme brings together a maximum rank distance code as an outer code and either a globally regenerating or a locally repairable code as an inner code. In addition, error resilience for combination of locally repairable codes with regenerating codes is considered. This concatenated coding system is designed to handle two different types of adversarial errors: the first type includes an adversary that can replace the content of an affected node only once; while the second type studies an adversary that is capable of polluting data an unbounded number of times. The paper establishes an upper bound on the resilience capacity for a locally repairable code. This paper also proves that the proposed concatenated coding approach attains the upper bound on the resilience capacity in the presence of the first type of adversary for both minimum storage regenerating codes and locally repairable codes. Further, this paper presents mechanisms that combine the presented concatenated coding scheme with subspace signatures to achieve error resilience for the second type of errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Correcting Regenerating and Locally Repairable Codes via Rank-Metric Codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2480848","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07273884.pdf","startPage":"5765","endPage":"5778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2480848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Error-Correcting Regenerating and Locally Repairable Codes via Rank-Metric Codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7273884/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524594","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Technion by the Fine Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Correcting Regenerating and Locally Repairable Codes via Rank-Metric Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-silberstein-2480848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095336S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7273884","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273887,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7273887/xiaoq-2480748-small.gif","p":["\n\nXiaoqian Li (M'11) was born in Hebei, China, in 1987.

The circulating current affects various aspects of MMC performance, such as power losses, capacitor voltage ripples, and the required current rating of semiconductors. Existing circulating current control methods can improve MMC performance in one aspect, but they may not implement the optimal performance in various aspects. Analytically analyzing how circulating current control affects MMC performance is essential. This paper proposes an improved steady-state analysis method that considers circulating current control. The influence of circulating current control is included by considering the effects of the second-harmonic component on reference voltages. Explicit analytical expressions for various electrical quantities can be derived, and the analytical calculation curves of some MMC performance indexes concerned under varying second-harmonic reference voltages can be obtained. Accordingly, the effects of circulating current control on MMC performance can be concluded, where a theoretical foundation for the accurate design of MMC parameters is provided. In addition, the obtained analytical calculation curves can be used to evaluate different circulating current control targets and find appropriate control targets to comprehensively improve MMC performance. Both simulation and experimental results verify the validity of the proposed steady-state analysis method and the corresponding conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2480748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07273887.pdf","startPage":"716","endPage":"727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2480748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Optimization of Circulating Current Control for Modular Multilevel Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273887/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Optimization of Circulating Current Control for Modular Multilevel Converter","volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697122","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273887/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51577101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Optimization of Circulating Current Control for Modular Multilevel Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-song-2480748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085919S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7273887","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273890,"authors":[{"name":"Wassim Hamidouche","affiliation":["IMAGE Group, Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Rennes, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7372356/7273890/hamid-2478705-small.gif","p":["Wassim Hamidouche (M\u201915) received the Engineering degree in computer science from University of Sciences and Technologies of Algiers, Bab Ezzouar, Algeria, in 2006, and the master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in signal and image processing from University of Poitiers, Poitiers, France, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","He started his research work on realistic physical layer and joint source-channel coding solutions, including image and video transmission over wireless channels.

These two extensions enable additional features not covered in the first version of the HEVC standard such as spatial, fidelity, bitdepth, and color gamut scalability, as well as stereoscopic and multiview representations. In this paper, we propose a software parallel decoder architecture for the HEVC standard and its multilayer extensions, including SHVC and MV-HEVC extensions. The decoder consists of multiple instances of the OpenHEVC decoder, one instance to decode each layer with a communication between dependent layers to perform inter-layer predictions. The proposed multilayer HEVC decoder is parallel friendly and supports both wavefront parallelism to simultaneously process adjacent rows of the frame and frame-based parallelism to decode a set of temporal and spatial frames in parallel. Moreover, the most time-consuming operation introduced in the SHVC extension, namely, the resampling of the inter-layer reference picture in spatial scalability, is optimized in single instruction multiple data for x86 platform. We assess the complexity of the multilayer HEVC decoder with respect to the simulcast configuration. The multilayer decoder decoding two SHVC layers introduces in average 40%-71% additional complexity compared with the single layer HEVC decoder. Moreover, the low level optimizations with a hybrid parallel processing solution enable a real-time decoding of 4Kp60 enhancement layer on a 6-core Intel i7 processor running at 3.4 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2478705","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7372356/07273890.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7372356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2478705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"169","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"4K Real-Time and Parallel Software Video Decoder for Multilayer HEVC Extensions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"4K Real-Time and Parallel Software Video Decoder for Multilayer HEVC Extensions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273890/","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7273890/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15689046","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Celtic-Plus","grantNumber":"H2B2VS"},{"fundingName":"Finland France, Spain, Switzerland, and Turkey"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"4K Real-Time and Parallel Software Video Decoder for Multilayer HEVC Extensions","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-hamidouche-2478705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135318S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7372356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7372356","articleId":"7273890","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7273899,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Hwan Hwang","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea","Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7348918/7273899/hwang-2476236-small.gif","p":["Jung-Hwan Hwang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

One is a feasibility check technique for the probabilistic constraints conducted only at the first design cycle. It identifies inactive constraints, which need not be considered after the next design cycles. The other is a reliability improvement scheme for slightly violated probabilistic constraints, which is performed at the end of iterative design cycles. When an obtained optimum is unsatisfactory to all probabilistic constraint conditions prescribed, the design point is slightly shifted toward a feasible design region by utilizing probabilistic information obtained.

A token based medium access mechanism is used in mm-wave WiNoC architectures to enable a distributed utilization of the available wireless bandwidth among multiple transmitters. However, on-chip wireless interconnects can suffer from high rates of failures due to challenges in design and manufacturing. Consequently, the token-passing mechanism can fail and significantly degrade the potential benefits of this novel interconnect technology. In this paper, we establish a cross-layer robust and failure-resistant design methodology for WiNoC architectures. By optimizing the WiNoC topology and complementing it with a robust token management scheme and error correction codes, we propose to design a failure-resistent WiNoC. Through system-level simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed design can mitigate the effect of various types of failures of the wireless fabric in WiNoC architectures without compromising the energy-efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2478439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2478439","startPage":"33","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/7294742/07273907.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Methodology for a Robust and Energy-Efficient Millimeter-Wave Wireless Network-on-Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design Methodology for a Robust and Energy-Efficient Millimeter-Wave Wireless Network-on-Chip","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15552528","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7273907/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1162123"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Methodology for a Robust and Energy-Efficient Millimeter-Wave Wireless Network-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"tmscs-ganguly-2478439-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06853S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7294742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7294742","articleId":"7273907","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7273910,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Wook Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Wook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37537424400"},{"name":"Byungsu Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea"],"firstName":"Byungsu","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085670909"},{"name":"K.

Particularly, the mix of random taxis and fixed-scheduled buses makes the delay components along a path dependent and hard to estimate. In this paper, to address the scalability and high-mobility issues, we introduce a store-and-forward framework for VANETs with extra storage using \u201cdrop boxes\u201d, which function similar to network routers. Next, we propose an optimal link strategy which is independent of the message arrival time and can be executed in a distributed manner. Then, we derive the expected path delay, considering the dependence of the delay components along the path, and propose the optimal routing strategy to minimize the expected path delay. Trace-driven simulations have been used to validate the rigorous analysis, and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategies, which result in a substantial delay reduction and a much higher delivery ratio when compared with the state-of-the-art solutions without drop boxes. The strategies can further improve the delay performance when compared with the over-simplified routing solutions which ignore the dependence of the delay components.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Minimization for Data Dissemination in Large-Scale VANETs with Buses and Taxis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile

One of the major problems of MAT-MI is the singularity problem and its numerical errors caused by singular MAT-MI acoustic sources at conductivity boundaries and interfaces. In order to achieve more computational accuracy, especially on the conductivity boundaries and interfaces of inclusions, we have developed a forward solver in MAT-MI to compute the forward problem with generalized finite-element method (GFEM) in this paper. The novelty of this paper relies on the first adaption of GFEM in MAT-MI computation. Using the solver, the distribution of the eddy current and the distribution of the acoustic source are accurately computed in the object with computer simulation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the forward solver in MAT-MI. In the forward solution, it is capable of achieving good accuracy and stability using our computation model with GFEM.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2480877","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7410156/07273934.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2480877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410156","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward Solver in Magnetoacoustic Tomography With Magnetic Induction by Generalized Finite-Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Forward Solver in Magnetoacoustic Tomography With Magnetic Induction by Generalized Finite-Element Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","isJournal":true,"externalId":"5100204","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786695","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7273934/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"E2013202238 and E2015202292"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City","grantNumber":"13JCQNJC14100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward Solver in Magnetoacoustic Tomography With Magnetic Induction by Generalized Finite-Element Method","sourcePdf":"tmag-xu-2480877-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059032S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7410156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7410156","articleId":"7273934","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273936,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7302100/7273936/7273936-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Yu received the B.S and M.S. degrees from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology at the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China.","He was a Research Intern with Web Search and Mining Group, Microsoft Research, Beijing, China, from 2013 to 2015.

With recent progress of DNN, almost all image classification tasks have achieved new records of accuracy. To extend the ability of DNN to image retrieval tasks, we proposed a unified DNN model for image-query similarity calculation by simultaneously modeling image and query in one network. The unified DNN is named the cross space mapping (CSM) model, which contains two parts, a convolutional part and a query-embedding part. The image and query are mapped to a common vector space via these two parts respectively, and image-query similarity is naturally defined as an inner product of their mappings in the space. To ensure good generalization ability of the DNN, we learn weights of the DNN from a large number of click-through logs which consists of 23 million clicked image-query pairs between 1 million images and 11.7 million queries. Both the qualitative results and quantitative results on an image retrieval evaluation task with 1000 queries demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553476","htmlLink":"/document/7273936/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning Cross Space Mapping via DNN Using Large Scale Click-Through Logs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472103"},{"fundingName":"Key Program","grantNumber":"61133003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Cross Space Mapping via DNN Using Large Scale Click-Through Logs","sourcePdf":"tmm-yu-2480340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077799S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7273936","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273941,"authors":[{"name":"Peiyao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peiyao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085741440"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"},{"name":"Chen Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Qian","id":"38244081400"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"},{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7273941","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":956},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Channel estimation","Uplink","Antennas","Complexity theory","MIMO","Contamination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","channel estimation","cochannel interference","MIMO communication","mobility management (mobile radio)","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location-aware channel estimation","pilot reuse scheme","cochannel time-division duplex mode","large antenna arrays","MBS","macrocell base stations","massive MIMO-HetNet","heterogeneous cellular network","massive multi-input multi-output systems","location-aware pilot assignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous network (HetNet)","location-aware pilot assignment","massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","pilot contamination"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) where the macrocell base stations (MBSs) are equipped with very large antenna arrays. Since such a combined massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and HetNet system operates in the co-channel time-division duplex mode, to mitigate the pilot contamination effect to channel estimation, the number of users that can be served simultaneously is limited by the available pilot resources in the conventional designs. We propose a pilot reuse scheme for massive MIMO-HetNet to increase the user capacity. Specifically, location-aware channel estimation is employed at the MBSs to mitigate the severe pilot contamination introduced by pilot reuse, and we propose a novel pilot assignment algorithm to reduce the interference in HetNets. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can support more users and increase both the uplink and the downlink sum-rate capacity, in comparison to the conventional scheme, particularly when the antenna number at the MBSs is sufficiently large.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2480965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions

paper, the effects of oscillator phase noise (PN) with arbitrary spectral characteristics on the self-interference (SI) cancelation capability of a full-duplex radio (FDR) transceiver are addressed, and design considerations for optimized phase-locked loop (PLL) design in FDR are given. This paper first presents a full-duplex transceiver model that inherently mitigates most of the phase-noise effects from the SI signal. The remaining effect of the PN is then analyzed, and closed-form expressions for the SI power are derived. In the simulations part, a practical PLL-type oscillator is used, which is based on the arbitrary mask phase-noise model. Analytical derivations are verified with the simulations, and the SI cancelation performance is thoroughly studied with various parameters. Design considerations are finally given for oscillator design in FDR transceivers, with the help of tangible parameters of the PLL-type oscillators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16210042","htmlLink":"/document/7273946/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design Specifications for Full-Duplex Radio Transceivers Under RF Oscillator Phase Noise With Arbitrary Spectral Shape","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Fellowship program"},{"fundingName":"KAKENHI","grantNumber":"25-03718"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004756","fundingName":"Emil Aaltonen Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"276378 and 259915"},{"fundingName":"Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design Specifications for Full-Duplex Radio Transceivers Under RF Oscillator Phase Noise With Arbitrary Spectral Shape","sourcePdf":"tvt-syrjala-2480338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074926S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7273946","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7273948,"authors":[{"name":"Guodong Liu","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Guodong Liu (S\u201910) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA, in 2014.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN.

The microgrid coordinates the energy consumption or production of its components, and trades electricity in both day-ahead and real-time markets to minimize its operating cost as a single entity. The bidding problem is challenging due to a variety of uncertainties, including power output of intermittent DG, load variation, and day-ahead and real-time market prices. A hybrid stochastic/robust optimization model is proposed to minimize the expected net cost, i.e., expected total cost of operation minus total benefit of demand. This formulation can be solved by mixed-integer linear programming. The uncertain output of intermittent DG and day-ahead market price are modeled via scenarios based on forecast results, while a robust optimization is proposed to limit the unbalanced power in real-time market taking account of the uncertainty of real-time market price. Numerical simulations on a microgrid consisting of a wind turbine, a photovoltaic panel, a fuel cell, a micro-turbine, a diesel generator, a battery, and a responsive load show the advantage of stochastic optimization, as well as robust optimization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidding Strategy for Microgrid in Day-Ahead Market Based on Hybrid Stochastic/Robust Optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2476669","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7361791/07273948.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2476669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7361791","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Bidding Strategy for Microgrid in Day-Ahead Market Based on Hybrid Stochastic/Robust Optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7273948/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15683459","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006130","fundingName":"Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006130","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy with the University of Tennessee (UT)-Battelle and conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and UT Knoxville","grantNumber":"DE-AC05-00OR 22725"},{"fundingName":"Engineering Research Center Shared Facilities of the Engineering Research Center Program of the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy under National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"EEC-1041877"},{"fundingName":"Center for Ultra-Wide-Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks (CURENT) Industry Partnership Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidding Strategy for Microgrid in Day-Ahead Market Based on Hybrid Stochastic/Robust Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsg-liu-2476669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098761S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7361791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"240","xplore-issue":"7361791","articleId":"7273948","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7273952,"authors":[{"name":"Basant K.

The proposed LUT optimization scheme offers a saving of 60% LUT content for block size 8 and still higher saving for larger block sizes over the conventional design approach. We also present here the design of a register-based LUT matrix for maximal sharing of LUT contents and full-parallel LUT-update operation. Based on the proposed design approach, we have derived a DA-based architecture for the BLMS ADF, which is scalable for larger block sizes as well as higher filter lengths. We find that the hardware complexity of the proposed structure increases less than proportionately with input block size and filter length. It offers a saving of 60% LUT-update per output and 59% LUT access per output over the recently proposed DA-based BLMS ADF structure for block size 8 and filter length 64. Besides, the proposed structure involves nearly 30% saving in the iteration period over the other for 16-bit coefficient word length. Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) synthesis result shows that the proposed structure for block size 8 offers a saving of 48% area-delay product (ADP) and 53% energy per sample (EPS) over the existing DA-based BLMS ADF structure on average for different filter lengths, and offers 30% higher sampling rate due to its shorter iteration period. Compared with the existing DA-based LMS ADF structure, the proposed structure involves 68% less ADP and $1.6 \\times $ less EPS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7456352/07273952.pdf","startPage":"1926","endPage":"1935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2472964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2472964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7456352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LUT Optimization for Distributed Arithmetic-Based Block Least Mean Square Adaptive Filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Least squares approximations","Optimization","Hardware","Color","Periodic structures","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","application specific integrated circuits","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LUT optimization","distributed arithmetic-based block least mean square adaptive filter","lookup tables","DA-based BLMS ADF","intra-iteration LUT","register-based LUT matrix for","application specific integrated circuit synthesis","area-delay product","ADP","energy per sample","EPS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filters (ADFs)","block least mean square (BLMS)","distributed arithmetic (DA)","LMS algorithm"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive filters (ADFs)","block least mean square (BLMS)","distributed arithmetic (DA)","LMS algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"LUT Optimization for Distributed Arithmetic-Based Block Least Mean Square Adaptive Filter","volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7273952/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935072","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LUT Optimization for Distributed Arithmetic-Based Block Least Mean Square Adaptive Filter","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mohanty-2472964-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077221S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7456352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7456352","articleId":"7273952","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273953,"authors":[{"name":"V\u00edtor Monteiro","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Electronics, Centro Algoritmi, University of Minho, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7430378/7273953/monte-2481005-small.gif","p":["V\u00edtor Monteiro (S'10) was born in Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal, in May 1984.

The vehicle-to-home (V2H) operation mode, where the EV can operate as a power source in isolated systems or as offline uninterruptible power supply to feed priority appliances of the home during power outages of the electrical grid, is presented in this paper and framed with the other operation modes. These five operation modes were validated through experimental results using a developed 3.6-kW bidirectional EV battery charger prototype, which was specially designed for these operation modes. This paper describes the developed EV battery charger prototype, detailing the power theory and the voltage and current control strategies used in the control system. This paper also presents experimental results for the various operation modes, both in steady state and during transients.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7430378/07273953.pdf","startPage":"1007","endPage":"1020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2481005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2481005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7430378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operation Modes for the Electric Vehicle in Smart Grids and Smart Homes: Present and Proposed Modes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power grids","Batteries","Battery chargers","Voltage control","Reactive power","DC-DC power converters","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","battery powered vehicles","smart power grids","uninterruptible power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle","operation modes","smart grids","smart homes","EV battery charger","EV adoption","grid-to-vehicle operation mode","G2V operation mode","V2G operation mode","vehicle-to-grid operation mode","vehicle-for-grid operation mode","V4G operation mode","offline uninterruptible power supply","power outages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bidirectional Battery Charger","Electric Vehicle","G2V \u2013 Grid-to-Vehicle","H2V \u2013 Home-to-Vehicle","Smart Grids","Smart Homes","V2G \u2013 Vehicle-to-Grid","V4G \u2013 Vehicle-for-Grid","V2H \u2013 Vehicle-to-Home"]},{"kwd":["Bidirectional battery charger","electric vehicle (EV)","grid-to-vehicle (G2V)","home-to-vehicle (H2V)","smart grids","smart homes","vehicle-for-grid (V4G)","vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","vehicle-to-home (V2H)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Operation Modes for the Electric Vehicle in Smart Grids and Smart Homes: Present and Proposed Modes","volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7273953/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15840223","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FCT-Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia","grantNumber":"PEst-UID/CEC/00319/2013"},{"fundingName":"FCT agency","grantNumber":"SFRH/BD/80155/2011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation Modes for the Electric Vehicle in Smart Grids and Smart Homes: Present and Proposed Modes","sourcePdf":"tvt-monteiro-2481005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116185S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7430378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"7430378","articleId":"7273953","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273956,"authors":[{"name":"Henrik Klessig","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7273956/kless-2480760-small.gif","p":["Henrik Klessig (M\u201912) received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, in 2012.

Moreover, the problem of (partly) limited capacity in time and space requires the joint treatment of spatio-temporal data traffic and intercell interference dynamics. Concerning this matter, we propose a performance evaluation framework, which is capable of estimating various cell-specific and user-specific key performance metrics considering the complex spatio-temporal interaction of traffic and interference dynamics. We provide methods for obtaining these metrics with low complexity, making the framework attractive to self-organizing network solutions for future (ultra)dense networks. We stress the framework's broad applicability and demonstrate the effects of internal flow and external interference dynamics on network performance under various conditions. In particular, we highlight the dominance of these dynamics over the impact of the speed of the variation of intercell interference, the scheduler, the file size distribution, and fast fading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15785897","htmlLink":"/document/7273956/","displayDocTitle":"A Performance Evaluation Framework for Interference-Coupled Cellular Data Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"government of the Free State of Saxony"},{"fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"31529/2794"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Performance Evaluation Framework for Interference-Coupled Cellular Data Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-klessig-2480760-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12893S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7273956","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273957,"authors":[{"name":"Swayambhoo Jain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7273957/sjain-2480392-small.gif","p":["Swayambhoo Jain received the Bachelor of Technology degree in electronics and communication engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, MN, USA, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.

In this paper, the impact of user pairing on the performance of two NOMA systems, i.e., NOMA with fixed power allocation (F-NOMA) and cognitive-radio-inspired NOMA (CR-NOMA), is characterized. For F-NOMA, both analytical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate that F-NOMA can offer a larger sum rate than orthogonal MA, and the performance gain of F-NOMA over conventional MA can be further enlarged by selecting users whose channel conditions are more distinctive. For CR-NOMA, the quality of service (QoS) for users with poorer channel conditions can be guaranteed since the transmit power allocated to other users is constrained following the concept of cognitive radio networks. Because of this constraint, CR-NOMA exhibits a different behavior compared with F-NOMA. For example, for the user with the best channel condition, CR-NOMA prefers to pair it with the user with the second best channel condition, whereas the user with the worst channel condition is preferred by F-NOMA.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2480766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2480766","startPage":"6010","endPage":"6023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07273963.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of User Pairing on 5G Nonorthogonal Multiple-Access Downlink Transmissions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Impact of User Pairing on 5G Nonorthogonal Multiple-Access Downlink Transmissions","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16209988","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7273963/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/L025272/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471302"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"111-2-14"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1456793 and ECCS-1343210"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of User Pairing on 5G Nonorthogonal Multiple-Access Downlink Transmissions","sourcePdf":"tvt-ding-2480766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112339S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"807","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7273963","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7273965,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7273965/jinli-2480850-small.gif","p":["Jing Li (S\u201908\u2013M\u201910) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees, all in telecommunications engineering, from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2003, 2006, and 2009, respectively.

In view of performance and complexity tradeoffs, two optimal and one suboptimal joint selection schemes are proposed and compared. In contrast to the optimal selection schemes, the suboptimal counterpart is characterized by its low overhead and implementation complexity. The performance of these selection strategies has been investigated by deriving the outage probability approximations in closed form. Moreover, the achievable diversity orders and the corresponding coding gains are derived through high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations of the outage probability. Our theoretical and simulation results show that the performance gap between the optimal and suboptimal schemes disappears for specific scenarios, which provides useful design guidelines for practical two-way relaying system.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2480850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","startPage":"980","endPage":"993","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07273965.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2480850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal and Suboptimal Joint Relay and Antenna Selection for Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Antennas","Joints","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antennas","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal joint relay","optimal joint relay","antenna selection","two-way amplify-and-forward relaying","AF relaying system","multiantenna source","single-antenna source","single-antenna relays","suboptimal joint selection schemes","closed form","signal-to-noise ratio approximations","SNR approximations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["two-way relaying","opportunistic relay","antenna selection","power allocation","outage probability"]},{"kwd":["Two-way relaying","opportunistic relay","antenna selection","power allocation","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and Suboptimal Joint Relay and Antenna Selection for Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273965/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7273965/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15785884","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372067"},{"fundingName":"National Major Specialized Project of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2013ZX03003001-003"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2014KJXX-49"},{"fundingName":"\u201c111\u201d project","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal and Suboptimal Joint Relay and Antenna Selection for Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","sourcePdf":"twc-li-2480850-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108379S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7273965","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7273966,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Hsiung Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7273966/tan-small.gif","p":["Kuang-Hsiung Tan received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical and electronic engineering from the Chung Cheng Institute of Technology (CCIT), National Defense\n University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2002, 2007, and 2013, respectively.","He has been a Member of the faculty at CCIT, where he is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of\n Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

Moreover, the ac/dc power converter and the dc/ac power inverter are mainly designed to control the mechanical rotor speed, dc-link voltage, and reactive power output of the SCIG system, respectively. Furthermore, since the varying active power outputs of the dc/ac power inverter seriously affect the tracking control of the dc-link voltage, a novel intelligent WPFNN controller is proposed to replace the traditional proportional-integral controller for the tracking control of the dc-link voltage in this study. In addition, the network structure and the online learning algorithm of the proposed WPFNN are described in detail.

Obtaining high-quality CSI requires a tradeoff between interference, outdatedness of CSI, and noise. Thus, the goal is to find an efficient pilot scheduling scheme that minimizes errors in the estimates. In this paper, we present the location aware training scheme (LATS) as simple yet efficient training technique. Assuming that the devices are aware of their location, LATS groups the devices into geographical segments and assigns a frequency reuse pattern to them. To identify the parameters of the scheme (segmentation and guard parameters, S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sub>\n and G\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sub>\n, respectively), we use the average normalized mean square error (NMSE) as a metric, which combines the effects of outdatedness, noise, and interference. We derive an approximation of the average NMSE based on statistics of the devices and LATS structure.

Furthermore, we consider some practical challenges in using location information and evaluate their effects on the scheme.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07273968.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2480774","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2480774","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273968","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Interference","Noise","Delays","Tin","Channel estimation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","approximation theory","frequency allocation","Long Term Evolution","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient channel state information acquisition","base-station controlled device-to-device networks","BS D2D networks","CSI outdatedness","interference","efficient pilot scheduling scheme","error minimization","location aware training scheme","LATS","geographical segments","frequency reuse pattern","average NMSE approximation","3GPP","Long-Term-Evolution-Advanced standardization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel State Information","CSI","pilot scheduling","acquisition","device to device","D2D","Ad Hoc"]},{"kwd":["Channel state information","CSI","pilot scheduling","acquisition","device to device","D2D","ad hoc"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Channel State Information Acquisition for Device-to-Device Networks","accessionNumber":"15785898","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7273968/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers"},{"fundingName":"Intel/Cisco/Verizon \u201dVideo Aware Wireless Networks (VAWN)\u201d"},{"fundingName":"\u201c5G\u201d program of Intel Corporate research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Channel State Information Acquisition for Device-to-Device Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-burghal-2480774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109252S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7273968","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7273969,"authors":[{"name":"Deli Qiao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7273969/dqiao-2480851-small.gif","p":["Deli Qiao received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.

The Maximum Constant Arrival Rates are characterized with the aid of the notion of effective capacity, based on which the spectral efficiency-bit energy tradeoff is analyzed in the low-SNR regime. The analysis is performed under two assumptions: 1) perfect channel side information (CSI) at receiver only and 2) perfect CSI at both the transmitter and receiver. It is proven that the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency is indeed the minimum bit energy. The expressions for the minimum bit energy and wideband slope are obtained. It is shown that the performances of the low-power and wideband regimes are the same, while the statistical queueing constraints have different behaviors. It is found that the minimum bit energy requirements increase as the statistical delay constraints become more stringent. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the minimum bit energy required is the same as that attained when only statistical queueing constraints are enforced in the wideband regime, while the bit energy increment is larger to achieve the same nonzero spectral efficiency. Overall, the impact upon the energy efficiency of statistical delay constraints is quantified.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2480851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07273969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2480851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","startPage":"994","endPage":"1007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Statistical Delay Constraints on the Energy Efficiency in Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Statistical Delay Constraints on the Energy Efficiency in Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15785855","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7273969/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172085"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Statistical Delay Constraints on the Energy Efficiency in Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-qiao-2480851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069479S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7273969","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273970,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7456352/7273970/wang-2467157-small.gif","p":["Ying Wang (M\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China, in 2014.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with ICT, CAS.

In particular, for the 3-D phase-change memory (PCM) well known for its high-amplitude programming current, IR-drop violation poses a serious threat that enforces a strict guard band of requesting concurrence, and consequently reduces the write throughput. This paper presents the implication of an IR-drop phenomenon in a 3-D PCM cube, and investigates IR-drop's impacts on write management in the PCM. From the obtained SPICE simulation results, we find that the issued writes have to meet the IR-drop constraint to be reliably processed, and then propose a PSI conscious write scheduler to improve the write performance within the constraint of the IR-drops and the power budget in the 3-D PCM cube. First, a Bloom-filter-based method is proposed to avoid the invalid write decisions for the PCM. Second, to support fine-grained write management in the cutting-edge PCM, we develop an inexpensive approach, weighted token assignment (WTA), to filter out PSI-unsafe write decisions by employing a support vector machine-based learning model. Last, a write reordering policy is proposed to cooperate with WTA and optimize the total write throughput for better memory performance. In the simulated hybrid main memory composed of both dynamic random access memory and 3-D PCM, the proposed scheduler significantly improves the write throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2467157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7456352/07273970.pdf","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7456352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2467157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSI Conscious Write Scheduling: Architectural Support for Reliable Power Delivery in 3-D Die-Stacked PCM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7273970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"PSI Conscious Write Scheduling: Architectural Support for Reliable Power Delivery in 3-D Die-Stacked PCM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273970/","publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15935061","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273970/","volume":"24","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61202056, 61376043, 61432017, 61176040, 61504153 and 61221062"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973)","grantNumber":"2011CB302503"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSI Conscious Write Scheduling: Architectural Support for Reliable Power Delivery in 3-D Die-Stacked PCM","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wang-2467157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084122S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7456352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7456352","articleId":"7273970","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7273972,"authors":[{"name":"Woohyuk Chang","affiliation":["Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7273972/chang-2480406-small.gif","p":["Woohyuk Chang (S'03\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, Korea, in 2001 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2003 and 2010, respectively.","He was a Senior Researcher with the Institute for Information Technology Convergence, KAIST, from December 2009 to November 2010.

It is assumed that secondary nodes are aware of the channel state information (CSI) of primary nodes and of how the primary nodes operate, whereas the primary nodes operate with no prior knowledge about the secondary nodes. We first propose a full-duplex relaying protocol for the cognitive radio (CR) network with a single relay node shared by both the primary and the secondary networks. In this case, the shared relay is assumed to have full CSI of the primary nodes and to know how the primary and secondary nodes operate. The proposed relaying protocol enables the secondary network to achieve nonzero rates without causing capacity loss at the primary network in a certain channel condition. Then, we also propose three half-duplex relaying protocols for the CR network with two relays, each of which is dedicated to the primary or the secondary network, respectively. It is shown that appropriate combinations of the proposed three half-duplex relaying protocols make it always possible for the secondary network to achieve nonzero rates without causing capacity loss at the primary network. Achievable rates of the proposed full- and half-duplex relaying protocols are evaluated through extensive computer simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed relaying protocols provide nonzero achievable rates of the secondary network over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16210006","htmlLink":"/document/7273972/","displayDocTitle":"On the Relaying Protocols Without Causing Capacity Loss at a Primary Node in Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2013R1A1A2A10004905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Relaying Protocols Without Causing Capacity Loss at a Primary Node in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-jung-2480406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095285S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7273972","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273974,"authors":[{"name":"Salim Eryigit","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Idea Teknoloji, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7273974/eryig-2480781-small.gif","p":["\n\nSalim Eryigit received the B.S. degree in industrial engineering and the \nM.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2003, \n2008, and 2014, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Research and Development Engineer with Idea Teknoloji, Istanbul.

We model cooperation among cognitive radios (CRs) as a function of social ties among CRs. In this social CRN , where CRs do not necessarily fulfill every cooperative sensing request, we focus on the cooperator set selection problem, i.e., in which CRs ask for cooperation so that the resulting throughput and sensing accuracy are maximized, subject to detection and false alarm probability constraints. For a single-channel scenario, we devise a multiobjective optimization model and obtain the solution using an evolutionary multiobjective algorithm. Our evaluations show that our solution is near optimal, in terms of throughput under legitimate operation, i.e., no malicious users, whereas it outperforms the expected-throughput-optimal scheme in the case of attackers. A numerical analysis demonstrates the robustness of our proposal with a slight loss in performance when the network is subject to common sensing attacks. In addition, our analysis underlines one significant drawback of existing works: assuming all CRs to be cooperative leads to a substantial overestimation of throughput capacity. Finally, to tackle the increasing complexity under a multichannel setting, we propose a heuristic for multichannel cooperative sensing for the considered social CRN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7273974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2015","volume":"65","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"16209981","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7273974/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Cooperator Set Selection in Social Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Turkish Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology","grantNumber":"SANTEZ 0410.STZ.2013-2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000544","fundingName":"Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University Research Fund (BAP)","grantNumber":"7437"},{"fundingName":"State Planning Organization of Turkey","grantNumber":"07K120610"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"WiFiUS 284807"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Cooperator Set Selection in Social Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-eryigit-2480781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103408S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7273974","onlineDate":"22 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7273975,"authors":[{"name":"Batu Krishna Chalise","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7273975/chali-2480867-small.gif","p":["Batu Krishna Chalise (SM'11) is currently a faculty with the Department of Electrical Engineering\nand Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA.

The system has only receive-side channel state information (CSI) and spatially correlated MIMO channels, and the receiver nodes observe spatially correlated noise. The transmit nodes employ orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs), whereas the receiver nodes employ optimum minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection. The SR protocol, which transmits via the relay only when the direct link between the source and destination is in outage, is compared with the fixed relaying (FR) protocol, which always uses the relay. By deriving novel asymptotic expressions of the outage probabilities, it is analytically shown that both protocols provide the same diversity gain. However, the coding gain (CG) of the SR protocol can be much better than that of the FR protocol. In particular, when all MIMO links have the same effective rank, irrespective of its value, the SR protocol provides better CG than the FR scheme if the target information rate is greater than ln\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(3) bits per channel use.

However, there is no guarantee that the reserve is deliverable for all scenarios (post-contingency states). One cheap way to improve reserve deliverability is to harness the flexibility of the transmission network. Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices are able to significantly improve the transfer capability. However, FACTS utilization is limited today due to the complexities these devices introduce to the DC optimal power flow problem (DCOPF). With a linear objective, the traditional DCOPF is a linear program (LP); when variable impedance based FACTS devices are taken into consideration, the problem becomes a nonlinear program (NLP). A reformulation of the NLP to a mixed integer linear program, for day-ahead corrective operation of FACTS devices, is presented in this paper. Engineering insight is then introduced to further reduce the complexity to an LP. Although optimality is not guaranteed, the simulation studies on the IEEE 118-bus system show that the method finds the globally optimal solution in 98.8% of the cases.

(3D) interconnect network implementation based on a modified Mesh-of-Trees (MoT) topology for FPGA architecture design. To obtain the optimal MoT-based interconnect structure, the routing architecture of the 2D MoT-based FPGA is modified to include long routing segments that span multiple switch blocks in every row and column. By adjusting the percentage of long wire and span, a 2.5D or 3D high density MoT FPGAs can be designed. To design 3D multi-stacked MoT-based FPGAs, the 2D MoT FPGA is cut into two or more equal sections by adjusting the long wire span. The long wire segments are realized using 3D through silicon via (TSV). To design 2.5D interposer-based multi-FPGAs, we increase the number of cuts and apply appropriate optimization models to scale down the number of long wires and horizontal inter-FPGA interposer wires. Using our 2.5/3D design and simulation CAD flow, we demonstrate the speed and area of 3D MoT-based FPGA architecture is improved by 54% and 41% respectively in comparison to 3D Mesh-based FPGA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486422","htmlLink":"/document/7274000/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient Mesh-of-Tree based interconnect architecture for high performance 3D FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient Mesh-of-Tree based interconnect architecture for high performance 3D FPGAs","confLoc":"Kula Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1A3172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108609S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7258096","isNumber":"7273987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7258096","xplore-issue":"7273987","articleId":"7274000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7274007,"authors":[{"name":"Ahilan Appathurai","affiliation":["Government College of Technology, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Ahilan","lastName":"Appathurai","id":"37085677643"},{"name":"P.

Once the number of turns decreases, the inductance value falls according to the injection level. The proposed solenoid inductor is simulated using a full-wave three-dimensional electromagnetic analysis tool, HFSS, for silicon substrate with copper metallic coil for different level of conductive liquid injection. Beside the cost-effective and easy manufacturing process, the simulation results demonstrate the 150% tuning range. The EM simulation results show a maximum quality factor of 85 at 3 GHz for proposed inductor. The minimum and maximum inductance values are 1.5 and 4 nH at 4 GHz for low-resistivity Silicon. This tunable inductor can be applied into reconfigurable radio-frequency circuits and matching networks to tune the operating frequency of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274014","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7258096/7273987/07274014.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","startPage":"90","endPage":"93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio-frequency silicon-based CMOS-compatible MEMS variable solenoid micro-fluidic inductor with Galinstan-based continuously-adjustable turn-ratio technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Radio-frequency silicon-based CMOS-compatible MEMS variable solenoid micro-fluidic inductor with Galinstan-based continuously-adjustable turn-ratio technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274014/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274014/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15486411","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio-frequency silicon-based CMOS-compatible MEMS variable solenoid micro-fluidic inductor with Galinstan-based continuously-adjustable turn-ratio technique","confLoc":"Kula Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"2B3161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054713S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7258096","isNumber":"7273987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7258096","xplore-issue":"7273987","articleId":"7274014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7274019,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Zhou","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085610456"},{"name":"Xueyan Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xueyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085632037"},{"name":"Zhongdong Qi","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhongdong","lastName":"Qi","id":"38067501700"},{"name":"Zhuwei Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhuwei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085620395"},{"name":"Qiang Zhou","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37274718000"},{"name":"Yici Cai","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yici","lastName":"Cai","id":"37277094600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7495-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7494-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7274019","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":919},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274019","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Training","Wires","Feature extraction","Predictive models","Accuracy","Pins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","network routing","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accurate detailed routing routability prediction","routability-driven placement","forecasting routing problems","global routing","supervised learning","placement routing","multivariate adaptive regression","well-trained model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["placement","routability","detailed routing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274019","pdfPath":"/iel7/7258096/7273987/07274019.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","startPage":"119","endPage":"122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An accurate detailed routing routability prediction model in placement","abstract":"Routability is one of the primary objectives in placement. There have been many researches on forecasting routing problems and improving routability in placement but no perfect solution is found. Most traditional routability-driven placers aim to improve global routing result, but true routability lies in detailed routing. Predicting detailed routing routability in placement is extremely difficult due to the complexity and uncertainty of routing. In this paper, we propose a new detailed routing routability prediction model based on supervised learning. After extracting key features in placement and detailed routing, multivariate adaptive regression is performed to train the connection between these two stages. Using a well-trained model, most design rule violations after detailed routing can be foreseen in placement stage. Experiments show that our average prediction accuracy is 79.8%, which is comparable with other state-of-art routability estimation techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274019/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15486402","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274019/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An accurate detailed routing routability prediction model in placement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accurate detailed routing routability prediction model in placement","confLoc":"Kula Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3A5142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046102S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7258096","isNumber":"7273987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7258096","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7273987","articleId":"7274019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7274021,"authors":[{"name":"Hua-Xuan Li","affiliation":["EE Dept., National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hua-Xuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085497337"},{"name":"Hua-Cheng Fu","affiliation":["EE Dept., National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hua-Cheng","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085712278"},{"name":"Shi-Yu Huang","affiliation":["EE Dept., National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shi-Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085489299"},{"name":"Jin-Cheng Jiang","affiliation":["EE Dept., National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Cheng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085762381"},{"name":"Ding-Ming Kwai","affiliation":["ICL, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ding-Ming","lastName":"Kwai","id":"37085493155"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Chou","affiliation":["ICL, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Chou","id":"37085497813"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7495-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7494-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7274021","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Through-silicon vias","Clocks","Threshold voltage","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit testing","oscillators","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient timing failure","power delivery network","dynamic voltage-drop","RO-based methods","manufacturing test session","scalable architecture","RO based monitors","ring-oscillator","test method","signal transmission","3D IC","power-delivery TSV","time 1 ns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TSV","power delivery","Defect","Ring Oscillator","Voltage-Drop","Monitoring"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274021","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7258096/7273987/07274021.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274021","doi":"10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273987","publicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing power-delivery TSVs","abstract":"Many TSVs in a 3D IC are not used for signal transmission but for power delivery. Techniques needed to detect them have not been studied in-depth in the literature. In this paper, we present a test method for power-delivery TSVs, by embedding ring-oscillator (RO) based monitors (in a scalable architecture) to detect if there is any excessive voltage-drop at the end of any TSV during a manufacturing test session. One key feature as opposed to previous RO-based methods is that our approach is able to detect the worst-case dynamic voltage-drop (occurring in a very short period of time such as 1ns), rather than just the average voltage-drop over a long period of time. This is essential in order to detect small defects inside the power delivery network. These defects, if not detected, could set off a transient timing failure when the IC is operated in a system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274021/","conferenceDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15486421","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274021/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Testing power-delivery TSVs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing power-delivery TSVs","confLoc":"Kula Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3B2188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06347S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7258096","isNumber":"7273987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7258096","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7273987","articleId":"7274021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":7274023,"authors":[{"name":"Pranab Roy","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Pranab","lastName":"Roy","id":"37958578500"},{"name":"Mriganka Chakraborty","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Mriganka","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37085427636"},{"name":"Aatreyi Bal","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Aatreyi","lastName":"Bal","id":"37085428861"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37085592218"},{"name":"Parthasarathi Dasgupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of management Calcutta, India"],"firstName":"Parthasarathi","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37288667500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7495-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7494-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7274023","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"abstract":"Digital Microfluidic Biochips, a promising platform for Lab-on-chip systems are capable of automated biochemical analysis targeted for medical diagnostics and other biochemical applications.

We propose a DMFB design capable of executing multiple Bioassays selectively based on prior detection of results of already executed protocols at previous timestamps. We propose specified detection analyzers to be integrated with photodiodes preplaced at dedicated detection sites and a centralized memory to decide on the predefined signal set for a given execution sequence.

The realization of IoT requires an enormous amount of sensor nodes to acquire inputs from the connected objects. Due to the lightweight nature of these sensors, constraints emerge in the form of limited power supply and area for the implementation of information security mechanism. To ensure security in the data transmitted by these sensors, lightweight cryptographic solutions are required. In this work, our goal is to implement a compact PRESENT cipher onto a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. Our proposed design uses an 8-bit datapath to reduce hardware size. Instead of a traditional look-up table (LUT) based S-Box, we have implemented a Boolean S-Box through Karnaugh mapping. Further factorization is also done to reduce the size of the Boolean S-Box. As a result, we have achieved the smallest FPGA implementation of the PRESENT cipher to date, requiring only 62 slices on the Virtex-5 XC5VLX50 platform. Our design also features a respectable throughput of 51.32 Mbps at the maximum frequency of 236.574 MHz.","publicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7258096/7273987/07274024.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact FPGA implementation of PRESENT with Boolean S-Box","doi":"10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Compact FPGA implementation of PRESENT with Boolean S-Box","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486414","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274024/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact FPGA implementation of PRESENT with Boolean S-Box","confLoc":"Kula Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"3B5144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079589S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7258096","isNumber":"7273987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7258096","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7273987","articleId":"7274024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7274025,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To improve DMFB reliability, the key is to know the possible points of failure of its electrode cells. In this paper, a novel test methodology is introduced to monitor the health of the DMFB by classifying its individual cells into weak, faulty and fault-free. The emphasis is on identifying physically degraded cells in the DMFB array and reducing their over-use, thus saving those cells from becoming faulty during operation. Degradation in cell health is measured by the change in its capacitance via a capacitance measurement circuit that can be integrated with the DMFB. The paper also presents the circuit to classify the cells as weak, faulty and fault free, implemented using 180nm technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7258096/7273987/07274032.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"191","publicationTitle":"2015 6th Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","doi":"10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACQED.2015.7274032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273987","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On enhancing the reliability of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFB) through electrode cells health classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Capacitance","Electrodes","Degradation","Capacitance measurement","Dielectrics","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","biomedical electrodes","capacitance measurement","capacitive sensors","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidic biochips","electrode cells health classification","physically degraded cells","DMFB array","capacitance measurement circuit","size 180 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliability","Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB)","Testing","Capacitive sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"On enhancing the reliability of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFB) through electrode cells health classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274032/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486394","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On enhancing the reliability of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFB) through electrode cells health classification","confLoc":"Kula Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"4B2154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068531S","chronDate":"4-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7258096","isNumber":"7273987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7258096","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7273987","articleId":"7274032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7274179,"authors":[{"name":"Lauren J.

Associative computing with ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) holds the potential to address both problems in a wide range of data intensive workloads. Power dissipation is reduced by eliminating instruction processing and data movement overheads present in a purely RAM-based system. Bandwidth demand is lowered by processing data directly on the TCAM chip, thereby decreasing off-chip traffic. Unfortunately, existing SRAM-based TCAM cells are more than 90 times larger than a DRAM cell at the same technology node, which limits the capacity of commercially available TCAMs to a few megabytes. This article examines the integration of gigascale TCAM systems based on resistive memories within a general-purpose computing platform. TCAM density is improved by novel, resistive memory cells that exploit phase change and spin-toque transfer magnetoresistive RAM technologies. TCAM chips are organized into a DDR3-compatible DIMM and are accessed through a software library with zero modifications to the processor or the motherboard. The proposed TCAM systems achieve average speedups of 3 to 4.5 times and average energy reductions of 5 to 8 times as compared to a conventional RAM-based system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274248/","volume":"35","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7274248/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15557969","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resistive Ternary Content Addressable Memory Systems for Data-Intensive Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resistive Ternary Content Addressable Memory Systems for Data-Intensive Computing","sourcePdf":"mmi2015050062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053505S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"40","isNumber":"7310924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7310924","articleId":"7274248","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":7274270,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlu Wang","affiliation":["Li-Fi R&D Center, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Yunlu Wang received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunication\n engineering from the Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2011, the M.Sc. degree in\n digital communication and signal processing from the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K., in 2013, and the M.Sc.\n degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Beihang University, China.

An additional tier of very small Li-Fi attocells which utilize the visible light spectrum, offers a significant increase in the wireless data throughput in an indoor environment, while at the same time providing room illumination. Importantly, there is no interference between Li-Fi and Wi-Fi. A Li-Fi attocell covers a significantly smaller area than a Wi-Fi access point (AP). This means that even with a moderate user movement a large number of handover between Li-Fi attocells can occur, and this compromises the system throughput. Dynamic load balancing (LB) can mitigate this issue so that the quasi-static users are served by Li-Fi attocells, while moving users are served by a Wi-Fi AP. However, due to the user movement, local overload situations may occur which prevent handover, leading to a lower throughput. This research studies LB in a hybrid Li-Fi/Wi-Fi network by taking into account user mobility and handover signalling overheads. Furthermore, a dynamic LB scheme is proposed, where the utility function considers system throughput and fairness. In order to better understand the handover effect on the LB, the service areas of different APs are studied, and the throughput of each AP by employing the proposed LB scheme is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2480969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2480969","startPage":"4671","endPage":"4682","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7286894/07274270.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Load Balancing With Handover in Hybrid Li-Fi and Wi-Fi Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Load Balancing With Handover in Hybrid Li-Fi and Wi-Fi Networks","volume":"33","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15500105","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274270/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"},{"fundingName":"Established Career Fellowship","grantNumber":"EP/K008757/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Load Balancing With Handover in Hybrid Li-Fi and Wi-Fi Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-wang-2480969-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090077S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7286894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"7286894","articleId":"7274270","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7274271,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274271/yxiao-2481204-small.gif","p":["Yong Xiao (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2012.

We introduce a dynamic energy trading framework that allows the EHDs to transfer and trade their harvested energy with each other. The EHDs are divided into two groups: seller EHDs that can harvest more energy than they can use, and buyer EHDs that cannot harvest sufficient energy to support their required communication services. In the proposed framework, the role of each EHD as a seller EHD or a buyer EHD as well as the amount of energy that each EHD can buy or sell to others change over time. Each EHD cannot observe complete information regarding the harvested energy or the number of data packets transmitted by other EHDs. We introduce a simple energy trading scheduling protocol for the EHDs to discover their nearby EHDs and establish energy trading links with each other. We formulate a new game theoretic model called stochastic energy trading game to analyze the dynamic energy trading among EHDs in a stochastic environment. We derive an optimal energy-trading policy for each EHD to sequentially optimize its decisions. We prove that the proposed policy can achieve a stable and optimal sequence of matchings between buyer and seller EHDs. We present numerical results to compare our proposed energy trading policy with an existing transmit packet scheduling approach, under various network settings and conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15602353","htmlLink":"/document/7274271/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Energy Trading for Energy Harvesting Communication Networks: A Stochastic Energy Trading Game","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1456921, CNS-1443917, ECCS-1405121, ECCS-1547201 and NSFC-61428101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland","grantNumber":"10/IN.1/I3007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Energy Trading for Energy Harvesting Communication Networks: A Stochastic Energy Trading Game","sourcePdf":"jsac-xiao-2481204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138565S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274271","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7274272,"authors":[{"name":"Esequiel da V.

The amount of energy captured from a wind energy conversion system (WECS) depends not only on the prevailing wind at the site, but also on the control strategy used for the WECS. Modeling, control and simulation of a wind turbine conversion system connected to an isolated load are proposed. The wind turbine being considered a variable speed turbine connected to a gear box to move a three phase wound rotor synchronous generator. The variable frequency energy produced by the generator is converted to the 50 Hz power system energy by a full power AC/DC/AC electronic converter. The maximum output power at every wind speed is achieved by selecting a certain inverter modulation index using proportional-integral controller which uses DC link power as feedback signal. The controller gains (Kp and Ki) are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SASG.2014.7274278","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2014 Saudi Arabia Smart Grid Conference (SASG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASG.2014.7274278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274273","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Saudi Arabia Smart Grid Conference (SASG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259600/7274273/07274278.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum power point tracking of a wind turbine driven by synchronous generator connected to an isolated load using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274278/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Maximum power point tracking of a wind turbine driven by synchronous generator connected to an isolated load using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274278/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15486434","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum power point tracking of a wind turbine driven by synchronous generator connected to an isolated load using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"B106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059261S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7259600","isNumber":"7274273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259600","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7274273","articleId":"7274278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7274314,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongxiang Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K., U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274314/zhwei-2481211-small.gif","p":["Zhongxiang Wei (S\u201915) received the M.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2013.

We develop an opportunistic relaying mode selection scheme, where FD relaying with one-stage self-interference cancellation (passive suppression) or two-stage self-interference cancellation (passive suppression + analog cancellation) or HD relaying is opportunistically selected, together with transmission power adaptation, to maximize the EE with given channel gains. A low-complexity joint mode selection and EE optimization algorithm are proposed. We show a counter-intuitive finding that with a relatively loose maximum transmission power constraint, FD relaying with two-stage self-interference cancellation is preferable to both FD relaying with one-stage self-interference cancellation and HD relaying, resulting in a higher optimized EE. A full range of power consumption sources is considered to rationalize our analysis. The effects of imperfect self-interference cancellation at relay, drain efficiency, and static circuit power on EE are investigated.

The installation of systems based on wireless networks can play a key role in the extension of the smart grid toward smart homes, that can be deemed as one of the most important components of smart grids. In fact, monitoring and control applications, energy harvesting, and innovative metering methodologies through smart wireless devices are becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel energy management approach for smart homes that combines a wireless network, based on bluetooth low energy (BLE), for communication among home appliances, with a home energy management (HEM) scheme. The proposed approach addresses the impact of standby appliances and high-power rating loads in peak hours to the energy consumption charges of consumers. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is efficient in terms of reducing peak load demand and electricity consumption charges with an increase in the comfort level of consumers.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07274316.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","startPage":"2988","endPage":"2996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Energy Management Approach for Smart Homes Using Bluetooth Low Energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Energy Management Approach for Smart Homes Using Bluetooth Low Energy","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602320","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274316/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Energy Management Approach for Smart Homes Using Bluetooth Low Energy","sourcePdf":"jsac-collotta-2481203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070592S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274316","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274317,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim Bedeer","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia (UBC), Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274317/bedee-2481207-small.gif","p":["Ebrahim Bedeer (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt, in 2002 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Memorial University, St. Johns, NL, Canada, in 2014, all in electrical engineering.

More specifically, we assign subcarriers and allocate powers for mobile and relay stations in order to maximize the worst-EE, i.e., to maximize the EE of the mobile station (MS) with the lowest EE value, subject to MSs transmit power, relay station (RS) transmit power, and MSs quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The formulated primal max-min optimization problem is nonconvex fractional mixed integer nonlinear program, i.e., NP-hard to solve. We provide a novel optimization framework that studies the structure of the primal problem and prove that the dual min-max optimization problem attains the same optimal solution of the primal problem. Additionally, we propose a modified Dinkelbach algorithm, named dual Dinkelbach, to achieve the optimal solution of the dual problem in a polynomial time complexity. We further exploit the structure of the obtained optimal solution and develop a low complexity suboptimal heuristic. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to improve the network performance in terms of fairness between MSs, worst-EE, and average network transmission rate when compared to traditional schemes that maximize the EE of the whole network. Presented results also show that the suboptimal heuristic balances the achieved performance and the computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on

In such scenarios, the lifetime of the wireless sensor network (WSN) is a major concern, given that sensor node replacement is generally inconvenient and costly. In this paper, a compressive sensing-based scheduling scheme is proposed that conserves energy by activating only a small subset of sensor nodes in each timeslot to sense and transmit. Compressive sensing introduces a cardinality constraint that makes the scheduling optimization problem particularly challenging. Taking advantage of the network topology imposed by the IoT water monitoring scenario, the scheduling problem is decomposed into simpler subproblems, and a dynamic-programming-based solution method is proposed. Based on the proposed method, a solution algorithm is derived, whose complexity and energy-wise performance are investigated. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is characterized and its performance is evaluated numerically via an IoT emulator of water distribution networks. The analytical and numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of energy consumption, network lifetime, and robustness to sensor node failures. It is argued that the derived solution approach is general and it can be potentially applied to more IoT scenarios such as WSN scheduling in smart cities and intelligent transport systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07274320.pdf","startPage":"2997","endPage":"3010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Sensor Activation for Water Distribution Networks Based on Compressive Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Green communications","Wireless sensor networks","Distributed processing","Energy consumption","Sensors","Compressed sensing","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","dynamic programming","Internet of Things","scheduling","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient sensor activation","water distribution networks","compressive sensing","Internet-of-Things","IoT","wireless sensor network","WSN","sensor node replacement","cardinality constraint","scheduling optimization problem","network topology","IoT water monitoring","dynamic programming","sensor node failures","WSN scheduling","intelligent transport systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy balancing","energy efficiency","water distribution networks","compressive sensing"]},{"kwd":["Energy balancing","energy efficiency","water distribution networks","and compressive sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Sensor Activation for Water Distribution Networks Based on Compressive Sensing","volume":"33","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7274320/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602341","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Wireless@KTH Seed Project LTE-based Water Monitoring Networks"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Sensor Activation for Water Distribution Networks Based on Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"jsac-du-2481199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150091S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274320","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274323,"authors":[{"name":"Oner Orhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274323/orhan-2481206-small.gif","p":["Oner Orhan (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Turkey, in 2010.

Compared with their battery-operated counterparts, the coupling of energy and data causality constraints with half-duplex relay operation makes it challenging to operate such networks. In this paper, a throughput maximization problem for energy harvesting two-hop networks with decode-and-forward half-duplex relays is investigated. For a system with two parallel relays, various combinations of the following four transmission modes are considered: broadcast from the source, multiaccess from the relays, and successive relaying phases I and II. Optimal transmission policies for one and two parallel relays are studied under the assumption of noncausal knowledge of energy arrivals and finite size relay data buffers. The problem is formulated using a convex optimization framework, which allows for efficient numerical solutions and helps identify important properties of optimal policies. Numerical results are presented to provide throughput comparisons and to investigate the impact of multiple relays, size of relay data buffers, transmission modes, and energy harvesting on the throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07274323.pdf","startPage":"2658","endPage":"2670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Harvesting Two-Hop Communication Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Energy harvesting","Throughput","Batteries","Convex functions","Green communications","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","decode and forward communication","energy harvesting","frequency hop communication","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting two-hop communication networks","data causality constraints","half-duplex relay operation","throughput maximization problem","decode-and-forward half-duplex relays","optimal transmission policies","parallel relays","convex optimization","multiple relays","relay data buffers","transmission modes"]},{"kwd":["Diamond relay channel","energy harvesting","offline power optimization","throughput maximization","two-hop communication networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Harvesting Two-Hop Communication Networks","volume":"33","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7274323/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602358","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NYU WIRELESS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Harvesting Two-Hop Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-orhan-2481206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112958S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274323","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274324,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Arafa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274324/arafa-2481200-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Arafa (S\u201913) received the B.Sc. degree (Highest Hons.) in electrical engineering from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2010, and the M.Sc. degree in wireless communications from Nile University, Giza Governorate, Egypt, in July 2012.

In our setting, receivers, in addition to transmitters, rely solely on energy harvested from nature, and need to spend some energy in order to decode their intended packets. We model the decoding energy as an increasing convex function of the rate of the incoming data. In this setting, in addition to the traditional energy causality constraints at the transmitters, we have the decoding causality constraints at the receivers, where energy spent by the receiver for decoding cannot exceed its harvested energy. We first consider the point-to-point single-user problem where the goal is to maximize the total throughput by a given deadline subject to both energy and decoding causality constraints. We show that decoding costs at the receiver can be represented as generalized data arrivals at the transmitter, and thereby moving all system constraints to the transmitter side. Then, we consider several multiuser settings. We start with a two-hop network where the relay and the destination have decoding costs, and show that separable policies, where the transmitter's throughput is maximized irrespective of the relay's transmission energy profile, are optimal. Next, we consider the multiple access channel (MAC) and the broadcast channel (BC) where the transmitters and the receivers harvest energy from nature, and characterize the maximum departure region. In all multiuser settings considered, we decompose our problems into inner and outer problems. We solve the inner problems by exploiting the structure of the particular model, and solve the outer problems by water-filling algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07274324.pdf","startPage":"2611","endPage":"2625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Policies for Wireless Networks With Energy Harvesting Transmitters and Receivers: Effects of Decoding Costs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Policies for Wireless Networks With Energy Harvesting Transmitters and Receivers: Effects of Decoding Costs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274324/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15602349","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274324/","volume":"33","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS 13-14733, CCF 14-22111 and CCF 14-22129"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Policies for Wireless Networks With Energy Harvesting Transmitters and Receivers: Effects of Decoding Costs","sourcePdf":"jsac-ulukus-2481200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111596S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274324","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7274329,"authors":[{"name":"Alber Filba-Martinez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7274329/filba-2480753-small.gif","p":["\n\nAlber Filba-Martinez (S'13) was born in Matar\u00f3, Spain.

Finally, a simple and practical specific modulation strategy is provided, resembling the optimum solutions.

To this end, we first formulate the energy-efficient cooperative transmission (eCotrans) problem for SWIPT in clustered wireless sensor networks as a non-convex constrained optimization problem. Then, by exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, we develop a distributed iteration algorithm for power allocation, power splitting and relay selection to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We find that power splitting ratio plays an imperative role in relay selection. Our simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can converge within a few iterations and the numerical analysis provides practical insights into the effect of various system parameters, such as the number of relay nodes, the inter-cluster distance and the maximum transmission power allowance, on energy efficiency and average harvested power.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2478782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2478782","startPage":"4405","endPage":"4417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07274335.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Tfor Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Tfor Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"63","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15676716","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274335/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61170248, 61373179, 61373178 and 61402381"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Leading Talent Promotion Project of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2013kjrc-ljrccj40001"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XDJK2013A018, XDJK2013C094 and 2362014XK12"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Tfor Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yang-2478782-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132524S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7274335","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7274341,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoning Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274341/zhang-2481202-small.gif","p":["Xiaoning Zhang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2002, 2005, and 2007, respectively.

Although traditional commonly used multiobjective optimization methods can yield a Pareto efficient solution, they need to construct an aggregate objective function (AOF) or model one objective as a constraint in the optimization problem formulation. As a result, it is difficult to achieve a fair tradeoff among all objectives. Accordingly, we induce a Nash bargaining framework, which treats the two objectives as two virtual players in a game theoretic model, who negotiate how traffic should be routed to optimize both objectives. During the negotiation, each of them announces its performance threat value to reduce its cost, so the model is regarded as a threat value game. Our analysis shows that no agreement can be achieved if each player sets its threat value selfishly. To avoid such a negotiation break-down, we modify the threat value game to have a repeated process and design a mechanism to not only guarantee an agreement, but also generate a fair solution. Finally, to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed framework, we implement it into two multiobjective optimization cases for network green routing. The first case is load balancing and energy efficiency optimization for intradomain routing, and the second one is the energy efficiency optimization of two domains for interdomain routing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"33","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602342","htmlLink":"/document/7274341/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization for Green Network Routing in Game Theoretical Perspective","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2013CB329103"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61201129, 91438117, 61301153 and 61271165"},{"fundingName":"Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization for Green Network Routing in Game Theoretical Perspective","sourcePdf":"jsac-zhang-2481202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095386S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274341","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274356,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["Yangzhou University, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7274356/yang-2480968-small.gif","p":["\n\nJing Yang (S'09\u2013M'13) was born in Tai'an, China, in 1982.

In order to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of primary networks, both the maximum tolerable peak interference power Q at the primary users (PUs) and the maximum allowable transmit power V at the secondary users (SUs) are considered to constrain transmit power at the cognitive transmitters. For integer-valued fading parameters, a closed-form lower bound for the outage probability (OP) of the considered networks is obtained. Moreover, assuming arbitrary-valued fading parameters, the lower bound in integral form for the OP is derived. In order to obtain further insights into the OP performance, asymptotic expressions for the OP at high SNRs are derived, from which the diversity/coding gains and the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) of the secondary network can be readily deduced. It is shown that the diversity gain and the DMT are solely determined by the fading parameters of the secondary network, whereas the primary network only affects the coding gain. The derived results include several others available in previously published studies as special cases, such as those for Nakagami-m fading channels. In addition, performance evaluation results have been obtained by Monte Carlo computer simulations, which have verified the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Hop Cognitive Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Networks Over - Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2480968","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07274356.pdf","startPage":"6290","endPage":"6300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2480968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Hop Cognitive Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Networks Over <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta-\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula> Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7274356/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16209993","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301111/61472343"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M56074"},{"fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415/14/22"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Hop Cognitive Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Networks Over <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta-\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2480968-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137269S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7274356","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274358,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Yu Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cheng Shiu University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7274358/chan-small.gif","p":["Shun-Yu Chan was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1959.

This investigation was used to develop and validate an automated method to segment livers in CT images. The proposed framework consists of three steps: 1) preprocessing; 2) initialization; and 3) segmentation. In the first step, a statistical shape model is constructed based on the principal component analysis and the input image is smoothed using curvature anisotropic diffusion filtering. In the second step, the mean shape model is moved using thresholding and Euclidean distance transformation to obtain a coarse position in a test image, and then the initial mesh is locally and iteratively deformed to the coarse boundary, which is constrained to stay close to a subspace of shapes describing the anatomical variability. Finally, in order to accurately detect the liver surface, deformable graph cut was proposed, which effectively integrates the properties and inter-relationship of the input images and initialized surface. The proposed method was evaluated on 50 CT scan images, which are publicly available in two databases Sliver07 and 3Dircadb. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was effective and accurate for detection of the liver surface.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Liver Segmentation Based on Shape Constraints and Deformable Graph Cut in CT Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2481326","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07274362.pdf","startPage":"5315","endPage":"5329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2481326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Liver Segmentation Based on Shape Constraints and Deformable Graph Cut in CT Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7274362/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15499165","pubMedId":"26415173","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"81371629, 61401293, 61401294, 81401472 and 81401451"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"14KJB510032"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB748600"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Liver Segmentation Based on Shape Constraints and Deformable Graph Cut in CT Images","sourcePdf":"tip-xiang-2481326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166678S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7274362","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274365,"authors":[{"name":"Motoki Sato","affiliation":["Engineering Research Division, Toyodenki Seizo, Yokohama, Japan","Department of Advanced Energy, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7274365/sato-small.gif","p":["Motoki Sato (M'12) received the M.E. degree from the Nagaoka\n University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan, in 2005.

A conventional IWM is powered from a battery aboard the vehicle via cables. Since power cables and signal cables of an IWM are exposed to harsh environments, they can possibly become disconnected by high acceleration or vibration. In order to overcome this problem, the wireless-in wheel motor (W-IWM) has been proposed. The risk of disconnection would disappear if the cables of the IWM are removed. One way to implement wireless power transfer is by utilizing the magnetic resonance coupling method. However, motion of the W-IWM, and thus, a misalignment between the wheel and the vehicle, leads to variations in the secondary-side voltage provided. To account for this, this paper discusses two new control methods. One proposed method maintains the secondary voltage using a hysteresis comparator. The other proposed method estimates the secondary inverter output power, applying it to a feedforward controller in order to keep the secondary dc-link voltage constant. Experimental results show that these methods can drive a W-IWM effectively with high efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2481182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2481182","startPage":"5270","endPage":"5278","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7394209/07274365.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Wireless In-Wheel Motor Using Magnetic Resonance Coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"Development of Wireless In-Wheel Motor Using Magnetic Resonance Coupling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","volume":"31","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274365/","accessionNumber":"15754642","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274365/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001700","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology","grantNumber":"26249061"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Wireless In-Wheel Motor Using Magnetic Resonance Coupling","sourcePdf":"tpel-sato-2481182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145239S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7274365","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":7274367,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Baneira","affiliation":["Applied Power Electronics Research Group (APET), University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7274367/banei-small.gif","p":["Fernando Baneira received the M.Sc.\u00a0degree from the University\n of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2013, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D.\u00a0degree in the Applied Power\n Electronics Technology Research Group.","Since 2014, he has been with the Applied Power Electronics Technology Research Group, University of Vigo.

As in three-phase machines, it is important to provide thermal protection, in order to prevent reduction of the lifetime. Proposals specifically targeted to dual three-phase machines for estimating the stator winding temperature, and thus, avoiding the installation of thermal sensors, have not been reported so far. Concerning three-phase machines, previous publications have proposed techniques based on injecting a dc signal for estimating the stator winding temperature. However, a certain torque ripple is caused during the injection period, giving rise to a tradeoff between the magnitude of such ripple and the accuracy of the temperature estimation. This paper presents a method based on dc-signal injection for stator winding temperature estimation in dual three-phase machines with sinusoidally distributed windings and driven by field-oriented control. By applying the signal to the x-y plane, which is available in this type of machines and does not produce air-gap flux, no torque ripple is generated. Experimental results validate the proposed technique.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2479410","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2479410","startPage":"5141","endPage":"5148","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7394209/07274367.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274367/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation Method of Stator Winding Temperature for Dual Three-Phase Machines Based on DC-Signal Injection","volume":"31","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"15754661","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7274367/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and by the European Commission"},{"fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)","grantNumber":"DPI2012-31283"},{"fundingName":"FPI scholarship","grantNumber":"BES-2013-063149"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation Method of Stator Winding Temperature for Dual Three-Phase Machines Based on DC-Signal Injection","sourcePdf":"tpel-dovalgandoy-2479410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082658S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7274367","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7274369,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Huan Tsai","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Mediatek Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7307914/7274369/7274369-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jen-Huan Tsai received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Electrical Engineering Department of National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 2009, 2010, and 2014, respectively.","Since 2014, he has been an Engineer with Mediatek, Hsinchu, Taiwan, where he has been engaged in research and development of wireless communication systems.

The proposed architecture obtains a good area and efficiency performance by cascading the Dickson charge pumps and the symmetrical Cockcroft-Walton charge pumps, and paralleling them with the proposed auxiliary charge pumps formed by parasitics. Implemented in a standard 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process, the prototype provides a wide output range of 3-6 V and 30-240 \u03bcA load from a 1 V supply with an efficiency of 48-58% (52% at the 6 V output when the gain is six). By using on-chip MOS capacitors as the flying capacitors, an area reduction of 66% as compared to the Dickson charge-pump of similar performance is achieved. The area shrinks to 0.05 mm 2 per 9\u00d7 interleaved cell. The entailed efficiency loss due to parasitics is compensated by the proposed auxiliary parasitic pumping paths feeding forward to redirect the parasitic charge flow. With this technique, the efficiency enhances extra 11%. The technique is applicable to other on-chip charge-pumps.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2465853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2465853","startPage":"2533","endPage":"2548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7307914/07274369.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1 V Input, 3 V-to-6 V Output, 58%-Efficient Integrated Charge Pump With a Hybrid Topology for Area Reduction and an Improved Efficiency by Using Parasitics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A 1 V Input, 3 V-to-6 V Output, 58%-Efficient Integrated Charge Pump With a Hybrid Topology for Area Reduction and an Improved Efficiency by Using Parasitics","volume":"50","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15557944","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274369/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1 V Input, 3 V-to-6 V Output, 58%-Efficient Integrated Charge Pump With a Hybrid Topology for Area Reduction and an Improved Efficiency by Using Parasitics","sourcePdf":"jssc-ko-2465853-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129131S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7307914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7307914","articleId":"7274369","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7274435,"authors":[{"name":"Bongshin Lee","affiliation":["University of Calgary"],"bio":{"p":["Bongshin Lee is a researcher in Microsoft Research's neXus Group.

A physics-based SPICE model calibrated with HfOx RRAM is employed for circuit and array-level simulations. The RRAM state-flipping is attributed to the transient photocurrents at neighboring transistors. Single-bit-upset (SBU) caused by either single-event upset (SEU) or multiple-event upset (MEU) is modeled and simulated in the one-transistor and one-resistor (1T1R) array, which corroborates with experimental observations. In addition, circuit simulation is performed to investigate the impact of transient-induced soft errors in a 1024 \u00d71024 crossbar array. The sensitive locations in crossbar arrays are the driver circuits at the edge of the array. The simulations show that the crossbar array with HfOx RRAM is of high radiation tolerance thanks to the V/2 bias scheme. However, multiple-bit upset (MBU) may occur if using other oxide materials with lower operation voltage. Voltage spikes generated at the edge of the array may propagate along rows or columns as there is no isolation between cells in the crossbar array.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2015.2465164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2015.2465164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7295655/07274484.pdf","startPage":"2294","endPage":"2301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7295655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Single-Bit and Multiple-Bit Upsets in Oxide RRAM-Based 1T1R and Crossbar Memory Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Single-Bit and Multiple-Bit Upsets in Oxide RRAM-Based 1T1R and Crossbar Memory Arrays","volume":"62","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2015","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520319","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274484/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Single-Bit and Multiple-Bit Upsets in Oxide RRAM-Based 1T1R and Crossbar Memory Arrays","sourcePdf":"tns-liu-2465164-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119034S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7295655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7295655","articleId":"7274484","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7274486,"authors":[{"name":"David N. ter Weele","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"David N.","lastName":"ter Weele","id":"37085678118"},{"name":"Dennis R.

By adopting the capacitive transduction principle, the sensor enables the direct sensing of normal and shear forces at surgical instrument tips. Thus, three-DOF pulling forces and a single-DOF grasping force can be measured for haptic feedback control of robotic minimally invasive surgery systems. The sensor consists of four capacitive transducers, and all the transducers including analog signal processing units are embedded in small surgical instrument tips. The four-DOF force sensing is enabled thanks to the four capacitive transducers by using the force transformation method. In this study, the instrument is designed and manufactured to be adaptable to the open-source surgical robot platform, called Raven-II. In addition, the sensing system is experimentally validated through its application to the Raven-II by using a reference force sensor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274530/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15474983","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Force Sensor Integrated Surgical Forceps for Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Convergence Technology Development Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004083","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"2014M3C1B2048175"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2011-0031143"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force Sensor Integrated Surgical Forceps for Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery","sourcePdf":"tro-choi-2473515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078762S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7274528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"7274528","articleId":"7274530","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":7274624,"authors":[{"name":"Karthick Thiyagarajan","affiliation":["Centre for Autonomous Systems (CAS), Sydney (UTS), Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Karthick","lastName":"Thiyagarajan","id":"37085642434"},{"name":"Sarath Kodagoda","affiliation":["Centre for Autonomous Systems (CAS), Sydney (UTS), Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Sarath","lastName":"Kodagoda","id":"37403026000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7338-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7337-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"}],"articleNumber":"7274624","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Conferences","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","Gaussian processes","infrared imaging","learning (artificial intelligence)","moisture measurement","sanitary engineering","sensor arrays","sensor fusion","temperature measurement","thermal conductivity","thermocouples","thermopiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart surface temperature monitoring","smart moisture content monitoring","multisensory data fusion","infrared thermopile array sensor","thermocouple probe","resistance moisture content estimation","Gaussian process based machine learning technique","resistive sensor","sewer environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth level temperature","Gaussian Process","Moisture content","Resistive measurement","Surface temperature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274624","abstract":"This paper characterizes the practice of Infrared Thermopile array sensor to monitor the surface temperature and also temperatures at different depth levels by employing the thermocouple probes.

However, with intermittent and random energy arrivals, it is challenging to provide satisfactory quality of service (QoS) in EH networks. To enjoy the greenness brought by EH while overcoming the instability of the renewable energy sources, hybrid energy supply (HES) networks that are powered by both EH and the electric grid have emerged as a new paradigm for green communications. In this paper, we will propose new design methodologies for HES green cellular networks with the help of Lyapunov optimization techniques. The network service cost, which addresses both the grid energy consumption and achievable QoS, is adopted as the performance metric, and it is optimized via base station assignment and power control (BAPC). Our main contribution is a low-complexity online algorithm to minimize the long-term average network service cost, namely, the Lyapunov optimization-based BAPC (LBAPC) algorithm. One main advantage of this algorithm is that the decisions depend only on the instantaneous side information without requiring distribution information of channels and EH processes. To determine the network operation, we only need to solve a deterministic per-time slot problem, for which an efficient inner-outer optimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to be asymptotically optimal via rigorous analysis. Finally, sample simulation results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis as well as validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07274642.pdf","startPage":"2463","endPage":"2477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lyapunov Optimization Approach for Green Cellular Networks With Hybrid Energy Supplies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Lyapunov Optimization Approach for Green Cellular Networks With Hybrid Energy Supplies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274642/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15602328","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274642/","volume":"33","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grant Council","grantNumber":"610212"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lyapunov Optimization Approach for Green Cellular Networks With Hybrid Energy Supplies","sourcePdf":"jsac-mao-2481209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168586S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274642","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7274644,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Yang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274644/gyang-2481258-small.gif","p":["Gang Yang (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees (first class Hons.) in communication engineering, communication and information systems, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2015.

The acquisition of the forward-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER) state information (F-CSI) at the ET (or RFID reader) is challenging, since the ERs (or RFID tags) are typically too energy-and-hardware-constrained to estimate or feedback the F-CSI. The ET leverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly. We first analyze the harvested energy obtained using the estimated BS-CSI. Furthermore, we optimize the resource allocation to maximize the total utility of harvested energy. For WET to single ER, we obtain the optimal channel-training energy in a semiclosed form. For WET to multiple ERs, we optimize the channel-training energy and the energy allocation weights for different energy beams. For the straightforward weighted-sum-energy (WSE) maximization, the optimal WET scheme is shown to use only one energy beam, which leads to unfairness among ERs and motivates us to consider the complicated proportional-fair-energy (PFE) maximization. For PFE maximization, we show that it is a biconvex problem, and propose a block-coordinate-descent-based algorithm to find the close-to-optimal solution. Numerical results show that with the optimized solutions, the harvested energy suffers slight reduction of less than 10%, compared to that obtained using the perfect F-CSI.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07274644.pdf","startPage":"2974","endPage":"2987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-antenna Wireless Energy Transfer for Backscatter Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-antenna Wireless Energy Transfer for Backscatter Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274644/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15602348","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274644/","volume":"33","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-antenna Wireless Energy Transfer for Backscatter Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jsac-yang-2481258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09982S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274644","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7274645,"authors":[{"name":"Kalle L\u00e4hetkangas","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274645/lahet-2481217-small.gif","p":["Kalle L\u00e4hetkangas (S\u201911) received the B.Sc.

We show how the intermediate nodes find the route distributively. This protocol takes into account the quality of the MIMO channels and allocates power to them so that the end-to-end transmission energy is minimized. The resulting protocol is easy to implement and provides the most energy efficient route and the power allocation for the data transmission. We perform simulations on Rayleigh-fading channels to show the significant energy benefits of the proposed route discovery protocol against a dynamic source routing (DSR)-based routing protocol with optimal power allocation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Route Discovery Protocol for Energy Efficient Networks With MIMO Links","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481217","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07274645.pdf","startPage":"2735","endPage":"2748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Route Discovery Protocol for Energy Efficient Networks With MIMO Links","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7274645/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602339","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Route Discovery Protocol for Energy Efficient Networks With MIMO Links","sourcePdf":"jsac-lahetkangas-2481217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114117S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274645","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274646,"authors":[{"name":"MinChul Ju","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274646/minju-2481213-small.gif","p":["MinChul Ju (M\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, South Korea, in 1997, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2010.

Considering the fact that each node in the network aims to maximize its own metric, we adopt a game theoretic approach that foresees offering relaying of the sources' data in exchange for energy provided to the relays, and simultaneously offering energy to the relays in exchange for their relaying services. We first study a Stackelberg competition with the single relay node as the leader, and investigate the impact of having multiple source nodes in the system. We next study the reciprocal Stackelberg game with the single source as the leader, and investigate the inter-relay competition with multiple relays. We find that in the Stackelberg games, the leader can improve its individual utility by influencing the follower's decision accordingly, even more so when there are multiple followers. We next formulate a noncooperative game between the source and the relay and show the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium by an appropriate pricing mechanism. The equilibrium maximizes the total utility of the network and allows the destination to choose how much data to receive from each node.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","volume":"33","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"15602351","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274650/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Incentivizing Signal and Energy Cooperation in Wireless Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006445","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS 09-64364 and CCF 14-22347"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentivizing Signal and Energy Cooperation in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-varan-2481279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096304S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7274650","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7274652,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Lin Ku","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jung-li, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7274652/menku-2481215-small.gif","p":["Meng-Lin Ku (M\u201911) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2002, 2003, and 2009, respectively, all in communication engineering.

In this paper, we consider a cooperative system in which one source node transmits data to one destination with the assistance of an energy harvesting decode-and-forward (DF) relay node. Our objective is to minimize the long-term average symbol error rate (SER) performance through a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. By doing so, we find the optimal stochastic power control at the relay that adapts the transmission power to the changes of energy harvesting, battery, channel, and decoding states. We derive a finite-integral expression for the exact average SER of the cooperative system. Further insights are gained by analyzing the asymptotic average SER and its lower and upper bounds at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the performance is eventually characterized by the occurrence probability of the relay's actions at the worst channel states in the MDP. We also show that the optimal cooperative policy at asymptotically high SNR follows a threshold-type structure, i.e., the relay spends the harvested energy only when the signal is successfully decoded and the source is faced with the worst channel condition in its direct link. Using these observations to quantify the diversity gain and the energy harvesting gain, we reveal that full diversity is guaranteed if and only if the probability of harvesting zero energy quantum is zero, which can be achieved by reducing the energy quantum size or increasing the energy harvesting capability. Finally, we present several numerical examples to validate the analytical findings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Relays","Batteries","Decoding","Cooperative

Several spectrum-based techniques for the prediction of protein coding regions have been proposed. However, the outstanding issue in most of the proposed techniques is that these techniques depend on an experimentally-selected, predefined value of the window length. In this paper, we propose a new Wide-Range Wavelet Window (WRWW) method for the prediction of protein coding regions. The analysis of the proposed wavelet window shows that its frequency response can adapt its width to accommodate the change in the window length so that it can allow or prevent frequencies other than the basic frequency in the analysis of DNA sequences. This feature makes the proposed window capable of analyzing DNA sequences with a wide range of the window lengths without degradation in the performance. The experimental analysis of applying the WRWW method and other spectrum-based methods to five benchmark datasets has shown that the proposed method outperforms other methods along a wide range of the window lengths. In addition, the experimental analysis has shown that the proposed method is dominant in the prediction of both short and long exons.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2015.2476789","startPage":"742","endPage":"753","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2015.2476789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7534962","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/7534962/07274659.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Protein Coding Regions Using a Wide-Range Wavelet Window Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274659/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Protein Coding Regions Using a Wide-Range Wavelet Window Method","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7274659/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16208894","pubMedId":"26415183","publicationDate":"1 July-Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Protein Coding Regions Using a Wide-Range Wavelet Window Method","sourcePdf":"tcbb-marhon-2476789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072578S","chronDate":"July-Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"7534962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7534962","articleId":"7274659","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":7274660,"authors":[{"name":"Alp Ert\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Kocaeli University Laboratory of Image and Signal Processing (KULIS), Kocaeli University, \u0130zmit, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7404297/7274660/ertur-2477431-small.gif","p":["Alp Ert\u00fcrk (S\u201911\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and telecommunications engineering from Kocaeli University, \u0130zmit, Turkey, in 2013.","He was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Hyperspectral Computing Laboratory (HyperComp), University of Extremadura, C\u00e1ceres, Spain.

Sparse unmixing sidesteps two important drawbacks of the regular spectral unmixing process, namely the difficulty of estimating the number of endmembers, and the process of extracting the endmembers itself, the result of which will vary according to the utilized extraction method. In this work, sparse unmixing is exploited for the first time in the context of multitemporal hyperspectral data analysis and change detection. Change detection by sparse unmixing based on spectral libraries has the important advantage of providing not only pixel-level but also subpixel-level change information for the hyperspectral data. The changes that occur in multitemporal datasets due to time or as a result of a significant event are revealed, at subpixel-level, as the abundances of underlying endmembers within a pixel, or as variations in the distribution of these endmembers throughout the scene. The proposed approach is validated by experimental studies on both carefully prepared synthetic datasets and real datasets, using different spectral libraries.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2477431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7404297/07274660.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2477431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Unmixing-Based Change Detection for Multitemporal Hyperspectral Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274660/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Unmixing-Based Change Detection for Multitemporal Hyperspectral Images","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15775368","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274660/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Unmixing-Based Change Detection for Multitemporal Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"jstars-erturk-2477431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061526S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7404297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7404297","articleId":"7274660","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7274667,"authors":[{"name":"Yejun He","affiliation":["Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Antennas and Propagation, College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7337475/7274667/yejhe-2481488-small.gif","p":["Yejun He (SM\u201909) received the B.S. degree in mechatronics engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, the M.S. degree in communication and information system from Wuhan University of Technology (WHUT), Wuhan, China, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 1994, 2002, and 2005, respectively.","From September 2005 to March 2006, he was a Research Associate with the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong.

Elements are arranged such that high-frequency elements are embedded in low frequency elements to reduce volume. A baffle is used to reflect the transmitted power density in the forward direction and also improve isolation between elements. Therefore, surrounding isolation baffles and rectangular baffles are appended around high-frequency elements and low-frequency elements, respectively. The diameter of the proposed antenna cover is only 200 mm, which is smaller than the existing antenna diameter of 280 mm. Compared with the other commonly used antennas, the proposed antenna also has some advantages such as concealment and low profile using a tubular form of radome, which can easily integrate the proposed antenna with the surrounding environment. The measured results verify that the proposed antenna meets the stringent design requirements: voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) is less than 1.3, the isolation is greater than 30 dB, and the pattern parameters also meet telecommunications industry standards.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2481488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7337475/07274667.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2481488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337475","startPage":"5399","endPage":"5408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Dual-Band, Dual-Polarized, Miniaturized and Low-Profile Base Station Antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Dual-Band, Dual-Polarized, Miniaturized and Low-Profile Base Station Antenna","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15618637","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274667/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372077"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Program of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"JC201005250067A and JCJY20120817163755061"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"2013B090200011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Dual-Band, Dual-Polarized, Miniaturized and Low-Profile Base Station Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-he-2481488-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06368S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7337475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"7337475","articleId":"7274667","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7274684,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu Yin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiu Yin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291969000"},{"name":"Wen Duan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Duan","id":"37085578488"},{"name":"Yong-Mei Pan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Mei","lastName":"Pan","id":"38560055600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7274684","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":174,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6796},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Filtering","Antenna measurements","Pins","Patch antennas","Reflection coefficient"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-gain filtering patch antenna","high-selectivity filtering responses","high-gain radiation performance","driven patch","stacked patch","U-slot","out-of-band suppression levels","LTE band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filtering antenna","high gain","quasi-elliptic response","stacked patch","shorting pins","radiation null"]},{"kwd":["Filtering antenna","high gain","quasi-elliptic response","radiation null","shorting pins","stacked patch"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel kind of patch antenna with high-selectivity filtering responses and high-gain radiation performance.

In addition, we present a new eight-ary field exponentiation architecture which does not require precomputed or stored intermediate values.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2481408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7506354/07274686.pdf","startPage":"2495","endPage":"2509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7506354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2481408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Architectures for Digit-Level Single, Hybrid-Double, Hybrid-Triple Field Multiplications and Exponentiation Using Gaussian Normal Bases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"New Architectures for Digit-Level Single, Hybrid-Double, Hybrid-Triple Field Multiplications and Exponentiation Using Gaussian Normal Bases","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274686/","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274686/","volume":"65","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005450","fundingName":"Discovery and Discovery Accelerate Supplement"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Architectures for Digit-Level Single, Hybrid-Double, Hybrid-Triple Field Multiplications and Exponentiation Using Gaussian Normal Bases","sourcePdf":"tc-elrazouk-2481408-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132247S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7506354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7506354","articleId":"7274686","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7274694,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Diaz-Montes","affiliation":["Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute, Rutgers University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8307205/7274694/monte-2481410-small.gif","p":["Javier Diaz-Montes received the PhD degree in computer science from\n the Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Spain (\u201cDoctor Europeus\u201d, 2010).

Elastic and on-demand access to resources (and other services), the abstraction of \u201cunlimited\u201d resources, and attractive pricing models provide incentives for scientists to move their workflows into clouds. Generalizing these concepts beyond a single virtualized datacenter, it is possible to create federated marketplaces where different types of resources (e.g., clouds, HPC grids, supercomputers) that may be geographically distributed, are collectively exposed as a single elastic infrastructure. This presents opportunities for optimizing the execution of application workflows with heterogeneous and dynamic requirements, and tackling larger scale problems. In this paper, we introduce a framework to manage the end-to-end execution of data-intensive application workflows in dynamic software-defined resource federation. This framework enables the autonomic execution of workflows by elastically provisioning an appropriate set of resources that meet application requirements, and by adapting this set of resources at runtime as the requirements change. It also allows users to customize scheduling policies that drive the way resources federated and used. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we study the execution of two different data-intensive scientific workflows in a multi-cloud federation using different policies and objective functions.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2481410","startPage":"250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8307205/07274694.pdf","endPage":"263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2481410","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6245519/8307205/7274694-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274694/","displayDocTitle":"Supporting Data-Intensive Workflows in Software-Defined Federated Multi-Clouds","volume":"6","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7274694/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17633490","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"OCI 1339036, OCI 1310283 and OCI 1441376"},{"fundingName":"IBM via OCR"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"OCI-0910812"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Supporting Data-Intensive Workflows in Software-Defined Federated Multi-Clouds","sourcePdf":"tcc-diazmontes-2481410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110533S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8307205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8307205","articleId":"7274694","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7274695,"authors":[{"name":"Xinwu Liang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7567607/7274695/liang-2477606-small.gif","p":["Xinwu Liang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, from 2011 to 2014.

Such unexpected events often lead to thermal anomalies - hotspots, fugues, and coldspots - which impact the cost of operation of datacenters. A model-based thermal anomaly detection mechanism, which compares expected (obtained using heat-generation and -extraction models) and observedthermal maps (obtained using thermal cameras) of datacenters, is proposed. In addition, a novel Thermal Anomaly-aware Resource Allocation (TARA) is designed to induce a time-varying thermal fingerprint (thermal map) of the datacenter so to maximize the detection accuracy of the anomalies. As shown via experiments on a small-scale testbed as well as via trace-driven simulations, such model-based thermal anomaly detection solution in conjunction with TARA significantly improves the detection probability compared to anomaly detection when scheduling algorithms such as random, round robin, and best-fit-decreasing are employed.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2481423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8372844/07274707.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2481423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8372844","startPage":"330","endPage":"343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Thermal Anomaly Detection in Cloud Datacenters Using Thermal Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274707","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6245519/8372844/7274707-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Thermal Anomaly Detection in Cloud Datacenters Using Thermal Imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2018","accessionNumber":"17824183","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7274707/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-0855091, IIP-0758566 and CNS-1117263"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Model-Based Thermal Anomaly Detection in Cloud Datacenters Using Thermal Imaging","sourcePdf":"tcc-lee-2481423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114304S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8372844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8372844","articleId":"7274707","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274714,"authors":[{"name":"Ci Chen","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7567607/7274714/cchen-2475363-small.gif","p":["Ci Chen received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation from the Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering with the School of Automation.","His current research interests include robotic systems and intelligent control."]},"firstName":"Ci","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085533061"},{"name":"Zhi Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7567607/7274714/liu-2475363-small.gif","p":["Zhi Liu received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1997, the M.S. degree from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

To eliminate the effect of the control shock from the traditional Nussbaum function, a new type of the saturated Nussbaum function is developed with the idea of time-elongation.

In what follows, the proposed theorem is integrated with the adaptive control technique such that the stability analysis of the robotic system is completed. It thus guarantees that the state of the robotic system asymptotically converges to the desired trajectory. Finally, comparative studies are carried out to validate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2475363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7567607/07274714.pdf","startPage":"2311","endPage":"2322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2475363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7567607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturated Nussbaum Function Based Approach for Robotic Systems With Unknown Actuator Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Saturated Nussbaum Function Based Approach for Robotic Systems With Unknown Actuator Dynamics","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7274714/","accessionNumber":"16302740","pubMedId":"26415196","volume":"46","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province through the Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"S20120011437"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of New Century Excellent Talent","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0637"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20124420130001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573108, 61273192 and 61333013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturated Nussbaum Function Based Approach for Robotic Systems With Unknown Actuator Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tcyb-liu-2475363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120611S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7567607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7567607","articleId":"7274714","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7274716,"authors":[{"name":"Maurice Khabbaz","affiliation":["ECCE Department, Notre-Dame University, Shouf, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8307205/7274716/khabb-2481429-small.gif","p":["Maurice Khabbaz is currently an assistant professor of electrical,\n computer, and communications engineering at Notre-Dame University, Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon.

This is especially true since essential quality-of-service (QoS) performance metrics such as the UR blocking probability as well as the data center's response time are tightly coupled to such a process. This paper revolves around the proposal of a novel Deadline-Aware UR Scheduling Scheme (DASS) that has the objective of improving the data center's QoS performance in term of the above-mentioned metrics. A minority of existing work in the literature targets the formulation of mathematical models for the purpose of characterizing a cloud data center's performance. As a contribution to covering this gap, this paper presents an analytical model, which is developed for the purpose of capturing the system's dynamics and evaluating its performance when operating under DASS. The model's results' accuracy are verified through simulations. Also, the performance of the data center achieved under DASS is compared to its counterpart achieved under the more generic First-In-First-Out (FIFO) scheme. The reported results indicate that DASS outperforms FIFO by 11 to 58 percent in terms of the blocking probability and by 82 to 89 percent in terms of the system's response time.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2481429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8307205/07274716.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2481429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307205","startPage":"141","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling and Analysis of A Novel Deadline-Aware Scheduling Scheme for Cloud Computing Data Centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modelling and Analysis of A Novel Deadline-Aware Scheduling Scheme for Cloud Computing Data Centers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274716/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633494","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7274716/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSERC Discovery"},{"fundingName":"Concordia University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and Analysis of A Novel Deadline-Aware Scheduling Scheme for Cloud Computing Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tcc-khabbaz-2481429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164817S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8307205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8307205","articleId":"7274716","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274717,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangming Dai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/7484807/7274717/dai-2481401-small.gif","p":["Xiangming Dai received the BE degree in software engineering from\n Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2011.

We examine the performance of these two algorithms in both small and large clusters using real data traces and synthetic workloads, and compare them to other alternatives.

However, the noise level of the different regions in an interferogram changes greatly due to the terrain topography. The InSAR phase will be overfiltered in high-coherence regions and be underfiltered with high noise level in low-coherence regions if the unchangeable processing parameters are used. In this paper, we propose an improved InSAR phase filter in frequency domain. First, we use different window sizes to suppress the phase noise, and the window size is determined by the coherence of the central processing pixel. A pixel with higher coherence uses a smaller filtering window size and vice versa. Second, the samples in the filtering window are not independent and identically distributed samples for the terrain topography. To deal with this problem, we use fringe frequency compensation to eliminate the effect of the terrain topography. Third, combining with a newly defined filtering parameter \u03b1, we execute the phase filtering procedure pixel by pixel, which is different from the Goldstein filters. Furthermore, we use the Fourier transformation of a small window (generally 3 \u00d7 3) to deal with the power spectrum of the InSAR phase patches. Compared with other improved Goldstein filters and spatial-based filters, the effectiveness of the newly improved InSAR phase noise reduction method in frequency domain is investigated by both simulated and real data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274723/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15720446","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7274723/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved InSAR Phase Noise Filter in Frequency Domain","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471276"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved InSAR Phase Noise Filter in Frequency Domain","sourcePdf":"tgrs-suo-2476355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120456S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7386543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7386543","articleId":"7274723","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7274725,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China","Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Dependable Systems and Networks, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8307205/7274725/zhang-2481389-small.gif","p":["Wei Zhang received the BS degree in computer science from Hunan\n University, China, in 2011.

As a fundamental data utilization, secure keyword search over encrypted cloud data has attracted the interest of many researchers recently. However, most of existing researches are based on an ideal assumption that the cloud server is \u201ccurious but honest\u201d, where the search results are not verified. In this paper, we consider a more challenging model, where the cloud server would probably behave dishonestly. Based on this model, we explore the problem of result verification for the secure ranked keyword search. Different from previous data verification schemes, we propose a novel deterrent-based scheme. With our carefully devised verification data, the cloud server cannot know which data owners, or how many data owners exchange anchor data which will be used for verifying the cloud server's misbehavior. With our systematically designed verification construction, the cloud server cannot know which data owners' data are embedded in the verification data buffer, or how many data owners' verification data are actually used for verification. All the cloud server knows is that, once he behaves dishonestly, he would be discovered with a high probability, and punished seriously once discovered. Furthermore, we propose to optimize the value of parameters used in the construction of the secret verification data buffer. Finally, with thorough analysis and extensive experiments, we confirm the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2481389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2481389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8307205/07274725.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Catch You if You Misbehave: Ranked Keyword Search Results Verification in Cloud Computing","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17633495","htmlLink":"/document/7274725/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61173038 and 61472125"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Catch You if You Misbehave: Ranked Keyword Search Results Verification in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tcc-zhang-2481389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.24961S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8307205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8307205","articleId":"7274725","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274732,"authors":[{"name":"Christian J.

The effectiveness of regularization is often highly dependent on the selection of regularization parameters that are typically determined by cross-validation (CV). However, the CV imposes two main limitations on BCIs: 1) a large amount of training data is required from the user and 2) it takes a relatively long time to calibrate the classifier. These limitations substantially deteriorate the system's practicability and may cause a user to be reluctant to use BCIs. In this paper, we introduce a sparse Bayesian method by exploiting Laplace priors, namely, SBLaplace, for EEG classification. A sparse discriminant vector is learned with a Laplace prior in a hierarchical fashion under a Bayesian evidence framework. All required model parameters are automatically estimated from training data without the need of CV. Extensive comparisons are carried out between the SBLaplace algorithm and several other competing methods based on two EEG data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the SBLaplace algorithm achieves better overall performance than the competing algorithms for EEG classification.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2476656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7605560/07274734.pdf","startPage":"2256","endPage":"2267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2476656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7605560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Bayesian Classification of EEG for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274734/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Bayesian Classification of EEG for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","volume":"27","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397049","pubMedId":"26415189","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274734/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research through the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"15K15955 and 26730125"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201124, 61202155, 61203127, 61305028, 61573142 and 91420302"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"WG1414005, WH1314023 and WH1414022"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030308009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Bayesian Classification of EEG for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zhang-2476656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164252S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7605560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"7605560","articleId":"7274734","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274740,"authors":[{"name":"Fuyong Xing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Fuyong","lastName":"Xing","id":"37071717200"},{"name":"Yuanpu Xie","affiliation":["J.

Automated nucleus segmentation is a prerequisite for various quantitative analyses including automatic morphological feature computation. However, it remains to be a challenging problem due to the complex nature of histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for robust and automatic nucleus segmentation with shape preservation. Given a nucleus image, it begins with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate a probability map, on which an iterative region merging approach is performed for shape initializations. Next, a novel segmentation algorithm is exploited to separate individual nuclei combining a robust selection-based sparse shape model and a local repulsive deformable model. One of the significant benefits of the proposed framework is that it is applicable to different staining histopathology images. Due to the feature learning characteristic of the deep CNN and the high level shape prior modeling, the proposed method is general enough to perform well across multiple scenarios. We have tested the proposed algorithm on three large-scale pathology image datasets using a range of different tissue and stain preparations, and the comparative experiments with recent state of the arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2481436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7396977/07274740.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2481436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automatic Learning-Based Framework for Robust Nucleus Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"An Automatic Learning-Based Framework for Robust Nucleus Segmentation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274740/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15755148","pubMedId":"26415167","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274740/","volume":"35","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automatic Learning-Based Framework for Robust Nucleus Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tmi-xing-2481436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158375S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7396977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"7396977","articleId":"7274740","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7274741,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Broggi","affiliation":["VisLab, Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Parma, Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7330243/7274741/brogg-2477556-small.gif","p":["\n\nAlberto Broggi received the Dr.Ing.

The instantaneous active and reactive power theory for single-phase converters is discussed, on the basis of a second-order generalized integrator. The modulation function is resolved from the cost function of the MP-DPC scheme. The relationship between the instantaneous powers and ac-side inductance mismatch is discussed. The inductance mismatch has an effect on the reactive power, but not effect on active power. The quantitative expression of reactive power caused by inductance mismatch is shown and verified in the experimental test. An inductance parameter online estimation scheme is proposed to eliminate its effect on reactive power. Compared with the conventional proportional-integral-based instantaneous current control scheme and finite-control-set MP-DPC scheme, the proposed MP-DPC can provide these advantageous features: lower current harmonics and total harmonic distortion components, faster dynamic response, fewer adjusted parameters, and zero steady-state error. In addition, the proposed MP-DPC is free of the weighting factor selection in cost function. The effectiveness of the proposed MP-DPC scheme is verified by experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Model Predictive Power Control Strategy for Single-Phase PWM Converters With Modulation Function Optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2481323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7394209/07274743.pdf","startPage":"5279","endPage":"5289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2481323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Model Predictive Power Control Strategy for Single-Phase PWM Converters With Modulation Function Optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7274743/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15754651","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51207131, 51277153 and 51577160"},{"fundingName":"National High Speed Railway Joint Key Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1134205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Model Predictive Power Control Strategy for Single-Phase PWM Converters With Modulation Function Optimization","sourcePdf":"tpel-song-2481323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100792S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7274743","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274744,"authors":[{"name":"Ishan G.

A novel method of routing the internal memory bus to individual subarrays using TSVs and fanout buffers enables 3D-ProWiz to use smaller dimension subarrays without significant area overhead. The use of TSVs at subarray-level granularity eliminates the need to use slow and power hungry global lines, which in turn reduces the random access latency and activation-precharge energy. 3D-ProWiz yields the best latency and energy consumption values per access among other well-known 3D DRAM architectures. Experimental results with PARSEC benchmarks indicate that 3D-ProWiz achieves 41.9 percent reduction in average latency, 52 percent reduction in average power, and 80.6 percent reduction in energy-delay product (EDP) on average over DRAM architectures from prior work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","volume":"1","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15663141","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274744/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"3D-ProWiz: An Energy-Efficient and Optically-Interfaced 3D DRAM Architecture with Reduced Data Access Overhead","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"SRC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CCF-1252500 and CCF-1302693"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"AFOSR","grantNumber":"FA9550-13-1-0110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D-ProWiz: An Energy-Efficient and Optically-Interfaced 3D DRAM Architecture with Reduced Data Access Overhead","sourcePdf":"tmscs-thakkar-2481425-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102525S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7358202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7358202","articleId":"7274744","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7274746,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085733013"},{"name":"W.

A finite-element method (FEM) combined with a dynamic dual-response-surface model (dual-RSM) is proposed to compute an objective function. The FEM is employed as a basic tool for the computation of the objective function. In order to build up the dual-RSM model, a radial basis function and a moving least-square approximation are both employed. The results that are obtained from the dual-RSM model are dynamically compared together with a preset goodness-of-fit, which determines whether the accuracies of the dual-RSM are high enough to replace the FEM computation. This strategy makes the FEM computation not always necessary at all the sample points in the optimization process and ensures the accuracy of the solution. For the purpose of showing the effectiveness of the proposed optimization methodology, the optimal design process of a dual PM-excited synchronous motor is taken as an example in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7410156/07274746.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2481608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2481608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Dual-Response-Surface Methodology for Optimal Design of a Permanent-Magnet Motor Using Finite-Element Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element analysis","Computational modeling","Optimization","Linear programming","Fitting","Synchronous motors","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","least squares approximations","optimisation","permanent magnet motors","response surface methodology","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motor","dynamic dual response surface methodology","optimal design","finite element method","FEM","objective function computation","radial basis function","moving least square approximation","optimization process","dual PM-excited synchronous motor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric motor","finite-element method","goodness-of-fitting","moving least square approximation","optimization method","particle swarm optimization","radial basis function","response surface model"]},{"kwd":["Electric motor","finite-element method (FEM)","goodness-of-fitting (GoF)","moving least-square (MLS) approximation","optimization method","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","radial basis function (RBF)","response surface model (RSM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Dual-Response-Surface Methodology for Optimal Design of a Permanent-Magnet Motor Using Finite-Element Method","volume":"52","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7274746/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786529","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","externalId":"7204304","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong SAR Government","grantNumber":"PolyU 5153/13E and 152050/14E"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Dual-Response-Surface Methodology for Optimal Design of a Permanent-Magnet Motor Using Finite-Element Method","sourcePdf":"tmag-fu-2481608-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049271S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7410156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7410156","articleId":"7274746","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274761,"authors":[{"name":"Celimuge Wu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Systems, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7355269/7274761/wu-2481464-small.gif","p":["\n\nCelimuge Wu (M'10) received the M.E. degree from Beijing Institute of \nTechnology, Beijing, China, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan, \nin 2010.","Since 2010, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Graduate School of Information Systems, University of \nElectro-Communications.

Existing routing protocols do not seriously address all these issues and are not evaluated for a real VANET environment. Therefore, it is difficult for these protocols to attain a high performance and to work properly under various scenarios. In this paper, we first discuss the challenges of routing in VANETs based on the data acquired from real-world experiments and then propose a routing protocol that is able to learn the best transmission parameters by interacting with the environment. The protocol takes into account multiple metrics, specifically data transmission rate, vehicle movement, and route length.

For the train, a two-hop architecture, under which, passengers communicate with base stations (BSs) via a mobile relay (MR) is employed. Then all passengers in the train can be treated as one large user represented by the MR. Since the channel conditions of the MR and local users are different in both large scale-fading and small-scale fading, we allocate the system resources over two time-scales for them. We formulate the resource allocation problem in the downlink OFDMA system as a capacity optimization problem for the MR subject to the sum capacity constraint of local users. We discuss the problem in two cases where perfect intercarrier interference (ICI) cancellation and no ICI cancellation are applied at the MR. The corresponding capacities and optimal power and subcarrier allocation (OPSA) policies are presented for each case. The capacities obtained in these two cases bound the achievable transmission rate of the MR and provide meaningful guidance for the application of ICI cancellation. Finally, the implementation issues of resource allocation policies are discussed to simplify application in practical scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07274765.pdf","startPage":"1018","endPage":"1030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2481431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2481431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing Services for the High-Speed Train and Local Users in the Same OFDMA System: Resource Allocation in the Downlink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Fading","Wireless communication","Doppler effect","Rail transportation","Downlink","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency division multiple access","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","optimisation","railway communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed train","broadband wireless services","base stations","two-hop architecture","mobile relay","small-scale fading","resource allocation problem","downlink OFDMA system","capacity optimization problem","perfect intercarrier interference cancellation","ICI cancellation","optimal power and subcarrier allocation policy","OPSA policy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDMA","mobile relay","inter-carrier interference","Doppler spread"]},{"kwd":["Resource allocation","OFDMA","mobile relay","intercarrier interference","Doppler spread"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Providing Services for the High-Speed Train and Local Users in the Same OFDMA System: Resource Allocation in the Downlink","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7274765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15785888","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China Major State Basic Research Development Program","grantNumber":"2012CB316100(2)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61171064 and 61321061"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing Services for the High-Speed Train and Local Users in the Same OFDMA System: Resource Allocation in the Downlink","sourcePdf":"twc-fan-2481431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115686S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7274765","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274769,"authors":[{"name":"Lizhen Cui","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/8425801/7274769/cui-2481421-small.gif","p":["Lizhen Cui received the bachelor's, MSc, and PhD degrees from\n Shandong University in 1999, 2002, 2005, respectively.

However, when tasks process big data stored in distributed data centers, the inevitable data movements will cause huge bandwidth cost and execution delay. In this paper, we construct a tripartite graph based model to formulate the data replica placement problem and propose a genetic algorithm based data replica placement strategy for scientific applications to reduce data transmissions in cloud. Our approach can reduce 1) the size of moved data, 2) the time of data movement and 3) the number of movements. We conduct experiments to compare the proposed strategy with the random placement strategy used in Hadoop Distributed Files System (HDFS), which demonstrates that our strategy has better performance for scientific applications in clouds.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2015.2481421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/8425801/07274769.pdf","startPage":"727","endPage":"739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2015.2481421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Based Data Replica Placement Strategy for Scientific Applications in Clouds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274769/","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Based Data Replica Placement Strategy for Scientific Applications in Clouds","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"1 July-Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17974377","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274769/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572295, 61573212, 61272241, 61303005 and 61303085"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Methods Work Special","grantNumber":"2015IM010200"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China","grantNumber":"ZR2014FM031 and ZR2013FQ014"},{"fundingName":"Shandong Province Major Independent Innovation Special Project","grantNumber":"2015ZDXX0201B03"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University","grantNumber":"2015JC031"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm Based Data Replica Placement Strategy for Scientific Applications in Clouds","sourcePdf":"tsc-cuilizhen-2481421-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10213S","chronDate":"July-Aug. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"8425801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8425801","articleId":"7274769","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7274772,"authors":[{"name":"Weile Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Weile","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085367202"},{"name":"Qinye Yin","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qinye","lastName":"Yin","id":"37270668400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7274772","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Cost function","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind carrier frequency offset estimation","MIMO-OFDM system","Cramer-Rao bound","SNR","performance error floor","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","multiple-input-multiple-output systems","CFO estimator","rank reduction criterion","constant modulus constellations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","constant modulus constellations","multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new blind carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator for multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems with constant modulus constellation.

It can transfer energy from the source to the relay. This will encourage more idle nodes to be involved in relaying. In this paper, the outage probability and the throughput of an amplify-and-forward relaying system using energy harvesting are analyzed. Both time switching and power-splitting harvesting schemes are considered. The analysis takes into account both the Nakagami-m fading caused by signal propagation and the interference caused by other transmitters. Numerical results show that time switching is more sensitive to system parameters than power splitting. Also, the system performance is more sensitive to the transmission rate requirement, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio in the first hop and the relaying method.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2481393","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07274775.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2481393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"1008","endPage":"1017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Harvesting AF Relaying in the Presence of Interference and Nakagami-- Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Harvesting AF Relaying in the Presence of Interference and Nakagami-<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula> Fading","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274775/","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7274775/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15785906","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Harvesting AF Relaying in the Presence of Interference and Nakagami-<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula> Fading","sourcePdf":"twc-chen-2481393-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103129S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7274775","onlineDate":"23 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7274776,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri \u00c1lvarez","affiliation":["Area of Signal Theory and Communications, Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Oviedo, Gij\u00f3n, Spain"],"firstName":"Yuri","lastName":"\u00c1lvarez","id":"37400677700"},{"name":"Yolanda Rodriguez-Vaqueiro","affiliation":["Atlantic Research Center, Universidad de Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Yolanda","lastName":"Rodriguez-Vaqueiro","id":"38328605100"},{"name":"Borja Gonzalez-Valdes","affiliation":["Atlantic Research Center, Universidad de Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Borja","lastName":"Gonzalez-Valdes","id":"38274282300"},{"name":"Carey M.

The idea is to study the reduction in the minimum number of receivers with respect to standard synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging to accurately recover the geometry of the object-under-test. 3-D CS main drawback is the increased calculation time with respect to standard SAR algorithms. To overcome this limitation, a novel technique consisting in splitting a large problem as a combination of small ones is proposed. These small problems can be solved via parallelized 3-D CS, resulting in calculation time savings. Moreover, practical implementation of a 3-D CS-based millimeter-wave imaging system is discussed. Validation with simulations and measurements is presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and

Comparing physical and virtual samples side-by-side simplifies the task by introducing a reference. The goal of this article is to study the influence of image exposure on the perception of realism on images of paint materials containing sparkling metallic flakes. We use a radiometrically calibrated DSLR camera to acquire high resolution raw photographs of our physical samples which provide us with radiometric information from the samples. This is combined with the data obtained from the calibration of a stereoscopic display and shutter glasses to transform the raw photographs into images that can be shown by the display, controlling the colorimetric output signal. This ensures that we can transform our data back and forth between a radiometric and a colorimetric representation, minimizing the loss of information throughout the chain of acquisition and visualization. In this article we propose a paired comparison scenario that improves the results from our previous work, focusing on three main aspects: stereoscopy, exposure time, and dynamic range. Our results show that observers consider stereoscopy as the most important factor of the three for judging the similarity of these images to the reference, followed by exposure time and dynamic range, which supports our claims from previous research.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCS.2015.7274878","publicationTitle":"2015 Colour and Visual Computing Symposium (CVCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Colour and Visual Computing Symposium (CVCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7270874/7274875/07274878.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/CVCS.2015.7274878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physically based image synthesis of materials : a methodology towards the visual comparison of physical vs. virtual samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Physically based image synthesis of materials : a methodology towards the visual comparison of physical vs. virtual samples","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-26 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7274878/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15487566","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274878/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physically based image synthesis of materials : a methodology towards the visual comparison of physical vs. virtual samples","confLoc":"Gjovik, Norway","sourcePdf":"01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049027S","chronDate":"25-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7270874","isNumber":"7274875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7270874","xplore-issue":"7274875","articleId":"7274878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7274885,"authors":[{"name":"Kajsa M\u00f8llersen","affiliation":["Norwegian Centre for Integrated Care and Telemedicine University Hospital of North Norway, Troms\u00f8, Norway"],"firstName":"Kajsa","lastName":"M\u00f8llersen","id":"37847046700"},{"name":"Jon Yngve Hardeberg","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Media Technology Gj\u00f8vik University College, Gj\u00f8vik, Norway"],"firstName":"Jon Yngve","lastName":"Hardeberg","id":"37589537500"},{"name":"Fred Godtliebsen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Troms\u00f8, Norway"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Godtliebsen","id":"37346722600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1765-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1764-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7274885","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"abstract":"Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer which is difficult to detect in its early stages.

Here, we introduce divergence-based colour features, using the Kullback-Leibler information as a preferred divergence function. These features are based on the divergence between the distribution of the pixel values of a lesion image, and that of the pixel values of either a benign or a malignant model. The features' sensitivities and specificities are reported, along with the contribution to an existing classifier for skin lesions. The features improve the performance of the existing classifier and are therefore relevant for melanoma detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Colour and Visual Computing Symposium (CVCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7270874/7274875/07274885.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 Colour and Visual Computing Symposium (CVCS)","doi":"10.1109/CVCS.2015.7274885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVCS.2015.7274885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Divergence-based colour features for melanoma detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lesions","Image color analysis","Malignant tumors","Feature extraction","Cancer","Sensitivity","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","cancer","feature extraction","image classification","image colour analysis","medical image processing","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["divergence-based colour features","melanoma detection","skin cancer","computer-aided diagnostic systems","dermoscopic images","Kullback-Leibler information","skin lesion classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Melanoma","Colour feature","Divergence","Kullback-Leibler","Gaussian mixture distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Divergence-based colour features for melanoma detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274885/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15476189","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-26 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Divergence-based colour features for melanoma detection","confLoc":"Gjovik, Norway","sourcePdf":"08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072314S","chronDate":"25-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7270874","isNumber":"7274875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7270874","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7274875","articleId":"7274885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7274907,"authors":[{"name":"Prakash Kumar","affiliation":["UCE Rajasthan Technical University, Kota, Rajasthan, India"],"bio":{"p":["Prakash Kumar: Presently he is PhD Scholar in Electrical Engineering Department, university college of Engg, Kota.

Field Oriented Control is a basic method in which real-time control of torque variations, rotor mechanical speed and phase currents can be possible. It controls the direct and quadrature axis currents to achieve required torque. The inverter switching pulses are generated using effective space vector pulse width modulation technique known as Centre Spaced Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (CSSVPWM). This modulation technique is a simple and easy method to generate pulses similar to Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) using the concept of effective time which reduces the complexity involved in calculation of angle and sector. The inverter output voltage can be directly synthesized by the effective times and the voltage modulation task can be greatly simplified. Three-level and Five-level diode-clamped inverter fed IPMSM analysis is done in MATLAB/SIMULINK.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Inverters","Torque","Complexity theory","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine vector control","permanent magnet motors","PWM invertors","synchronous motors","torque motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field oriented control","IPMSM","diode-clamped multilevel inverter","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","real-time control","torque variations","rotor mechanical speed","phase currents","inverter switching pulses","space vector pulse width modulation technique","centre spaced space vector pulse width modulation","voltage modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field Oriented Control (FOC)","Centre Spaced Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (CSSVPWM)","Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM)","Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPMSM)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPACE.2015.7274972","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Power and Advanced Control Engineering (ICPACE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Power and Advanced Control Engineering (ICPACE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7261093/7274905/07274972.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPACE.2015.7274972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Oriented Control of IPMSM using diode-clamped multilevel inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7274972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Field Oriented Control of IPMSM using diode-clamped multilevel inverter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7274972/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7274972/","accessionNumber":"15486722","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Oriented Control of IPMSM using diode-clamped multilevel inverter","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"RP066184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077087S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7261093","isNumber":"7274905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7261093","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7274905","articleId":"7274972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7275000,"authors":[{"name":"Rakesh Achar","affiliation":["SENSE DEPARTMENT, VIT University, Vellore, India"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Achar","id":"37085448011"},{"name":"A Rajesh","affiliation":["SENSE DEPARTMENT, VIT University, Vellore, India"],"firstName":"A","lastName":"Rajesh","id":"37421439800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1854-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1853-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275000","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Resource management","Delays","Downlink","Handover","Heterogeneous networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous resource allocations","LTE based femtocell networks","LTE-A","home evolved NodeB","HeNodeB","fair proportion","modified-largest weighted delay first","MLWDF","exponential scheduling","FP","ES"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-A","Resource allocations","Modified-Largest Weighted Delay First (MLWDF)","Femto-Marco","Heterogeneous Network"]}],"abstract":"Femto cell deployment creates a pre-dominate effects in the world of Long Terminal Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A). Such deployment in Marco cell will enhance the coverage up to a large extends into building premise. Also, it doesn't need any frequency planning. However, major concern with respect to the Femto deployment is its resource allocations along with Marco and mobility of Home evolved NodeB (HeNodeB) at the building premises. This Paper suggests a method of scheduling in Femto-Marco cell when frequent handover occur at the pedestrian speeds. This demands an improved scheduling in Marco cell and Femto cell. Hence, in this paper we investigate scheduling techniques, namely, Fair Proportion (FP), Modified-Largest Weighted Delay First (MLWDF) and Exponential Scheduling (ES). The performance of the network is analyses in term of spectral efficiency, throughput and delay, found to be more effective compare to existing method used in literature. Combined MLWDF-ES has 38% better spectral efficiency compared to the literature value.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of mobility in heterogeneous resource allocations for LTE based femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering and Technology (ICETECH)","doi":"10.1109/ICETECH.2015.7275000","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering and Technology (ICETECH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7270876/7274993/07275000.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETECH.2015.7275000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-20 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Impact of mobility in heterogeneous resource allocations for LTE based femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"20-20 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275000/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15486811","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of mobility in heterogeneous resource allocations for LTE based femtocell networks","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICETECHCS1023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058002S","chronDate":"20-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7270876","isNumber":"7274993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7270876","xplore-issue":"7274993","articleId":"7275000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275009,"authors":[{"name":"Vinit D.

It plays a vital role in storage and transfer of images over the web. Quality of image along with its size plays a vital role in various applications. Image compression in transform domain is one of the popular technique. This work presents use of 2-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT) along with a technique such as Multistage Vector Quantization (MSVQ) for compressing image. The codebook required in different stages of vector quantization (VQ) is generated using LBG algorithm. The neural network approach called Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network has been employed to provide training to the indices generated from MSVQ stages. Finally arithmetic coding is used for further encoding. The method tries to achieve the advantages provided by these techniques. The method is also applied on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and 2-Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-DCT) for comparison. The experiment is performed on six images of size 128*128 each. The results proved the better quality of image in terms of PSNR and acceptable compression ratio compared to other mentioned transforms. First image is split into number of tiles then each tile is applied with DWT resulting in number of sub-bands according to one, two or three levels of decomposition.","doi":"10.1109/ICETECH.2015.7275009","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering and Technology (ICETECH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7270876/7274993/07275009.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Engineering and Technology (ICETECH)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETECH.2015.7275009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing image compression with efficient transforms & multistage vector quantization using radial basis function neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Discrete wavelet transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Vector quantization","Neural networks","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","radial basis function networks","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compression","image quality","radial basis function neural network","2-dimensional discrete wavelet transform","2D-DWT","multistage vector quantization","MSVQ","VQ","LBG algorithm","RBF neural network","arithmetic coding","discrete cosine transform","2D-DCT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform","Multistage Vector Quantization","Radial Basis Function Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-20 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing image compression with efficient transforms & multistage vector quantization using radial basis function neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"20-20 March 2015","accessionNumber":"15486808","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing image compression with efficient transforms & multistage vector quantization using radial basis function neural network","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICETECHCS1238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070407S","chronDate":"20-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7270876","isNumber":"7274993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7270876","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7274993","articleId":"7275009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7275016,"authors":[{"name":"P.

CATCHA intends to generate a code which can only be identified by the human and machines cannot. In the real world, due to the massive increase in the usage of smart phones, tablets and other devices with the touch screen functionality poses a many online security threats. The traditional CAPTCHA requires a help of keyboard input and does dependant of language which will not be efficient in the smart phone devices. The face CAPTCHA is the one which intends to generate a CAPTCHA by using a combination of facial images and the fake images. It is based on generating a CAPTCHA with noised real face images and the fake images which cannot be identified by the machines but humans do. In the existing work, genetic algorithm is used to select the optimized face images by using which the better optimized fpso CAPTCHA can be created. However this work lacks from the local convergence problem where it can only select the best images within the local region. To overcome this problem in this work, the particle swarm optimization method is propose which can generate the globalize solution. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a popular and bionic algorithm based on the social behavior associated with bird flocking for optimization problems. The experimental tests that were conducted were proved that the proposed methodology improves in accuracy and generates an optimized solution than the existing methodologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-20 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275016/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15486792","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275016/","publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","conferenceDate":"20-20 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Face image captcha generation using particle swarm optimization approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face image captcha generation using particle swarm optimization approach","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICETECHCS658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042545S","chronDate":"20-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7270876","isNumber":"7274993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7270876","xplore-issue":"7274993","articleId":"7275016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275027,"authors":[{"name":"Ankita Mazumder","affiliation":["School of Bioscience and Engineering Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Ankita","lastName":"Mazumder","id":"37085447812"},{"name":"Arnab Rakshit","affiliation":["School of Bioscience and Engineering Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Arnab","lastName":"Rakshit","id":"37085721092"},{"name":"D.

The hybrid CDR is operated at half rate, which is incorporated into a broadband PLL to facilitate ISI and jitter suppression over wide-band operation. To accommodate different channel response, an automatic threshold tracking (ATT) circuit combining with sign-sign least mean square (LMS) adaptive engine is realized. A quadrature relaxation-type oscillator is proposed to provide the sampling phases without bulky inductors. It also provides the advantages of small form factor and wide range operation (19-27 Gbps) to compensate 20 dB channel loss at 12.5 GHz. Fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS technology, the whole receiver manifests an energy efficiency of 3.12 pJ/bit at 27 Gbps operation.

In this letter, we apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to enhance the achievable throughput in high-rate VLC downlink networks. We first propose a novel gain ratio power allocation (GRPA) strategy that considers the users' channel conditions to ensure efficient and fair power allocation. Our results indicate that the GRPA significantly enhances the system performance compared with the static power allocation. We also study the effect of tuning the transmission angles of the light emitting diodes and the field of views of the receivers, and demonstrate that these parameters can offer new degrees of freedom to boost the NOMA performance.

SGs feature multi-way communication among energy generation, transmission, distribution, and usage facilities. The reliable, efficient, and intelligent management of complex power systems requires integration of high-speed, reliable, and secure data information and communication technology into the SGs to monitor and regulate power generation and usage. Despite several challenges, such as trade-offs between wireless coverage and capacity as well as limited spectral resources in SGs, wireless communication is a promising SG communications technology. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) in particular are highly promising for providing timely SG wireless communications by utilizing all available spectrum resources. We provide in this paper a comprehensive survey on the CRN communication paradigm in SGs, including the system architecture, communication network compositions, applications, and CR-based communication technologies. We highlight potential applications of CR-based SG systems. We survey CR-based spectrum sensing approaches with their major classifications. We also provide a survey on CR-based routing and MAC protocols, and describe interference mitigation schemes. We furthermore present open issues and research challenges faced by CR-based SG networks along with future directions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15730369","htmlLink":"/document/7275088/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio for Smart Grids: Survey of Architectures, Spectrum Sensing Mechanisms, and Networking Protocols","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio for Smart Grids: Survey of Architectures, Spectrum Sensing Mechanisms, and Networking Protocols","sourcePdf":"comst-reisslein-2481722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.400866S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"238","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"7275088","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7275091,"authors":[{"name":"Ligang Gao","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ligang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085404646"},{"name":"Pai-Yu Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Pai-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085344760"},{"name":"Shimeng Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shimeng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085352683"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"7275091","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1009},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275091","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Programming","Protocols","Switches","Optimization","Stochastic processes","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","hafnium compounds","optimisation","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programming protocol optimization","analog weight tuning","resistive memories","multilevel operation","neuro-inspired computing","pulse amplitude incremental steps","pulsewidth incremental steps","start voltages","conductance tuning","over-reset behavior","stochastic nature","filament formation","filament rupture","1D filament model","HfOx"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRAM","multilevel","programming scheme"]},{"kwd":["RRAM","multilevel","programming scheme"]}],"abstract":"Analog weight tuning in resistive memories is attractive for multilevel operation and neuro-inspired computing.

Database-driven CRNs are regarded as a promising approach for dynamic and highly efficient spectrum management paradigm for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT). However, as a typical location-based service (LBS), before providing services to the user, there is no verification of the queried location, which is very vulnerable to location spoofing attack. A malicious user can report a fake location to the database and access the channels that may not be available for its location. This will introduce serious interference to the primary users (PUs). In this study, we identify a new kind of attack coined as location cheating attack, which allows an attacker to spoof other users to another location and make them query the database with wrong location, or allows a malicious user to forge location arbitrarily and query the database for services. To thwart this attack, we propose a novel infrastructure-based approach that relies on the existing WiFi or cellular network access points (or AP) to provide privacy-preserving location proof. With the proposed solution, the database can verify the locations without knowing the user's accurate location. We perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that our approach, besides providing location proofs effectively, can significantly improve the user's location privacy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2481926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7523345","startPage":"563","endPage":"571","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7523345/07275115.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Location Proof for Securing Large-Scale Database-Driven Cognitive Radio\u00a0Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275115/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Location Proof for Securing Large-Scale Database-Driven Cognitive Radio\u00a0Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16180597","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Tech R&D (863)","grantNumber":"2015AA01A707"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272444, U1401253, U1405251, 61411146001 and 61472418"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving Location Proof for Securing Large-Scale Database-Driven Cognitive Radio\u00a0Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-zhu-2481926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055752S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7523345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7523345","articleId":"7275115","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7275120,"authors":[{"name":"Shashindra Silva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7275120/silva-2481892-small.gif","p":["Shashindra Silva (S\u201910) received the B.Sc. degree in engineering (first class Hons.) from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2015.

Two novel relay selection strategies are proposed and analyzed here for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay networks (TWRNs) with spatial multiplexing. Specifically, they are designed to maximize the effective end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and thereby minimize the overall outage probability or maximize the achievable sum rate. Interestingly, the first strategy amounts to maximizing the minimum of the eigenvalues of the Wishart matrices from the selected relay to the two user nodes. Counter-intuitively, the latter strategy amounts to maximizing the minimum of the determinant of the same Wishart matrices. The performance of these two strategies is investigated by deriving lower/upper bounds of the overall outage probability and the average sum rate approximations in closed form. Further, the asymptotic high-SNR approximations of the outage probability are derived, and thereby, the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is quantified. This tradeoff reveals that whenever the sum of relay antennas is fixed, the achievable diversity order is always a constant, and hence, the multiplexing gain can indeed be improved by equally distributing antennas among the available set of relays. Our results reveal that relay selection indeed significantly alleviates the inherent diversity-gain loss associated with the use of available degrees of freedom for spatial multiplexing.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2481892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07275120.pdf","startPage":"4694","endPage":"4710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2481892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Selection Strategies for MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks With Spatial Multiplexing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275120/","displayDocTitle":"Relay Selection Strategies for MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks With Spatial Multiplexing","volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677223","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275120/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"TELUS Communications Company and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Selection Strategies for MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks With Spatial Multiplexing","sourcePdf":"tcomm-silva-2481892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104142S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7275120","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7275132,"authors":[{"name":"Basit Shafiq","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/8023000/7275132/shafi-2481881-small.gif","p":["Basit Shafiq is an assistant professor in the School of Science and\n Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Pakistan.

A key challenge related to composition of such multi-organizational business processes and workflows is posed by the security and access control policies of the underlying organizational domains. In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and

This antenna system is composed of a ground radiation antenna for Bluetooth applications and an adjacent slot for noise suppression. A loop-type circuit is used to model a noise source on the PCB to provide wide-frequency spectrum noise currents to analyze the noise performance of the high-sensitivity antenna system. Decoupling between the noise sources and the antenna port can lead to high sensitivity. An adjacent slot is designed as part of the system to improve the sensitivity, based on the decoupling theorem. This proposed system is effective and applicable for high-sensitivity antenna design, as verified through simulation and active measurements of Bluetooth headsets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275138/","accessionNumber":"15618586","displayDocTitle":"High-Sensitivity Ground Radiation Antenna System Using an Adjacent Slot for Bluetooth Headsets","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"MSIP/IITP","grantNumber":"B0101-15-1271"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Sensitivity Ground Radiation Antenna System Using an Adjacent Slot for Bluetooth Headsets","sourcePdf":"tap-kim-2481919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044375S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7337475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7337475","articleId":"7275138","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7275139,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Wallscheid","affiliation":["Department of Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/7410138/7275139/walls-small.gif","p":["Oliver Wallscheid (S'13) received the Bachelor and Master(Hons.)\n degrees in industrial engineering from the University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany, in 2010 and 2012,\n respectively.","Since then, he has been working as a Research Associate and also working toward the Doctoral degree at the\n Department of Power Electronics and Electrical Drives University of Paderborn.

A lumped-parameter thermal network (LPTN) consisting of four nodes is designed to model the most important motor parts, i.e., the stator yoke, stator winding, stator teeth, and the permanent magnets. An empirical approach based on the comprehensive experimental training data and a particle swarm optimization are used to identify the LPTN parameters of a 60-kW automotive traction PMSM. Varying parameters and physically motivated constraints are taken into account to extend the model scope beyond the training data domain. Here, a so-called global identification technique for linear parameter-varying systems is innovatively applied to a thermal motor model for the first time. The model accuracy is cross-validated with independent load profiles, and a maximum estimation error (worst-case) of 8\u00b0C regarding all considered motor temperatures is achieved. Also, a comprehensive residual statistical analysis proves suitable estimation results in terms of model robustness and accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15787050","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7275139/","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Global Identification of a Low-Order Lumped-Parameter Thermal Network for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Identification of a Low-Order Lumped-Parameter Thermal Network for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors","sourcePdf":"tec-wallscheid-2473673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093697S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7410138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7410138","articleId":"7275139","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":7275140,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Yu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7322317/7275140/yu-2481792-small.gif","p":["\n\nRong Yu (S'05\u2013M'08) received the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2007.","He is currently a Full Professor with the School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

In this paper, we consider the resource management and sharing problem for bandwidth and computing resources to support mobile applications in cloud-enabled vehicular networks. In such an environment, cloud service providers (SPs) can cooperate to form coalitions to share their idle resources with each other. We propose a coalition game model based on two-sided matching theory for cooperation among cloud SPs to share their idle resources. As a result, the resources can be better utilized, and the QoS for users can be improved. Numerical results indicate that our scheme can improve resource utilization and increase by 75% the QoS of the applications compared with that without cooperation. Moreover, the higher service cost of cooperation brings negative effect on coalition formation. The higher cooperation willingness of cloud SPs and the lower service cost support more service applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Resource Management in Cloud-Enabled Vehicular Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2481792","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7322317/07275140.pdf","startPage":"7938","endPage":"7951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2481792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Resource Management in Cloud-Enabled Vehicular Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7275140/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587093","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422201, 61370159, U1201253 and U1301255"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"S2011030002886"},{"fundingName":"Special-Support Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014TQ01X100"},{"fundingName":"High Education Excellent Young Teacher Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"YQ2013057"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"2014J2200097"},{"fundingName":"Zhujiang New Star Program","grantNumber":"240079/F20"},{"fundingName":"European Commission Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7)"},{"fundingName":"Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks (CROWN)","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-627490"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Resource Management in Cloud-Enabled Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2481792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181534S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7322317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7322317","articleId":"7275140","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7275142,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7275142/hyuan-2481888-small.gif","p":["Haifeng Yuan was born in Shenyang, China, in 1983.

The work generalizes the previous LLR derivations in [16]-[19], and demonstrates the necessity of the knowledge of the statistical channel model in the exact LLR computation. Assuming the channel is slowly time-varying, we also propose a simple approximate LLR metric based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), which requires only the information of the noise spectral density. The advantage of the newly derived PCMI-LLR metric over the approximate metric and the other LLR metrics in the literature is explained from the information-theoretic perspective via the generalized mutual information. Computer simulations are also provided to demonstrate the superiority of the PCMI-LLR metric in both error rate performance and convergence speed for iterative decoding of turbo and low-density parity-check codes in practical systems.

Approximate computing is a new class of techniques that relax the accuracy requirement of computing systems. In this paper, we present the Adaptive Coding for approximate Computing (ACOCO) framework, which provides us with an analysis-guided design methodology to develop adaptive codes for different computations on the data read from faulty memories. In ACOCO, we first compress the data by introducing distortion in the source encoder, and then add redundant bits to protect the data against memory errors in the channel encoder. We are thus able to protect the data against memory errors without additional memory overhead so that the coded data have the same bit-length as the uncoded data. We design the source encoder by first specifying a cost function measuring the effect of the data compression on the system output, and then design the source code according to this cost function. We develop adaptive codes for two types of systems under ACOCO. The first type of systems we consider, which includes many machine learning and graph-based inference systems, is the systems dominated by product operations. We evaluate the cost function statistics for the proposed adaptive codes, and demonstrate its effectiveness via two application examples: max-product image denoising and na\u00efve Bayesian classification. Next, we consider another type of systems: iterative decoders with min operation and sign-bit decision, which are widely applied in wireless communication systems. We develop an adaptive coding scheme for the min-sum decoder subject to memory errors. A density evolution analysis and simulations on finite length codes both demonstrate that the decoder with our adaptive code achieves a residual error rate that is on the order of the square of the residual error rate achieved by the nominal min-sum decoder.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275150/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677213","volume":"63","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"ACOCO: Adaptive Coding for Approximate Computing on Faulty Memories","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF 1029030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACOCO: Adaptive Coding for Approximate Computing on Faulty Memories","sourcePdf":"tcomm-dolecek-2481898-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102753S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7275150","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7275151,"authors":[{"name":"Changhai Liao","affiliation":["ASIC and System State Key Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7471560/7275151/liao-2481868-small.gif","p":["Changhai Liao received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from the School of Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2013.

Applying this method, HMT is introduced to set up a statistical model for coefficients after exploring the underlying correlated representation of the spatial variation in the frequency domain. Accordingly, two key inherent properties of the modeling coefficients, i.e., correlations and sparse presentations in the frequency domain, can be captured exactly and the modeling accuracy can be improved evidently. Then, maximum-a-posteriori estimation is applied to formulate the original problem as a convex optimization that could be solved efficiently and robustly. Numerical results based on industrial data demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior accuracy over other existing approaches including orthogonal matching pursuit, l\n<sub

However, the high variations of electromyogram signal patterns caused by arm position changes prohibit application to the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel method of decoding movement intentions robust to arm position changes towards proportional myoelectric interfaces. Specifically, we devise the position-independent decoding that estimates the likelihood of different arm positions, which we predefine during a training step, and also decodes the movement intention in a unified framework. The proposed method has an advantage that could be used to decode the movement intentions on untrained arm positions in a realistic scenario. Our experimental results showed that the proposed method could successfully decode the continuous movement intentions (e.g., flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation) on both trained and untrained arm positions. Our study also proved the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the existing methods in terms of the decoded trajectories as movement intentions in untrained arm positions.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2481461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2481461","startPage":"928","endPage":"939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/7560674/07275160.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7560674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Position-Independent Decoding of Movement Intention for Proportional Myoelectric Interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Position-Independent Decoding of Movement Intention for Proportional Myoelectric Interfaces","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2016","volume":"24","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275160/","accessionNumber":"16283564","pubMedId":"26415203","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275160/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1A2A1A05001867"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position-Independent Decoding of Movement Intention for Proportional Myoelectric Interfaces","sourcePdf":"tnsre-lee-2481461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135131S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"7560674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7560674","articleId":"7275160","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7275162,"authors":[{"name":"Lingkun Fu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7275162/fu-2481920-small.gif","p":["\n\nLingkun Fu (S'13\u2013M'15) is currently working toward the Ph.D. \ndegree with the Group of Networked Sensing and Control (IIPC-NesC), State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control \nTechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.","His research interests include optimization for wireless rechargeable sensor networks, mobile computing, and \ncyberphysical systems."]},"firstName":"Lingkun","lastName":"Fu","id":"37072243800"},{"name":"Liang He","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration, Southeast University, Ministry of Education, Beijing, MI, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7275162/he-2481920-small.gif","p":["\n\nLiang He (S'09\u2013M'12) received the B.Eng. degree from Tianjin \nUniversity, Tianjin, China, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree from Nankai University, Tianjin, in 2011.","He is currently a Research Fellow with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Different from energy harvesting, which generates dynamic energy supply, the mobile charger is able to provide a stable and reliable energy supply for sensor nodes and, thus, enables sustainable system operations. While previous mobile charging protocols focus on either the charger travel distance or the charging delay of sensor nodes, in this work, we propose a novel energy synchronized mobile charging (ESync) protocol, which simultaneously reduces both of them. Observing the limitation of traveling salesman problem (TSP)-based solutions, when the nodes' energy consumption is diverse, we construct a set of nested TSP tours based on their energy consumption, and only nodes with low remaining energy are involved in each charging round. Furthermore, we propose the concept of energy synchronization to synchronize the charging request sequence of nodes with their sequence on the TSP tours. Experimentation and simulation demonstrate that ESync can reduce charger travel distance and nodes' charging delay by about 30% and 40%, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07275162.pdf","startPage":"7415","endPage":"7431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2481920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2481920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"<i>ESync</i>: Energy Synchronized Mobile Charging in Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Energy consumption","Delays","Synchronization","Protocols","Energy states","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","telecommunication power supplies","travelling salesman problems","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traveling salesman problem","rechargeable wireless sensor networks","energy synchronized mobile charging","ESync"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy synchronization","mobile charger","on-demand energy replenishment","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"<i>ESync</i>: Energy Synchronized Mobile Charging in Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7275162/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16305969","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1401253 and 61473251"},{"fundingName":"National Program for Special Support of Top Notch Young Professionals"},{"fundingName":"ZJNSF","grantNumber":"LY14F030016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University), Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"K93-9-2015-02B"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<italic>ESync</italic>: Energy Synchronized Mobile Charging in Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2481920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130748S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7275162","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7275165,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Peng","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology and the School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7742433/7275165/cpeng-2481821-small.gif","p":["Chen Peng (M\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Chinese University of Mining Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2002.","From September 2002 to August 2004, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Applied Mathematics at Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.

In this paper, we develop a distributed market framework to price the offloading service, and conduct a detailed analysis of the incentives for offloading service providers and conflicts arising from the interactions of different participators. Specifically, we formulate a multileader multifollower Stackelberg game (MLMF-SG) to model the interactions between the offloading service providers and the offloading service consumers in the considered market framework, and investigate the cases where the offloading capacity of APs is unlimited and limited, respectively. For the case without capacity limit, we decompose the followers' game of the MLMF-SG (FG-MLMF-SG) into a number of simple follower games (FGs), and prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the FGs from which the existence and uniqueness of the FG-MLMF-SG also follows. For the leaders' game of the MLMF-SG, we also prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium. For the case with capacity limit, by considering a symmetric strategy profile, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the corresponding MLMF-SG, and present a distributed algorithm that allows the leaders to achieve the equilibrium. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the Stackelberg equilibrium is very close to the corresponding social optimum for both considered cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07275166.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2480394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2480394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing Mobile Data Offloading: A Distributed Market Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Mobile communication","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Radio frequency","Pricing","Mobile computing","Femtocells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","marketing data processing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pricing mobile data offloading","distributed market framework","mobile data offloading","cellular networks","user satisfaction","offloading service","multileader multifollower Stackelberg game","MLMF-SG","offloading service consumers","symmetric strategy profile","distributed algorithm","Stackelberg equilibrium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Traffic Offloading","Stackelberg Game","WiFi Offloading","Nash Equilibrium"]},{"kwd":["Mobile traffic offloading","Stackelberg game","wifi offloading","nash equilibrium"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Pricing Mobile Data Offloading: A Distributed Market Framework","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7275166/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15785905","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61303027 and 61372095"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2015CFB585"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006066","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China","grantNumber":"4-BCBG"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","grantNumber":"Green-Dyspan ANR-12-IS03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing Mobile Data Offloading: A Distributed Market Framework","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2480394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094707S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7275166","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7275174,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7313073/7275174/zhang-2481797-small.gif","p":["Meng Zhang (S\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, in 2015.

Assuming equal power allocation across subcarriers, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the aggregate harvested power of all users while satisfying secrecy rate requirements of individual users by joint subcarrier allocation and power splitting ratio selection. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose two suboptimal algorithms to solve the problem. The first one is an iterative algorithm that optimizes subcarrier allocation and power splitting ratios by an alternating way in dual domain. The second algorithm is based on a two-step approach that allocates subcarriers and selects power splitting ratios sequentially. The numerical results show that the proposed methods outperform the conventional methods and provide good trade offs between performance and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2481797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2481797","startPage":"154","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics

Fortunately, these wafer defects leave unique patterns due to their spatial dependence across wafer maps. It is thus possible to identify and predict them in order to find the point of failure in the manufacturing process accurately. This paper introduces a novel simplified subspaced regression framework for the accurate and efficient identification of defect patterns in semiconductor wafer maps. It can achieve a test error comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML)-based methods, while maintaining a low computational cost when dealing with large-scale wafer data.

However, the common assumption that signals from different directions share the spectral band is inappropriate when they occupy different bands. To flexibly deal with this situation, a novel wideband DOA estimation algorithm is proposed to simultaneously infer the band occupation and estimate high-resolution DOAs by leveraging the sparsity in the angular domain. The band occupation is exploited by exerting a Dirichlet process (DP) prior over the latent parametric space. Moreover, the proposed method is extended to deal with the off-grid problem by two schemes. One applies a linear approximation to the true dictionary and infers the hidden variables and parameters by the variational Bayesian expectation-maximization (VBEM) in an integrated manner. The other is the separated scheme where DOA is refined by a postsearching procedure based on the reconstructed results. Since the proposed schemes can automatically partition the sub-bands into clusters according to their underlying occupation, more accurate DOA estimation can be achieved by using the measurements within one cluster. Results of comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform other reported ones.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2481790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7358222/07275186.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2481790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Wideband DOA Estimation Based on Sparse Bayesian Learning With Dirichlet Process Priors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Novel Wideband DOA Estimation Based on Sparse Bayesian Learning With Dirichlet Process Priors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275186/","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15663178","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275186/","volume":"64","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Wideband DOA Estimation Based on Sparse Bayesian Learning With Dirichlet Process Priors","sourcePdf":"tsp-bi-2481790-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131827S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7358222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7358222","articleId":"7275186","onlineDate":"24 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7275189,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Therefore, energy efficient or green communication has become a very hot topic under the ground of limited energy resource and environmentally friendly transmission schemes. MIMO technique is capable of reducing the transmission power thanks to its diversity and multiplexing gain. Moreover, antenna selection (AS) is an alternative to extract many of the benefits in MIMO systems with a reduced cost of complexity and power. Although many works including several survey papers have investigated AS in MIMO systems, the goal of these works is only the capacity maximization or error rate minimization, which fails to guarantee the optimality of the energy efficiency in MIMO systems. In this paper, we overview the state of the art in the AS schemes in energy efficient MIMO systems, the goal of which is to optimize the energy efficiency of the whole system. Specifically, we introduce energy efficient AS in point-to-point MIMO, cooperative MIMO, multiuser MIMO and largescale MIMO systems, respectively. Several challenging and practical issues in this area are also addressed.","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7275245/07275254.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"173","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7275254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7275254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invited Paper: Antenna selection in energy efficient MIMO systems: A survey","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Energy efficiency","Transmitting antennas","Diversity reception","Diversity methods","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna selection","energy efficient","holistic power model","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Invited Paper: Antenna selection in energy efficient MIMO systems: A survey","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invited Paper: Antenna selection in energy efficient MIMO systems: A survey","sourcePdf":"17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063659S","chronDate":"2015","isNumber":"7275245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"7","articleId":"7275254","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275257,"authors":[{"name":"Mingchuan Yang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Mingchuan","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Yuan Li","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Liu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Wenyan Tang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Wenyan","lastName":"Tang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7275257","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":582},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Time-frequency analysis","Correlation","Electromagnetics","Detection algorithms","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","feature extraction","Hilbert transforms","radio networks","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclostationary feature detection","spectrum sensing algorithm","complicated electromagnetic environment","cognitive radio networks","licensed user signal","Hilbert transformation","computational complexity","cyclic frequency","received signal","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","cyclostationary feature detection","Hilbert transformation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclostationary feature detection based spectrum sensing algorithm under complicated electromagnetic environment in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7275257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275245","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7275245/07275257.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7275257","startPage":"35","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275257","abstract":"This paper focuses on improving the detection performance of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) networks under complicated electromagnetic environment. Some existing fast spectrum sensing algorithms cannot get specific features of the licensed users' (LUs') signal, thus they cannot be applied in this situation without knowing the power of noise. On the other hand some algorithms that yield specific features are too complicated. In this paper, an algorithm based on the cyclostationary feature detection and theory of Hilbert transformation is proposed. Comparing with the conventional cyclostationary feature detection algorithm, this approach is more flexible i.e. it can flexibly change the computational complexity according to current electromagnetic environment by changing its sampling times and the step size of cyclic frequency. Results of simulation indicate that this approach can flexibly detect the feature of received signal and provide satisfactory detection performance compared to existing approaches in low Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR) situations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475117","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationary feature detection based spectrum sensing algorithm under complicated electromagnetic environment in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationary feature detection based spectrum sensing algorithm under complicated electromagnetic environment in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058444S","chronDate":"2015","isNumber":"7275245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"9","articleId":"7275257","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275259,"authors":[{"name":"Chengwen Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Chengwen","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Danli Li","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Danli","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xuezhi Tan","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Xuezhi","lastName":"Tan"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7275259","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":601},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Silicon carbide","Multiuser detection","Computational complexity","MIMO","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","computational complexity","error statistics","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO-OFDM system","low complexity multiuser detection","recursively successive zero-forcing","MU-MIMO technology","successive interference cancellation","block diagonalization","cochannel interference","nullspace orthogonal theorem","computational complexity","singular value decomposition","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","MU-MIMO","multiuser detection","co-channel interference cancellation","block diagonalization","successive interference cancellation"]}],"abstract":"To improve the spectrum efficiency, this paper considers the multiuser detection with the MU-MIMO technology for multiuser MIMO-OFDM system uplink with the same subcarrier shared by multiple users.

The RSZF process based on the block diagonalization (BD) technique eliminates the co-channel interference (CCI) by a recursive method based on the nullspace orthogonal theorem. The SIC process detects the user signals respectively with the reasonable user detection sequence based on the results of the RSZF process.

In this case, the traditional statistical methods for anomalous cell detection cannot adapt to the evolution of networks, and data mining becomes the mainstream. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel density-based local outlier factor (KLOF) to assign a degree of being an outlier to each object. Firstly, the notion of KLOF is introduced, which captures exactly the relative degree of isolation. Then, by analyzing its properties, including the tightness of upper and lower bounds, sensitivity of density perturbation, we find that KLOF is much greater than 1 for outliers. Lastly, KLOF is applied on a real-world dataset to detect anomalous cells with abnormal key performance indicators (KPIs) to verify its reliability. The experiment shows that KLOF can find outliers efficiently. It can be a guideline for the operators to perform faster and more efficient trouble shooting.","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7275245/07275260.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7275260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7275260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous cell detection with kernel density-based local outlier factor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Clustering algorithms","Data mining","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Big data","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data mining","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["KLOF","abnormal key performance indicators","real-world dataset","density perturbation","data mining","statistical methods","data transmission","mobile network","kernel density-based local outlier factor","anomalous cell detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data mining","key performance indicators","kernel density-based local outlier factor","density perturbation","anomalous cell detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous cell detection with kernel density-based local outlier factor","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15484841","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous cell detection with kernel density-based local outlier factor","sourcePdf":"7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025174S","chronDate":"2015","isNumber":"7275245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7275260","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275293,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Lun","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Lun","id":"38554399000"},{"name":"Lei Shen","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085740846"},{"name":"Yingying Cong","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yingying","lastName":"Cong","id":"37075491200"},{"name":"Gang Du","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Du","id":"37270807400"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280578200"},{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085749299"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8634-8538-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4636"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4644"}],"articleNumber":"7275293","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":573},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the impact of grain boundary on threshold voltage of 3-D MLC NAND flash memory","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop (SNW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259952/7275273/07275293.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2015 Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop (SNW)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275273","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memories","Logic gates","Voltage control","Grain boundaries","Computer architecture","Threshold voltage","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","grain boundaries","interface states","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grain boundary","threshold voltage","multilevel cell NAND flash memory","3D MLC NAND flash memory","2D NAND flash","storage density","polycrystalline silicon","poly-Si","interface traps"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275293","abstract":"Three-dimensional (3-D) NAND flash technology has been attracting much attention in recent years, for it overcomes the challenges of scaling limitation faced by 2-D NAND flash and meets the demand of higher storage density and lower bit cost.

These installations are becoming very dense in order to support the users' requirements (especially 5G networks) which make resource allocation using the same spectrum a very challenging problem. In this study, we address the downlink resource allocation problem for underlay small cell tier. We formulate the optimization problem for resource (channel) allocation in small cells while keeping the total interference to macro tier under an acceptable level. The objective of resource allocation is to maximize the throughput of small cells under the cross tier interference constraint. We employ matching theory to find a stable match for the resource allocation problem. We simulate our proposition to validate the stability of the network and the convergence of the resource allocation algorithm in terms of rate in a dense heterogeneous network. The matching results in an optimal solution which outperforms the existing sub-optimal resource allocation solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource management in dense heterogeneous networks","publicationTitle":"2015 17th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2015.7275383","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7270534/7275336/07275383.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2015.7275383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Resource management in dense heterogeneous networks","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275383/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487501","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource management in dense heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05663S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7270534","isNumber":"7275336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7270534","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7275336","articleId":"7275383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275390,"authors":[{"name":"Khamdamboy Urunov","affiliation":["Kookmin university, Financial Information Security, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Khamdamboy","lastName":"Urunov","id":"37085649654"},{"name":"Jung-Il Namgung","affiliation":["Kookmin university, Financial Information Security, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Il","lastName":"Namgung","id":"37564157900"},{"name":"Soo-Hyun Park","affiliation":["Kookmin university, Financial Information Security, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Soo-Hyun","lastName":"Park","id":"37559871200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2296-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275390","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"abstract":"The paper considers Machine to Machine (M2M) different access methods are analyses to determine their security aspects.

Since the user's service duration may be greater than the coverage time of a LEO satellite, the user may be handed over to another visible satellite to prevent interruption of the ongoing communication. On the other hand, a mobile user may be covered by more than one satellite at the instant of connection handover. When the user is about to be handed over to another satellite, the serving satellite minimizing the number of handovers would in general be the one that provides the largest service time which is not necessarily equal to the coverage time of the very satellite. In this paper, we propose a new handover algorithm which exploits both the Global Positioning System (GPS) infrastructure and satellite diversity to provide a simple and real-time handover management in LEO satellite networks. The proposed algorithm not only minimizes the expected number of satellite handover, but is also efficient and easy to be implemented in hand-held devices, thus facilitating the mobile users' access to the satellite networks. Numerical simulations performed for two typical mobile satellite networks, viz. Iridium and Globalstar, corroborate the advantages gained by the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2015.7275422","publicationTitle":"2015 17th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7270534/7275336/07275422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2015.7275422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275336","startPage":"175","endPage":"179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple real-time handover management in the mobile satellite communication networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simple real-time handover management in the mobile satellite communication networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275422/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487480","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275422/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple real-time handover management in the mobile satellite communication networks","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TS34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050708S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7270534","isNumber":"7275336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7270534","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7275336","articleId":"7275422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275445,"authors":[{"name":"Sarder Fakhrul Abedin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Korea"],"firstName":"Sarder Fakhrul","lastName":"Abedin","id":"37085447450"},{"name":"Md.

Our study also focuses on solving parking problem to relieve the traffic congestion, reduce air pollution and enhance driving effectively. However, unlike other studies, we consider parking problem in the view of IoT. From this perspective, Fog Computing and Roadside Cloud are utilized to find a vacant spot. By utilizing this infrastructures, any parking space at many places can be shared. Then, we analyze and apply the matching theory to solve the parking problem. Accordingly, our proposal not only helps drivers finding an ideal available space but also brings the owners of these places profit.

Algorithms for detecting steps and estimating their length can be found throughout the literature. In this paper we present new algorithms that increase the accuracy of the estimated step length and decrease the number of undetected steps. Unlike state of the art algorithms, that use the acceleration to detect steps and the frequency or the acceleration to estimate the step length, we propose the use of the opening angle of the pedestrian's leg. An experiment with 18 volunteers was conducted in order to prove the relationship between the opening angle of the leg and the step length. Our results show that the estimation of the step length is robust against speed changes and the trajectory's estimated length has less than 1% error. Our step detector outperforms state of the art algorithms by presenting a higher step detection rate in challenging scenarios. In conclusion, it is possible and convenient to make use of the opening angle of the leg and its relationship with the step length.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269216/7275453/07275473.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275473","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275473","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275473","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Acceleration","Legged locomotion","Estimation","Accuracy","Indoor navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial navigation","pedestrians","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["step detector","inertial pocket navigation system","smartphone","pedestrian positioning application","step length estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pedestrian","dead reckoning","pitch","opening angle of the leg","gait"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275473/","displayDocTitle":"Step detector and step length estimator for an inertial pocket navigation system","accessionNumber":"15487302","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7275473/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Step detector and step length estimator for an inertial pocket navigation system","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"2A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04352S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7269216","isNumber":"7275453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269216","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7275453","articleId":"7275473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7275487,"authors":[{"name":"Dezhi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Dezhi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085627292"},{"name":"Guoping Qiu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Guoping","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085460970"},{"name":"Yupeng Gao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Yupeng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085610827"},{"name":"Xiong Fang","affiliation":["Locision Co., Ltd, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085610117"},{"name":"Rui Cheng","affiliation":["Locision Co., Ltd, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085611197"},{"name":"Andy Chang","affiliation":["Locision Co., Ltd, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085628475"},{"name":"Chuen-Yu Chan","affiliation":["Locision Co., Ltd, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Chuen-Yu","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085609027"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8054-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275487","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"abstract":"Calibrations for Wi-Fi Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) are expensive and time-consuming.

Calibration-on-demand is desirable to reduce the maintenance cost and to enhance the reliability of the Wi-Fi IPS. Wi-Fi IPS degrades only when the radio map changes significantly and lastingly. Such changes are caused by radio map anomalous events. Examples of these events include changes in indoor environment, existence of spurious data from the sensing system and unexpected failure in utility infrastructures. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of a crowdsourcing online Wi-Fi radio map anomalous event detection system. Detection of these events will enhance the operation intelligence of Wi-Fi IPS and enable high-level context-aware services. This system is consisted of an outlier detector for abnormal signal identification and an event discriminator for determination of event occurrence. Real world smartphone data and simulated data are used to test the performance of the system. Initial results show that the system is able to detect over 92% of simulated events and 87.5% of real world events with a low false alarm rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269216/7275453/07275487.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"229","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowdsourcing based radio map anomalous event detection system for calibration-on-demand","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Indoor navigation","Detectors","Event detection","Fingerprint recognition","Mathematical model","Crowdsourcing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","computer network reliability","cost reduction","indoor navigation","indoor radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","signal detection","smart phones","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowdsourcing based radio map anomalous event detection system","calibration-on-demand","Wi-Fi indoor positioning system","recalibration","drift compensation","maintenance cost reduction","reliability enhancement","Wi-Fi IPS","indoor environment","sensing system","unexpected failure","utility infrastructure","high level context-aware service","outlier detector","abnormal signal identification","event discriminator","event occurrence determination","smartphone","false alarm rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wi-Fi","Indoor Positioning System","Calibration-on-demand","Crowdsourcing","Anomalous Event Detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Crowdsourcing based radio map anomalous event detection system for calibration-on-demand","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275487/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"15487314","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowdsourcing based radio map anomalous event detection system for calibration-on-demand","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089464S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7269216","isNumber":"7275453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269216","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7275453","articleId":"7275487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275492,"authors":[{"name":"Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Sospedra","affiliation":["Institute of New Imaging Technologies, Universitat Jaume I, Castell\u00f3n, Spain"],"firstName":"Joaqu\u00edn","lastName":"Torres-Sospedra","id":"38276126600"},{"name":"Ra\u00fal Montoliu","affiliation":["Institute of New Imaging Technologies, Universitat Jaume I, Castell\u00f3n, Spain"],"firstName":"Ra\u00fal","lastName":"Montoliu","id":"37726222600"},{"name":"Adolfo Mart\u00ednez-Us\u00f3","affiliation":["Institute of New Imaging Technologies, Universitat Jaume I, Castell\u00f3n, Spain"],"firstName":"Adolfo","lastName":"Mart\u00ednez-Us\u00f3","id":"38294031900"},{"name":"Joan P.

In this paper we present a systematic benchmarking methodology that is focused on gaining finegrained insight about the relative contributions of the individual phases of the fingerprinting-based localization algorithms to their overall performance. To this end, we decompose the localization algorithms in common phases (collection of raw measurements, creation of fingerprints, pattern matching and post-processing) and systematically asses the performance of different procedures that can be applied in each of these phases. We illustrate the application of the proposed methodology using a comprehensive experimental case-study of 3 WiFi fingerprinting algorithms with 4 raw RSSI collection procedures, 3 fingerprint creation and pattern matching procedures, 4 different post-processing procedures in 3 testbeds and 4 evaluation scenarios, resulting in 36 individual experiments. The results demonstrate that in the evaluated scenarios, a lower number of WiFi APs and rather simple fingerprint creation and pattern matching can achieve better performance in terms of location accuracy than more sophisticated alternatives. The results also show that postprocessing steps like k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) procedure are indeed effective in reducing the localization error variability and extremes, thus increasing the stability of the location estimation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Runtime","Pattern matching","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Phase measurement","Wireless communication","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern matching","RSSI","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprinting-based localization algorithms","ad-hoc evaluation","black-box comparison","benchmarking methodology","pattern matching","WiFi fingerprinting algorithms","RSSI","WiFi AP","k-Nearest Neighbours"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["indoor localization","WiFi fingerprinting algorithms","WiFi beacon packets","Received Signal Strength Indicator","fingerprinting phases"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275503","startPage":"355","endPage":"364","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269216/7275453/07275503.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental decomposition of the performance of fingerprinting-based localization algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Experimental decomposition of the performance of fingerprinting-based localization algorithms","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15487382","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275503/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental decomposition of the performance of fingerprinting-based localization algorithms","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072902S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7269216","isNumber":"7275453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269216","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7275453","articleId":"7275503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7275513,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

To realize self-localization for such autonomous robots, we aim to measure the indoor position of a moving object by using signal tracking with spread-spectrum (SS) ultrasonic signals. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of distance measurements using signal tracking of SS ultrasonic signals using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). To detect the SS ultrasonic signals, we perform correlation calculations between a range of received waves and a similar range of replica signals identical to the transmitted SS signals. Conventional positioning systems using SS signals employ signal acquisition to calculate the coordinates of objects from correlation values and signal tracking to measure the relative shift of distances of moving objects. After investigating the signal acquisition method, we found that 3-D positioning with an error of 50 mm was possible, even when transmitting simulcast ultrasonic signals with CDMA. Other studies using our proposed signal tracking method for moving targets without CDMA have maintained correlation values using a limited correlation range for correlation calculations, though they have yielded reduced correlation values for unmoving targets. In this paper, we develop a signal tracking method using the simulcasting of multiple signals with CDMA and discuss its effectiveness. We conduct an experiment on distance measurements to determine the method's measurable range and measurement error. We perform ten measurements of distances from 1000 to 6000 mm between a transmitter and a receiver, in 1000 mm intervals, using 50% of the correlation range. The results indicate an average measurement error of 11 mm, which is less than that of conventional signal acquisition methods.","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275530","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269216/7275453/07275530.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275453","startPage":"575","endPage":"581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy of distance measurements using signal tracking of spread-spectrum ultrasonic waves with CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy of distance measurements using signal tracking of spread-spectrum ultrasonic waves with CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275530/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"15487347","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275530/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy of distance measurements using signal tracking of spread-spectrum ultrasonic waves with CDMA","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"7C1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074543S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7269216","isNumber":"7275453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269216","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7275453","articleId":"7275530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275538,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this work a positioning solution able to localize the user based on data measured with a mobile device is described and evaluated. The position estimate uses data from smartphone built-in sensors, WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) adapter and map information of the indoor environment (e.g. walls and obstacles). A probability map derived from statistical information of the users tracked location over a period of time in the test scenario is generated and embedded in a map graph, in order to correct and combine the position estimates under a Bayesian representation. PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning), beacon-based Weighted Centroid position estimates, map information obtained from building OpenStreetMap XML representation and probability map users path density are combined using a Particle Filter and implemented in a smartphone application. Based on evaluations, this work verifies that the use of smartphone hardware components, map data and its semantic information represented in the form of a OpenStreetMap structure provide 2.48 meters average error after 1,700 travelled meters and a scalable indoor positioning solution. The Particle Filter algorithm used to combine various sources of information, its radio WiFi-based observation, probability particle weighting process and the mapping approach allowing the inclusion of new indoor environments knowledge show a promising approach for an extensible indoor navigation system.","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275538","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269216/7275453/07275538.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275538","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","startPage":"636","endPage":"645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrian indoor positioning using smartphone multi-sensing, radio beacons, user positions probability map and IndoorOSM floor plan representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian indoor positioning using smartphone multi-sensing, radio beacons, user positions probability map and IndoorOSM floor plan representation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275538/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275538/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"15487359","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian indoor positioning using smartphone multi-sensing, radio beacons, user positions probability map and IndoorOSM floor plan representation","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"8A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059437S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7269216","isNumber":"7275453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269216","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7275453","articleId":"7275538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7275546,"authors":[{"name":"Bonhyun Koo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Bonhyun","lastName":"Koo","id":"37085535308"},{"name":"Sangwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085542187"},{"name":"Myungsu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Myungsu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085468536"},{"name":"Dongkeon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dongkeon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085360802"},{"name":"Sangsun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangsun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085764909"},{"name":"Sunwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sunwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"38189639000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8054-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275546","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Kalman filters","Databases","Position measurement","Current measurement","Phase measurement","IEEE 802.11 Standard"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","least squares approximations","pattern clustering","pedestrians","recursive estimation","RSSI","smart phones","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PDR-fingerprinting fusion indoor location tracking","RSS recovery","RSS clustering","received signal strength","Wi-Fi indoor positioning technique","Kalman filter-based positioning algorithm","pedestrian dead reckoning","RSS-based fingerprinting positioning","recursive least square estimation","Android-based smartphone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiFi network","fingerprinting","clustering","RSS","IMU"]}],"abstract":"Due to the received signal strength (RSS) variation, WiFi indoor positioning techniques using RSS have difficulties to provide good location estimates. To mitigate the effect of the RSS variation, this paper presents a Kalman filter-based positioning algorithm that is combined with pedestrian dead reckoning and RSS-based fingerprinting positioning. The RSS recovery and clustering methods are also introduced to enhance the accuracy of the fingerprinting positioning. Unlike other existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm estimates biases accumulated in RSS measurements based on the recursive least square estimation and removes them from the measurements. Reference points are effectively selected with clustering using the recovered RSS measurements. Hence, a more accurate location estimate can be obtained in the existence of the RSS variation. The proposed algorithm is implemented into an Android-based smartphone for test.","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275546","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269216/7275453/07275546.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275453","startPage":"699","endPage":"704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PDR/fingerprinting fusion indoor location tracking using RSS recovery and clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PDR/fingerprinting fusion indoor location tracking using RSS recovery and clustering","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275546/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"15487292","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275546/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PDR/fingerprinting fusion indoor location tracking using RSS recovery and clustering","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"8D1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046246S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7269216","isNumber":"7275453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269216","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7275453","articleId":"7275546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7275561,"authors":[{"name":"Cheol Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Cheol","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085662055"},{"name":"Jaewoo So","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jaewoo","lastName":"So","id":"37293500300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8054-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275561","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Indoor navigation","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","indoor navigation","indoor radio","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensing-throughput-positioning tradeoff","indoor cognitive radio network","secondary user","SU","primary user positioning","PU positioning","cooperative spectrum sensing","frame duration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor cognitive radio","indoor PU positioning","cooperative spectrum sensing","sensing-throughput tradeoff"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275561","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275561","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","abstract":"This paper evaluates the performance of indoor cognitive networks in terms of the throughput and the positioning, according to the spectrum sensing time. A better sensing quality can be obtained by using a longer sensing time. The better sensing quality of a secondary user (SU), the more accurate information about a primary user (PU) positioning. However, there exists a tradeoff between the sensing quality and the achievable throughput. In the previous works, the achievable throughput has been derived under the assumption that the PU has a constant occupancy state during the entire frame duration. Actually, however, the state of PUs varies during the entire frame duration. We exploit a cooperative spectrum sensing for better observation on the PU positioning. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme gets more reliable positioning performance and better achievable throughput compare to those of previous works.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275453","startPage":"762","endPage":"765","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269216/7275453/07275561.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing-throughput/positioning tradeoff in indoor cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7275561/","displayDocTitle":"Sensing-throughput/positioning tradeoff in indoor cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"15487317","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing-throughput/positioning tradeoff in indoor cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073345S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7269216","isNumber":"7275453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269216","xplore-issue":"7275453","articleId":"7275561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275583,"authors":[{"name":"V.

An attempt is made to optimize the placement of light emitting diodes (LED) VLC emitter in 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO configuration at ceiling and ground floor for the receiver to obtain uniform signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the desired bit error rate (BER) in the given area. The system is also optimized for the necessary power transmission from LED emitters for the maximum data rate. Two channel coding techniques repetition code (RC) and spatial modulation (SM) are analyzed and their BER and data rate performance results are presented for different receiver spacing moving in the entire area. The result shows that RC gives almost constant SNR whereas SM offers better SNR ratio for more spacing between receivers. In the case of SM, only one transmitter will transmit at a time. So the SNR value will be very low at other corner of the room.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275591.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel coding performance of optical MIMO indoor visible light communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Light emitting diodes","MIMO","Optical receivers","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","indoor radio","light emitting diodes","MIMO communication","optical modulation","optical receivers","optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical MIMO indoor visible light communication channel coding performance","LED VLC emitter","light emitting diode VLC emitter","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","bit error rate","BER","repetition code","RC","spatial modulation","SM","muliple input multiple output communication","transmitter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible Light Communication","Muliple Input Multiple Output","Optical Wireless Communication","Line of Sight","Repetition Coding","Spatial Modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Channel coding performance of optical MIMO indoor visible light communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275591/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487225","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel coding performance of optical MIMO indoor visible light communication","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP0171570140809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047764S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275600,"authors":[{"name":"Sandesh R.S.","affiliation":["SENSE, VIT University, Chennai, TamilNadu"],"lastName":"Sandesh R.S.","id":"37085743358"},{"name":"Nithya Venkatesan","affiliation":["SELECT, VIT University, Chennai, TamilNadu"],"firstName":"Nithya","lastName":"Venkatesan","id":"38247546700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275600","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Electrodes","Electrocardiography","Signal to noise ratio","Electromyography","Immune system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","electrocardiography","electroencephalography","electromyography","medical signal processing","preamplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipurpose single channel bio signal amplifier implementation","ECG recording","clinical applications","dry electrode","amplifiers INA 217","signal extraction","SNR","EEG recording","EMG recording"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multipurpose","Bio Signal Amplifier","SNR","EEG","Performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275600","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275600.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of multipurpose single channel bio signal amplifier","abstract":"In this study the authors have designed a multipurpose single channel bio signal amplifier for recording of ECG/EEG/EMG for clinical applications.

The major concern in the system is inter symbol interference (ISI) caused by the channel. An equalizer is deployed on the receiver side to detract the effect of ISI. In this paper, simulation is done under the Rayleigh fading environment for linear equalization techniques for MIMO systems. Result shows that ISI occurred by the channel can effectively diminished with the help of Inter Equalization techniques. In the present article, a combined method is developed for canceling the interference with lower bit error rate and diminishing the effect of noise enhancement. The results show that, performance of this technique is comparatively better than conventional techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of MIMO systems under multipath fading channels using linear equalization techniques","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275607","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275607.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of MIMO systems under multipath fading channels using linear equalization techniques","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275607/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487050","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of MIMO systems under multipath fading channels using linear equalization techniques","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP0331570131501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096164S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275608,"authors":[{"name":"Varun Tiwari","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India"],"firstName":"Varun","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37085635874"},{"name":"Vijay Anand","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Anand","id":"37089114841"},{"name":"A.

In it mostly hands are moved in a particular way which along with some facial expression produces a meaningful thought which the speaker would like to convey to others. Using the sign language people with speaking and hearing disabilities can communicate with others who know the language very easily but it becomes difficult when it comes to interacting with a normal person. As a result there is a requirement of an intermediate system which will help in improving the interaction between people with the hearing disabilities as well as with the normal people. In this paper we present a sign language recognition technique using kinect depth camera and neural network. Using the kinect camera we obtain the image of the person standing in front of the camera and then we crop the hand region from the depth image and pre-process that image using the morphological operations to remove unwanted region from the hand image and find the contour of the hand sign and from the particular contour position of the hand we generate a signal on which Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied and first 200 DCT coefficient of the signal are feed to the neural network for training and classification and finally the network classify and recognize the sign. A data set of sign from 0 to 9 are formed using kinect camera and we tested on 1236 images in the database on which training is applied and we achieved 98% training and an average accuracy for all the sign recognition as 83.5%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275608/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15487052","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275608/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sign language recognition through kinect based depth images and neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sign language recognition through kinect based depth images and neural network","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP0341570122145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046036S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7275610,"authors":[{"name":"Narotam Singh","affiliation":["India Meteorological Department, Information Communication and Instrumentation Training Center, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Narotam","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085608286"},{"name":"Amita Kapoor","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Delhi, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Amita","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"37085393056"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275610","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Convergence","Hopfield neural networks","Distortion","Oscillators","Biological neural networks","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud Hopfield neural network","modified retrieval algorithms","asynchronous retrieval algorithms","Hopfield dynamics","modified Hopfield neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud","Hopfield","artificial neural network","synchronous retrieval","asynchronous retrieval","machine learning","convergence time"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275610","abstract":"In this paper we present modifications in the dynamics of Hopfield neural network.

(DTCWT) domain based feature extraction method has been proposed to identify left and right hand motor imagery movements from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. After first performing auto-correlation of the EEG signals to enhance the weak brain signals and reduce noise, the EEG signals are decomposed into several bands of real and imaginary coefficients using DTCWT. The energy of the coefficients from relevant bands have been extracted as features and from the one way ANOVA analysis, scatter plots, box plots and histograms, this features are shown to be promising to distinguish various kinds of EEG signals. Publicly available benchmark BCI-competition 2003 Graz motor imagery dataset is used for this experiment. Among different types of classifiers developed such as support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), KNN classifiers have been shown to provide a good mean accuracy of 91.07% which is better than several existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275623","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","startPage":"290","endPage":"296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of motor imagery movements from EEG signals using Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identification of motor imagery movements from EEG signals using Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275623/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486965","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of motor imagery movements from EEG signals using Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP0491570136329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074012S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275629,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Service user (SU) and SP in cloud have potential conflicting interests: SUs prefers reliable resources at minimum cost for job execution whereas SPs prefers efficient utilization of resources with a maximum profit and optimal energy consumption. Hence it is necessary to have a resource bargaining mechanism that assures job execution and satisfies needs of SUs and SPs. This paper proposes a cooperation based resource bargaining scheme using game theoretic approach to manage cost, energy consumption and resource utilization. Bargaining process is applied through different strategies based on the status of SU and SP. The scheme is simulated to evaluate parameters like job submission, bargaining steps, expected payoffs, and job execution. We observed that the proposed scheme performs better than the non-cooperative version of proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275638","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275638.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-operation based game theoretic approach for resource bargaining in cloud computing environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275638/","displayDocTitle":"Co-operation based game theoretic approach for resource bargaining in cloud computing environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487091","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275638/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-operation based game theoretic approach for resource bargaining in cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP0641570133687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077736S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275655,"authors":[{"name":"Deeksha Anandani","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, VIT University Chennai, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Deeksha","lastName":"Anandani","id":"37085764791"},{"name":"Anurag Kumar","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, VIT University Chennai, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Anurag","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37088182415"},{"name":"V.

The most important module in designing communication system includes design of modulators. Different applications demand different types of modulators. Reconfigurable computing is considered as a state-of-the-art approach for system design, wherein the same hardware can reconfigure itself to perform different functionalities and is hence employed for various applications. Design and implementation of reconfigurable modulators on Virtex-5 FPGA is proposed in this paper, wherein the type of modulation can be dynamically reconfigured on-the-fly based on the requirement at any particular instance. The type of modulators that are used for reconfiguration in this work includes Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Phase Shift Keying (PSK), and Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK).

Thus, the challenge here is to achieve good performance without compromising the accuracy of the classifier. In order to achieve good performance pipelining and parallelism (key methodologies for improving the performance/frame rates) have been utilized in our architectures. We have used pairwise SVM classifier because of its greater accuracy and architectural simplicity. The architectures has been designed using fixed-point data format.

The most important module in designing communication system includes design of modulators and demodulators. Frequency modulation (FM) is widely used for various applications ranging from radio communication to on-board systems for aerospace and spacecraft applications. FM demodulators are used to demodulate the FM signals transmitted from such systems. In this paper, a novel attempt is made to use Goertzel algorithm for FM demodulation and its performance is compared with the system designed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Also a reusable Goertzel block based FM demodulator is proposed which reduces the hardware resources on increasing the number of frequencies to be detected. All the above mentioned systems are implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 board and their results are reported. 60-82% of hardware resources are saved on using proposed reusable Goertzel block based demodulator, which inturn saved the power consumption of the proposed design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and evaluation of FPGA based frequency demodulators","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275687","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275687.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of FPGA based frequency demodulators","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275687/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486871","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of FPGA based frequency demodulators","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP1131570130487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091504S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275757,"authors":[{"name":"Bhanu Panjwani","affiliation":["Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organization Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Bhanu","lastName":"Panjwani","id":"37085732539"},{"name":"Deval C.

This paper presents implementation of ECDSA on NIST recommended Elliptic curves in binary fields of size 163 bits. The work involved implementation of different modules of ECDSA on reconfigurable hardware platform (Xilinx xc6vlx240T-1ff1156). The private key generation and binary weight calculation (used in scalar multiplication) is done in software using Microblaze (soft core of Xilinx). The private key along with the other global parameters for ECDSA are passed from Microblaze to the programmable logic of FPGA where final signature generation and verification is performed. Two implementations have been done based on different word sizes in Montgomery multiplication over binary fields. The first implementation requires 0.367 ms with 11040 slices for signature generation and 0.393 ms with 12846 slices for signature verification at a clocking frequency of 100 MHz. The second implementation requires 0.615 ms with 8773 slices for signature generation and 0.672 ms with 9967 slices for signature verification at the same clocking frequency. These implementations are faster compared to other implementations reported in literature for binary curves.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-software co-design of elliptic curve digital signature algorithm over binary fields","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275757","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275757.pdf","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-software co-design of elliptic curve digital signature algorithm over binary fields","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275757/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487127","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-software co-design of elliptic curve digital signature algorithm over binary fields","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP1831570114891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04931S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275763,"authors":[{"name":"Vinayesh Sulochana","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Coventry university, UK"],"firstName":"Vinayesh","lastName":"Sulochana","id":"37085742689"},{"name":"Anish Francis","affiliation":["SENSE, Vellore Institute of Technology, KSEB"],"firstName":"Anish","lastName":"Francis","id":"38666698800"},{"name":"Andrew Tickle","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Coventry university, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Tickle","id":"37085748964"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275763","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275763","abstract":"Removed.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275763","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1143","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275763.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Removal: Morphology based radon processed neural network for transmission line fault detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275763/","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Removal: Morphology based radon processed neural network for transmission line fault detection","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15487152","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreNote":"Document Removed From IEEE Xplore: This document has been removed from IEEE Xplore in accordance with IEEE policy.

Bi-Directional Self-Organizing Neural Network (QBDSONN) for binary image denoising","abstract":"A Quantum Bi-directional Self-Organizing Neural Network (QBDSONN) architecture suitable for binary image denoising in real time is proposed in this article. It is composed of three second order neighborhood topology based interconnected layers of neurons (represented by qubits) known as input, intermediate and output layers. Moreover, it does not use any quantum back-propagation algorithm for the adjustment of its interconnection weights. Instead, it resorts to a counter-propagation of quantum states of the intermediate layer and the output layer. In the proposed architecture, the inter-connection weights and activation values are represented by rotation gates. The quantum neurons of each network layer follow a cellular network pattern and are fully intra-connected to each other. QBDSONN self-organizes the quantized input image information by means of the counter-propagating fashion of the quantum network states of the intermediate and output layers of the architecture. A quantum measurement at the output layer collapses superposition of quantum states of the processed information thereby yielding the desired outputs once the network attains stability. Applications of QBDSONN are demonstrated on the denoising of a synthetic and real life spanner image with different degrees of uniform noise and Gaussian noise. Comparative results indicate that QBDSONN outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of time and also it retains the shapes of the denoised images with great precision.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275780/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15487174","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275780/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Quantum Bi-Directional Self-Organizing Neural Network (QBDSONN) for binary image denoising","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quantum Bi-Directional Self-Organizing Neural Network (QBDSONN) for binary image denoising","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP2061570145433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090147S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275783,"authors":[{"name":"Soham Bhattacharjee","affiliation":["Electronics & Telecommunication Department Indian Institute of Engineering Science & Technology, Shibpur Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Soham","lastName":"Bhattacharjee","id":"37085728166"},{"name":"Saikat Kundu Choudhury","affiliation":["Electronics & Telecommunication Department Indian Institute of Engineering Science & Technology, Shibpur Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Saikat Kundu","lastName":"Choudhury","id":"37085731790"},{"name":"Shrayan Das","affiliation":["Electronics & Telecommunication Department Indian Institute of Engineering Science & Technology, Shibpur Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Shrayan","lastName":"Das","id":"37085722406"},{"name":"Ankita Pramanik","affiliation":["Electronics & Telecommunication Department Indian Institute of Engineering Science & Technology, Shibpur Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Ankita","lastName":"Pramanik","id":"37391220400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275783","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image reconstruction","Noise","Frequency-domain analysis","Filtering","Channel coding","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","compressed sensing","data compression","differential pulse code modulation","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DPCM block-based compressed sensing","frequency domain filtering","Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression","image reconstruction","smoothed projected landweber equations","noise removal","differential pulse coded modulation","channel coding technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","frequency domain filtering","Lempel-Ziv-Welch channel coding","Differential pulse code modulation"]}],"abstract":"Block Compressed Sensed (BCS) images reconstructed by the Smoothed Projected Landweber (SPL) equations are severely degraded in visual quality. This work focuses on removal of the noise present in the BCS - SPL reconstructed image. For noise removal the nature of the noise is studied first. A suitable frequency domain filter to mitigate this noise is proposed in this work. Differential Pulse Coded Modulation after coupling with Blocked Compress Sensing and the proposed filtering shows significant improvement in the result compared to many other similar techniques where generally smoothing filters or no filters are used. Along with Differential Pulse Coded Modulation, this work proposes the use of Lempel-Ziv-Welch channel coding technique for further compression of data. Significant compression is achieved for medical images compared to other channel coding techniques by the incorporation of LZW.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DPCM Block-based Compressed sensing with frequency domain filtering and Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275783","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275783.pdf","startPage":"1244","endPage":"1249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"DPCM Block-based Compressed sensing with frequency domain filtering and Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275783/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487030","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DPCM Block-based Compressed sensing with frequency domain filtering and Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP2091570152373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115836S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275813,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this paper, an investigation of different combined similarity metrics for extrinsic plagiarism detection is done and it focuses on unfolding the importance of combined similarity metrics over the commonly used single metric usage in plagiarism detection task. Further the impact of utilizing part of speech tagging (POS) in the plagiarism detection model is analyzed. Different combinations of the four single metrics, Cosine similarity, Dice coefficient, Match coefficient and Fuzzy-Semantic measure is used with and without POS tag information.

In this paper we proposed effective fragile video watermarking technique to embed and extract watermark in DCT domain with high capacity and transparency. Two watermarks are embedded into each frame. The first watermark is bits of the digital signature of hash value of the frame in frequency domain and second watermark is bits of micro-block numbers and frame numbers. The watermarks are embedded into video frames one by one in highest non-zero coefficient of quantized DCT coefficient. The first watermark is used to detect tampering and second watermark is used to localize the area being tampered. This technique causes significantly smaller video distortion as bits are embedded into the highest frequency coefficients. The embedded watermark is extracted and verified using public key. The block numbers and frame numbers are inserted in order to detect intra-frame and inter-frame tampering such as addition or removal of content within frames, frame reordering, dropping or addition of extra frames. If the video is being tampered we may extract one watermark correctly but other may get destroyed. As a result tamper detection of watermarked digital video will proved to be more authentic.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275852","startPage":"1661","endPage":"1666","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275852.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fragile video watermarking for tampering detection and localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fragile video watermarking for tampering detection and localization","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275852/","accessionNumber":"15486976","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275852/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fragile video watermarking for tampering detection and localization","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP2781570115859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04451S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275869,"authors":[{"name":"Anunchitha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Vedavyasa Institute of Technology, Kerala, India"],"lastName":"Anunchitha","id":"37085618021"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275869","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Energy efficiency","Array signal processing","OFDM","Information rates","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","demodulation","energy conservation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","radio transceivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM DF relay channel","modulation scheme","energy efficiency","cooperative communication","spectrum efficiency enhancement","transmit cooperative beamforming scenario","multiple-input-multiple-output system","decode-and-forward relay channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique","OFDM modulator","OFDM demodulator","transceiver performance","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Decode-and-forward","Energy efficiency","MIMO","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative communication has attracted foremost research concern due to its ability to expand system coverage and enhance spectrum efficiency. In this paper, a transmit cooperative beamforming scenario with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) decode-and-forward (DF) relay channel with a direct source to destination link is considered, into which an orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) technique is incorporated by including an OFDM modulator/demodulator in the transceiver. Results show the performance comparison based on achievable information rate for the transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for different modulation scheme and it is seen that with OFDM the overall performance of the system is enhanced further. Results also show the comparison of energy efficiency of the transmitter in MIMO-OFDM DF relay and MIMO DF relay channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275869","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275869.pdf","startPage":"1762","endPage":"1765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realizing cooperative beamforming scenario with MIMO-OFDM DF relay channels and performance comparison based on modulation scheme and energy efficiency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275869/","displayDocTitle":"Realizing cooperative beamforming scenario with MIMO-OFDM DF relay channels and performance comparison based on modulation scheme and energy efficiency","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486912","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275869/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realizing cooperative beamforming scenario with MIMO-OFDM DF relay channels and performance comparison based on modulation scheme and energy efficiency","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP2951570122857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045483S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275871,"authors":[{"name":"Vinod Gutta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Vinod","lastName":"Gutta","id":"37085632294"},{"name":"Kamal Kanth Toguru Anand","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"Kamal Kanth Toguru","lastName":"Anand"},{"name":"Teja Sri Venkata Saidhar Movva","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"Teja Sri Venkata Saidhar","lastName":"Movva"},{"name":"Bhargava Rama Korivi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Bhargava Rama","lastName":"Korivi","id":"37085626965"},{"name":"Santosh Killamsetty","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Santosh","lastName":"Killamsetty","id":"37085623319"},{"name":"Sudheesh Padmanabhan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Sudheesh","lastName":"Padmanabhan","id":"38242589200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275871","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Kalman filters","Estimation","OFDM","Mathematical model","Time-domain analysis","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fuzzy logic","Kalman filters","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity channel estimation","fuzzy Kalman filter","fast time varying MIMO-OFDM systems","channel impulse response estimation","time varying velocity","second order auto regressive random model","fuzzy logic"]}],"abstract":"Estimation of channel is a significant issue in wireless communication.

To start communication in CRNs, users need to establish a link on a channel which in not occupied by licensed user. Rendezvous is an essential operation in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) to establish a link on common channel for data communication and control information exchange. To achieve guaranteed rendezvous in finite time, most of the proposed algorithms generate channel hopping (CH) sequence using all channels regardless of their availability. Thus, the CH sequence without considering channel availability information may attempt to achieve rendezvous on unavailable channels that result longer time to rendezvous (TTR). The implementation of rendezvous processes in order to minimize the TTR is a major challenge in CRNs. Most of the reported schemes on rendezvous are based on central controller or utilize common control channel this may not be always possible in CRNs. In this paper, we consider the blind rendezvous problem, which find common channel without any central controller. We propose a guaranteed, distributed rendezvous algorithm which finds a commonly available channel for two users called as Periodic Channel Hopping (PCH) sequence algorithm. Our PCH scheme considers only the channels those are free from licensed users. The maximum time to rendezvous (MTTR) and expected time to rendezvous (ETTR) of our PCH scheme are reduced to (2M - 1) and (M - 1) respectively in symmetric model that is better as compared to other competitive schemes. In an asymmetric case, the proposed scheme guarantees rendezvous and MTTR is bounded by M(2M - 1).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275874/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15487157","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275874/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Periodic channel-hopping sequence for rendezvous in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic channel-hopping sequence for rendezvous in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3001570132659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100212S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275904,"authors":[{"name":"Nitul Dutta","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, MEF Group of Institutions, Rajkot, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Nitul","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37410076600"},{"name":"Hiren Kumar Deva Sarma","affiliation":["Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Gangtok, Sikkim, IN"],"firstName":"Hiren Kumar Deva","lastName":"Sarma"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275904","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Optimization","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Linear programming","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","minimisation","radio spectrum management","stochastic processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","CRN","spectrum hole optimum utilization","packet generation control","cognitive user","CU","Poisson process","optimization function","spectrum hole compression","spectrum hole expansion","channel utilization maximization","packet loss minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Networks","Optimization","Poisson's Distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275904","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275904","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","abstract":"This paper provides an analysis of the Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) for optimized utilization of spectrum hole.

We emphasize on determining the volume of data to be generated by CUs based on the available spectrum hole in order to achieve minimum packet loss and maximum throughput. For analytical evaluation, the packet arrival at CU is modeled as Poisson's process and availability of channels for CU devices are modeled as random activity. An optimization function is designed to provide a feed back to CR devices for controlling the packet generation depending on the expansion and compression of spectrum hole over time. An algorithm is also proposed to increase or decrease packet generation in order to maximize channel utilization and minimize packet loss. Various costs computed through numerical evaluation show that the cost of CRN system could significantly be improved by adjusting packet generation based on size of the spectrum hole.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","startPage":"1952","endPage":"1959","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275904.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical study of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs): An exploration for optimum utilization of spectrum hole","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275904/","displayDocTitle":"Analytical study of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs): An exploration for optimum utilization of spectrum hole","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487135","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical study of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs): An exploration for optimum utilization of spectrum hole","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3301570122019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09277S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275905,"authors":[{"name":"Nitul Dutta","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, MEF Group of Institutions, Raikot, India"],"firstName":"Nitul","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37410076600"},{"name":"Hiren Kumar Deva Sarma","affiliation":["Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Gangtok, Sikkim, IN"],"firstName":"Hiren Kumar Deva","lastName":"Sarma"},{"name":"Ashish Kr.

There are many routing algorithms proposed for CRNs so far. Most of these algorithms discover single path from source to destination and consume considerable amount of bandwidth during route discovery. On the other hand, the multipath algorithms designed for AdHoc networks show significant improvements in bandwidth utilization by discovering multiple paths using one route discovery process. So, it is believed that such multipath routing algorithm provides substantially resilient behavior to the channel dynamism because multiple paths are discovered within single round of path discovery. In this paper, a multipath routing protocol for Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is proposed. The protocol considers channel stability for route formation and finds multiple disjoint paths between two nodes. The proposed multipath protocol is compared with Cognitive AODV (CAODV). Result shows that the performance of the proposed protocol is better in terms of packet loss rate, route discovery latency, route discovery frequency, and average delay.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275905","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275905.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275905","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","startPage":"1960","endPage":"1965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multipath routing protocol for Cognitive Radio AdHoc Networks (CRAHNs)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A multipath routing protocol for Cognitive Radio AdHoc Networks (CRAHNs)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275905/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275905/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486986","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multipath routing protocol for Cognitive Radio AdHoc Networks (CRAHNs)","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3311570127385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069929S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275906,"authors":[{"name":"Ram Prakash Sharma","affiliation":["University of Hyderabad, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Ram Prakash","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085706837"},{"name":"Rajarshi Pal","affiliation":["Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Rajarshi","lastName":"Pal","id":"37409002000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275906","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Visualization","Genetic algorithms","Distortion","Sociology","Statistics","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image coding","steganography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saliency based image steganography","SDS","multiobjective genetic algorithm","secret message hiding","visual degradation","embedding capacity","visual saliency","multiobjective optimization problem","single digit sum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image steganography","Visual saliency","Genetic algorithm","Single digit sum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275906","abstract":"Hiding secret message into images is known as image steganography.

Simulation results show that FTVD with an optimum value for regularization parameter enables extraction of the watermark image in visually recognizable form, while Wiener deconvolution neither restores the watermarked image nor the watermark when no knowledge of noise is used.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275910","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275910.pdf","startPage":"1994","endPage":"2000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image watermarking on degraded compressed sensing measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275910/","displayDocTitle":"Image watermarking on degraded compressed sensing measurements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487195","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275910/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image watermarking on degraded compressed sensing measurements","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3361570136771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08072S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275938,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Guangyi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277947300"},{"name":"Sridhar Krishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Sridhar","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37275777100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275938","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Endoscopes","Image classification","Pattern recognition","Tumors","Image color analysis","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feature selection","image classification","image texture","medical image processing","statistical analysis","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bowel image classification","dual tree complex wavelet transform","DTCWT","cross cooccurrence texture feature","canonical discriminant analysis","minimum redundancy maximum relevance","mRMR algorithm","medical imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image classification","pattern recognition","cross co-occurrence matrix","small bowel image classification","medical image analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a modified algorithm is proposed for automatically classifying small bowel images into normal or abnormal class. Instead of the shift-invariant overcomplete wavelet transform, our modification performs the dual tree complex transform (DTCWT) to the small bowel images for three-decomposition scales and clamp and linearly scale the DTCWT subbands. As the original algorithm, we extracts cross co-occurrence matrix from each DTCWT subband, and calculate four textural features from each cross co-occurrence matrix. Unlike the original algorithm, we select a subset of the calculated texture features by means of minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. We use canonical discriminant analysis as a classifier in order to classify a small bowel image into normal or abnormal class, just like the original algorithm. Experimental results show that our proposed modification outperforms the original algorithm for small bowel image classification by 5.3% in terms of correct classification rate for the same dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275938","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275938.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","startPage":"2174","endPage":"2179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small bowel image classification using dual tree complex wavelet-based cross co-occurrence features and canonical discriminant analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Small bowel image classification using dual tree complex wavelet-based cross co-occurrence features and canonical discriminant analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275938/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487150","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7275938/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small bowel image classification using dual tree complex wavelet-based cross co-occurrence features and canonical discriminant analysis","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3641570079557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080703S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275943,"authors":[{"name":"Nooby Mariam","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication Engineering, University of Calicut, Thrikkanappuram"],"firstName":"Nooby","lastName":"Mariam","id":"37085660157"},{"name":"Rejiram R","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication Engineering, University of Calicut, Thrikkanappuram"],"lastName":"Rejiram R","id":"37085658419"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275943","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","discrete wavelet transforms","edge detection","feature extraction","image colour analysis","image representation","image retrieval","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CBIR","content based image retrieval systems","image representation","edge detection","discrete wavelet transform","image color","image texture","image shape","intensity variation","feature vectors generation","YCbCr color spaces","HSI color spaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["YCbCr","HSI","RGB","Canny Edge Detection","prewitt edge detection","Color Edge Detection","Wavelet Transform","Haar","Precision","Recall"]}],"abstract":"Content based image retrieval systems use the contents of the images to represent and access the images. Content basically refers to the image descriptors like color, texture and shape of the image. Among the different image features, edges are the important one as edges represent mainly the local intensity variations.

This paper describes a new method in which both edge and color features of the images are considered for generation of feature vectors. Discrete Wavelet Transform is used to preserve the detailed contents of the images along with the reduction of the size of the feature vector.

Computer-aided sleep staging can alleviate the onus of the sleep scorers. Again, most of the existing works on automatic sleep staging are multichannel based. Multichannel based sleep scoring is not pragmatic for the implementation of a wearable and portable sleep quality evaluation device. Due to all these factors, automatic sleep scoring based on single channel EEG is garnering increasing attention of sleep researchers. In this work, we propound a single channel based solution to sleep scoring. First, we decompose the EEG signals into segments. We then compute various statistical and spectral features from the signal segments. After performing statistical analyses, we perform classification using artificial neural network. Results of various experiments perspicuously manifest that the proposed scheme is superior to state-of-the-art ones in accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275950","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275950.pdf","startPage":"2238","endPage":"2243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the classification of sleep states by means of statistical and spectral features from single channel Electroencephalogram","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275950/","displayDocTitle":"On the classification of sleep states by means of statistical and spectral features from single channel Electroencephalogram","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487218","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275950/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the classification of sleep states by means of statistical and spectral features from single channel Electroencephalogram","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3761570138357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.188804S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275964,"authors":[{"name":"Sheikh Rafiul Islam","affiliation":["Neotia Institute of Technology Management and Science, Jhinga, WB, INDIA"],"firstName":"Sheikh Rafiul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37085712620"},{"name":"Santi P.

This is essential in many practical imaging system as sampling at Nyquist rate may not always be possible due to limited storage facility, slow sampling rate or the measurements are extremely expensive e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mathematically, CS addresses the problem for finding out the root of an unknown distribution comprises of unknown as well as known observations. Robbins-Monro (RM) stochastic approximation, a non-parametric approach, is explored here as a solution to CS reconstruction problem. A distance based linear prediction using the observed measurements is done to obtain the unobserved samples followed by random noise addition to act as residual (prediction error). A spatial domain adaptive Wiener filter is then used to diminish the noise and to reveal the new features from the degraded observations. Extensive simulation results highlight the relative performance gain over the existing work.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275964","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275964.pdf","startPage":"2317","endPage":"2323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On compressed sensing image reconstruction using linear prediction in adaptive filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7275964/","displayDocTitle":"On compressed sensing image reconstruction using linear prediction in adaptive filtering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15486910","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7275964/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On compressed sensing image reconstruction using linear prediction in adaptive filtering","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3901570134005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092638S","chronDate":"10-13 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259950","isNumber":"7275573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259950","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7275573","articleId":"7275964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7275980,"authors":[{"name":"Archana G P","affiliation":["Virtual Resource Center for Language Computing, Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala"],"lastName":"Archana G P","id":"37085615454"},{"name":"Jithesh V S","affiliation":["Virtual Resource Center for Language Computing, Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala"],"lastName":"Jithesh V S","id":"37085625791"},{"name":"Remya L B","affiliation":["Virtual Resource Center for Language Computing, Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala"],"lastName":"Remya L B","id":"37085617723"},{"name":"Elizabeth Sherly","affiliation":["Virtual Resource Center for Language Computing, Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala"],"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Sherly","id":"37393049400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8792-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8790-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8791-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7275980","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Syntactics","Context","Buildings","Information technology","Informatics","Semantics","Agriculture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","language translation","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel corpora","translation issue","remedial case","multilingual country","language translation","text processing","machine learning","machine translation","information extraction","information retrieval","natural language understanding system","lexical divergence","ambiguity","lexical mismatch","syntactic issue","semantic issue","comparative analysis","Hindi language","Malayalam language","Indian language corpora initiative","ILCI project"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel corpus","translation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7275980","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259950/7275573/07275980.pdf","startPage":"2414","endPage":"2417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275980","doi":"10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7275573","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building a parallel Corpora: Translation issues and remedial case","abstract":"In a multilingual country like India, language translation plays a prominent role in the field of text processing and applications, such as, machine learning, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval, and natural language understanding systems.

This tutorial aims to present new different approaches, specially focused on Genetic Algorithms, which can deal with these problems.","doi":"10.1109/INISTA.2015.7276718","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269504/7276713/07276718.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Innovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Innovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INISTA.2015.7276718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7276713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tutorial on manifold clustering using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7276718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A tutorial on manifold clustering using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15487398","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7276718/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tutorial on manifold clustering using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"PID3791397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089103S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7269504","isNumber":"7276713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269504","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7276713","articleId":"7276718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7276725,"authors":[{"name":"Sinem Bozkurt","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering"],"firstName":"Sinem","lastName":"Bozkurt","id":"38469410000"},{"name":"Gulin Elibol","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkiye"],"firstName":"Gulin","lastName":"Elibol","id":"37085677171"},{"name":"Serkan Gunal","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkiye"],"firstName":"Serkan","lastName":"Gunal","id":"37938751100"},{"name":"Ugur Yayan","affiliation":["R&D Department, Inovasyon Muhendislik Ltd.

In this method, initially a radio map is created using Received Signal Strength (RSS) values that are measured from predefined reference points. During the positioning, the best match between the observed RSS values and existing RSS values in the radio map is established as the predicted position. In the positioning literature, machine learning algorithms have widespread usage in estimating positions. One of the main problems in indoor positioning systems is to find out appropriate machine learning algorithm. In this paper, selected machine learning algorithms are compared in terms of positioning accuracy and computation time. In the experiments, UJIIndoorLoc indoor positioning database is used. Experimental results reveal that k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is the most suitable one during the positioning. Additionally, ensemble algorithms such as AdaBoost and Bagging are applied to improve the decision tree classifier performance nearly same as k-NN that is resulted as the best classifier for indoor positioning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7276725/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15487396","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7276725/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study on machine learning algorithms for indoor positioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study on machine learning algorithms for indoor positioning","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"1570156471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122575S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7269504","isNumber":"7276713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269504","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7276713","articleId":"7276725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":7276732,"authors":[{"name":"Kemal Keskin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kemal","lastName":"Keskin","id":"38469445100"},{"name":"Abdurrahman Karamancioglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Abdurrahman","lastName":"Karamancioglu","id":"38254857000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7751-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9096-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7276732","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Energy consumption","Mathematical model","Simulated annealing","Switches","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","genetic algorithms","railways"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid optimization algorithm","energy efficient train operation","energy consumption","genetic algorithm","simulated annealing","performance verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-efficient train operation","genetic algorithm","simulated annealing","hybrid algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this manuscript, an energy-efficient train operation between successive stations is studied.

It is shown that, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, when employed in a hybrid algorithm, complement each other in finding such switching points. For a performance verification of the hybrid optimization approach, multiple test tracks with different lengths are considered. Also certain real life constraints are taken into account such as punctuality and maximum speed limit. Obtained results are compared to the single genetic algorithm and it is shown that the hybrid algorithm built as a cascade combination of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing can reach optimum solution with better accuracy and lower time consumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid optimization algorithm for energy efficient train operation","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Innovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","doi":"10.1109/INISTA.2015.7276732","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Innovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269504/7276713/07276732.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INISTA.2015.7276732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7276713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7276732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7276732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid optimization algorithm for energy efficient train operation","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7276732/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487417","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid optimization algorithm for energy efficient train operation","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"1570147327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098211S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7269504","isNumber":"7276713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269504","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7276713","articleId":"7276732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7276743,"authors":[{"name":"Mert Alper Duran","affiliation":["Electric and Electronic Engineering, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mert Alper","lastName":"Duran","id":"37085675595"},{"name":"\u00dcmm\u00fchan Ba\u015faran Filik","affiliation":["Electric and Electronic Engineering, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00dcmm\u00fchan Ba\u015faran","lastName":"Filik","id":"37293871500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7751-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9096-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7276743","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7276743","abstract":"Due to the negative environmental impact of using fossil energy sources and depletion of fossil fuels, the alternative energy sources are being searched all over the world.

In terms of the reliability and power quality of the power system, the variability of wind energy has led to problems. To minimize these problems, highly accurate wind speed prediction method should be used. In this study, accurate short term wind speed prediction approach is aimed for increasing efficiency of wind energy production. The short term wind speed prediction approached is trained/tested with real three years hourly averaged wind speed values from Eskisehir region of Turkey.

The presence of this new element brings advantages over the state of the art in terms of both spectral efficiency and energy consumption. In particular, it provides the means of performing both an arbitrary attenuation of the incoming signal, which in turn increases the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art self-interference cancellation strategies subsequently adopted in the RX chain, and the recycling of a non-negligible portion of the energy leaked through the nonideal circulator. The performance of this architecture is analyzed in a practically relevant four-node scenario in which two nodes operate in FD and two nodes in half-duplex (HD). Analytical approximations are derived for both the achievable rates of the transmissions performed by the FD and HD radios and the energy recycled by the FD radios. The accuracy of these derivations is confirmed by numerical simulations. Quantitatively, achievable rate gains up to 40% over the state-of-the-art alternatives, in the considered scenario, are highlighted. Furthermore, up to 50% of the leaked energy at the circulator, i.e., 5% of the energy of the transmitted signal, can be recycled.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7276978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15602329","htmlLink":"/document/7276978/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-recycling full-duplex radios for next-generation networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"A*STAR SERC","grantNumber":"1224104048"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004835","fundingName":"SUTD-ZJU Research Collaboration","grantNumber":"SUTD-ZJU/RES/01/2014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"MOE ARF Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST104-2221-E-001-013-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-recycling full-duplex radios for next-generation networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-maso-2482058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135721S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7276978","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7276979,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Telecommunications, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7276979/lchen-2482098-small.gif","p":["Lijun Chen (M\u201905) received the Ph.D. degree in control and dynamical systems from California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 2007.

An important question is how speed scaling interacts with other resource allocation mechanisms such as scheduling and routing. In this paper, we study the interaction of speed scaling with load balancing. We characterize the equilibrium resulting from the load balancing and speed scaling interaction, and introduce two optimal load-balancing designs, in terms of traditional performance metric and cost-aware (in particular, energy-aware) performance metric, respectively. Especially, we characterize the load-balancing-speed-scaling equilibrium with respect to the optimal load-balancing schemes in processor-sharing systems. Our results show that the degree of inefficiency at the equilibrium is mostly bounded by the heterogeneity of the system, but independent of the number of servers. These results provide insights in understanding the interaction of load balancing with speed scaling and guiding new designs.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2482098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07276979.pdf","startPage":"2567","endPage":"2578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2482098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Interaction Between Load Balancing and Speed Scaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7276979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7276979/","displayDocTitle":"On the Interaction Between Load Balancing and Speed Scaling","volume":"33","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602327","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7276979/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"INFORMS Annual Meeting"},{"fundingName":"ITA Workshop"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Interaction Between Load Balancing and Speed Scaling","sourcePdf":"jsac-chen-2482098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173477S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7276979","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7276986,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Fu","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7404297/7276986/weifu-2477364-small.gif","p":["Wei Fu (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2012.

The proposed method adaptively explores the spatial information and incorporates it into a joint sparse representation classifier. First, the HSI is transformed with the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm. Then, the first principal component (PC), which represents the most spatial variation in the HSI, is used in the shape-adaptive algorithm to construct a shape-adaptive local smooth region for each test pixel. Unlike the fixed-sized window used in other sparse representation-based methods, the shape-adaptive regions have adaptive sizes and shapes, and conform to the spatial structure of the HSI as far as possible. Finally, the label of the test pixel is determined by applying the joint sparse representation classifier to the first several PCs of pixels within the corresponding SA region. According to the experiments performed on several HSIs, the proposed SAJSRC method outperforms some widely used HSIs classification approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7276986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7276986/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15775354","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Via Shape-Adaptive Joint Sparse Representation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172161"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61325007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003824","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Via Shape-Adaptive Joint Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"jstars-li-2477364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12724S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7404297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7404297","articleId":"7276986","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7276992,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Ghelfi","affiliation":["National Interuniversity Consortium for Telecommunications\u2014National Laboratory of Photonic Networks, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Paolo Ghelfi received the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from\n University of Parma, Parma, Italy, in 2000.

In particular, photonics is enabling a new generation of the multiband radars able to manage multiple coherent radar signals at different frequencies simultaneously, with high and frequency-independent quality, enabling multispectral imaging for advanced surveillance systems. In fact, thanks to its high stability and huge bandwidth, photonics matches the urgent requirements of the performance and flexibility of the next-generation software-defined radar architectures, and it guarantees system compactness, thanks to the use of a single shared transceiver for multiband operations and to the potentials for photonic integration, which also promises reduced power consumption. In this paper, we present the first field trial, in a maritime scenario, of a fully coherent multiband radar enabled by the use of photonics. The paper reviews the basic concepts exploited for the photonic generation and the detection of the radar signals, and describes the extension to the multiband operation. We present details on the implementation and testing of a dual-band coherent radar system, discussing the potentials for a software-defined radio approach. Moreover, the results obtained after a simple digital data fusion are discussed, highlighting the capability of the coherent photonics-based multiband radars in exploiting the extended observation bandwidth for improving the system detection resolution with minimum computational costs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7405362/07276992.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"507","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2482390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2482390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7276992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonics for Radars Operating on Multiple Coherent Bands","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonics","Radar","Radio frequency","Optical filters","RF signals","Optical transmitters","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave photonics","radar signal processing","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave photonics","multiple coherent bands","maritime scenario","photonic generation","radar signal detection","software-defined radio approach","digital data fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler radar","microwave photonics","multiband radar","radar equipment","radar signal processing"]},{"kwd":["Doppler radar","microwave photonics","multiband radar","radar equipment","radar signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7276992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Photonics for Radars Operating on Multiple Coherent Bands","volume":"34","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7276992/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15786104","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonics for Radars Operating on Multiple Coherent Bands","sourcePdf":"jlt-ghelfi-2482390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108933S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7405362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7405362","articleId":"7276992","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7276996,"authors":[{"name":"Ce Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and the Center for Robotics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7423828/7276996/zhu-2475697-small.gif","p":["Ce Zhu (M\u201903\u2013SM\u201904) received the B.S. degree from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 1989, and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1992 and 1994, respectively, all in electronic and information engineering.","He was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, in 1995, the City University of Hong Kong, and the University of Melbourne, Australia, from 1996 to 1998.

An inherent problem in the DIBR view synthesis is occurrence of holes in a synthesized image, which is also known as disocclusion problem. The disoccluded regions need to be handled properly in order to generate a synthesized view of good quality. This paper provides a fundamental examination of hole generation mechanism in the DIBR oriented view synthesis process. A necessary and sufficient condition of hole generation is first shown, and the corresponding hole location and length is obtained analytically. Furthermore, in view that the conventional hole filling algorithms may fail to fill up a hole correctly when lacking (adequate) visible background information, we propose utilizing the occluded (invisible) information to identify and locate the relevant background pixels around a hole. We then make use of the visible and invisible background information together to perform hole filling. Experimental results validate our hole generation model demonstrating agreement to our analytical results, while our proposed hole filling approach shows superior performance in terms of visual quality of synthesized views.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2475697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7423828/07276996.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2475697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7423828","startPage":"82","endPage":"93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth Image Based View Synthesis: New Insights and Perspectives on Hole Generation and Filling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7276996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Depth Image Based View Synthesis: New Insights and Perspectives on Hole Generation and Filling","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7276996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15835625","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7276996/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA015903"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2014Z003"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20130182110010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth Image Based View Synthesis: New Insights and Perspectives on Hole Generation and Filling","sourcePdf":"tbc-zhu-2475697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075014S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7423828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7423828","articleId":"7276996","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7277000,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng-Yu Huang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng-Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085509101"},{"name":"Li-Hua Shi","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Li-Hua","lastName":"Shi","id":"37271159700"},{"name":"Qing Si","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Si","id":"37085627324"},{"name":"Bin Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085447319"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7277000","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Electric fields","Current density","Transient analysis","Magnetic domains","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unconditionally stable associated hermite FDTD method","plane wave incidence","plane wave excitation formulation","electromagnetic propagation","expansion coefficient evaluation","incident field","AH transformation matrix","Maxwell equation","volume magnetic current density","volume electric current density","plane wave injector","unconditionally stable AH finite-difference time-domain method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Associated Hermite functions","finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","plane wave excitation","unconditionally stable"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we developed a plane wave excitation formulation for the unconditionally stable Associated Hermite (AH) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.

The results of bioinformatics analysis show that these DEGs play important roles in the development of cervical cancer. Through comparing two differential co-expression networks (DCNs) at two different states, we found a common sub-network and two differential sub-networks as well as some hub genes in three sub-networks. Moreover, some of the hub genes have been reported to be related to the cervical cancer. Those hub genes were analyzed from Gene Ontology function enrichment, pathway enrichment and protein binding three aspects.

The proposed model, called the generalized-susceptible exposed infected vigilant, subsumes a large number of popular epidemic models considered in the literature as special cases. Using a mean-field approximation, we derive a set of ODEs describing the spreading dynamics, provide a careful analysis of the disease-free equilibrium, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for global exponential stability. Building on this analysis, we consider the problem of containing an initial epidemic outbreak under budget constraints. More specifically, we consider a collection of control actions (e.g., administering vaccines/antidotes, limiting the traffic between cities, or running awareness campaigns), for which we are given suitable cost functions. In this context, we develop an optimization framework to provide solutions for the following two allocation problems: 1) find the minimum cost required to eradicate the disease at a desired exponential decay rate, and 2) given a fixed budget, find the resource allocation to eradicate the disease at the fastest possible exponential decay rate. Our technical approach relies on the reformulation of these problems as geometric programs that can be solved efficiently in polynomial time using tools from graph theory and convex optimization. In contrast with previous works, our optimization framework allows us to simultaneously allocate different types of control resources over heterogeneous populations under budget constraints. We illustrate our results through numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCNS.2015.2482221","pdfPath":"/iel7/6509490/7951056/07277005.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"169","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCNS.2015.2482221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Control of Networked Epidemic Models","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6509490/7951056/7277005-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Control of Networked Epidemic Models","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16970132","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7277005/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1302222 and IIS-1447470"},{"fundingName":"TerraSwarm, one of six centers of STARnet, a Semiconductor Research Corporation program sponsored by MARCO and DARPA."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Optimal Resource Allocation for Control of Networked Epidemic Models","sourcePdf":"tcns-nowzari-2482221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095853S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6509490","isNumber":"7951056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7951056","articleId":"7277005","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7277010,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Feng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Feng","id":"37405917600"},{"name":"Xin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085425018"},{"name":"Wenquan Che","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenquan","lastName":"Che","id":"37284442800"},{"name":"Wanchen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wanchen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37071058900"},{"name":"Quan Xue","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Xue","id":"37280402500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7277010","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1147},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277010","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonator filters","Band-pass filters","Filtering theory","Passband","Resonant frequency","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","microwave filters","poles and zeros"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high selectivity wideband balanced filters","multiple transmission zeros","open-shorted stubs","passband filters","differential mode","bandwidth 7.0 GHz to 12.7 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Balanced filter","bandwidth","differential mode (DM)/common mode (CM)","open/shorted stubs","transmission zeros"]}],"abstract":"Two novel high selectivity wideband balanced filters based on open/shorted stubs with multiple transmission zeros are proposed in this brief.

The direct conversion transmitters are widely used in wireless systems. However, the unwanted image-frequencies and distortions are inevitably introduced into the direct conversion system. This problem is even severer in wideband systems. Therefore, the accurate estimation and compensation of I/Q imbalance is crucial. The current compensation method is based on external instruments or internal feedback path which introduces additional impairments and is expensive. This paper proposes a low cost FD I/Q imbalance self-IQ-demodulation based compensation scheme without using external calibration instruments. First, the impairments of baseband and RF components are investigated. Further, I/Q imbalance model is developed. Then, the proposed two-step self-IQ-demodulation based compensation scheme is investigated. In the first step of the scheme, the local oscillator (LO) related I/Q impairments parameters are estimated. Then in the second step, the overall FD I/Q imbalance parameters are estimated by utilizing the transmitter LO. To realize this self-IQ-demodulation algorithm, this paper introduces minor modifications to the current power detector circuit. Afterwards, the estimated parameters are applied to the baseband equivalent compensator. This sophisticated algorithm guarantees low computation complexity and low cost. The compensation performance is evaluated in laboratory measurement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277012/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15660696","volume":"61","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Self-IQ-Demodulation Based Compensation Scheme of Frequency-Dependent IQ Imbalance for Wideband Direct-Conversion Transmitters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-IQ-Demodulation Based Compensation Scheme of Frequency-Dependent IQ Imbalance for Wideband Direct-Conversion Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tbc-zhang-2465138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071101S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7337347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7337347","articleId":"7277012","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7277020,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew P.

The channel estimation process is divided into two main phases. The relay-destination channel is estimated in the first phase and can be obtained using well-known point-to-point MIMO OFDM estimation methods. In the second phase, the source-relay channel is estimated at the destination with the use of a known training sequence that is transmitted from the source and forwarded to the destination by a nonregenerative relay. To obtain an estimate of the source-relay channel, the source training sequence, relay precoder, and destination processor, require to be optimized. To solve this problem, we first derive an iterative algorithm that involves sequentially solving a number of convex optimization problems to update the source, relay, and destination design variables. Since the iterative algorithm may be too computationally expensive for practical implementation, we then derive simplified solutions that have reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07277020.pdf","startPage":"4711","endPage":"4726","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2481897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2481897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training-Based Channel Estimation Algorithms for Dual Hop MIMO OFDM Relay Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Relays","Training","OFDM","MIMO","Estimation","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","convex programming","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation algorithms","multiple-input multiple-output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing relaying systems","dual hop MIMO OFDM relay systems","minimum mean square error","MMSE","relay-destination channel","point-to-point MIMO OFDM estimation methods","source-relay channel","nonregenerative relay","relay precoder","convex optimization problems","iterative algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO OFDM","relay networks","MMSE channel estimation","training sequences design"]},{"kwd":["MIMO OFDM","relay networks","MMSE channel estimation","training sequences design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Training-Based Channel Estimation Algorithms for Dual Hop MIMO OFDM Relay Systems","volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7277020/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677217","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Training-Based Channel Estimation Algorithms for Dual Hop MIMO OFDM Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-weiss-2481897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111742S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7277020","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7277029,"authors":[{"name":"Arman Shojaeifard","affiliation":["Microwave and Communication Systems Group, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Arman Shojaeifard (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913) received the B.Eng. degree in Information Systems Engineering (ISE) from Imperial College London, U.K., in August 2008.

The analysis leverages on a moment-generating-function (MGF) methodology, which only requires the statistics of intended signal and aggregate interference, thus eliminating the need for the exact distribution of SINR. We extend the existing results on interference statistics by deriving a generalized closed-form expression of the interference MGF considering Nakagami-m fading channels with exclusion region. In certain special cases, explicit expressions for the averages of different functions of SINR are found, which also lead to closed-form solutions for the probability distributions of aggregate interference reciprocal and signal-to-interference ratio. We prove that in such cases the effect of total PPP-based interference power on useful transmission is mathematically equivalent to the severe fluctuations from a one-sided Gaussian fading channel. As an application example, the proposed methodology is used together with stochastic geometry theory to characterize the average SINR and rate in heterogeneous cellular networks. The validity of our analytical derivations is confirmed via Monte Carlo simulations for various system settings. We show that with cellular network densification there exists a tradeoff between the average SINR and rate performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact SINR Statistics in the Presence of Heterogeneous Interferers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2482482","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7331248/07277029.pdf","startPage":"6759","endPage":"6773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2482482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Exact SINR Statistics in the Presence of Heterogeneous Interferers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7277029/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601925","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/J021768/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Exact SINR Statistics in the Presence of Heterogeneous Interferers","sourcePdf":"tit-shojaeifard-2482482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121102S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7331248","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7331248","articleId":"7277029","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7277031,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9my Guy","affiliation":["Commisariat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9nergie Atomique\u2013Laboratoire d\u2019\u00c9lectronique et de Technologie de l\u2019Information, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7302109/7277031/guy-2476825-small.gif","p":["J\u00e9r\u00e9my Guy received the Engineering degree in material science from the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon (INSA), Lyon, France, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in microelectronic and embedded system from INSA, and the University of Lyon, Lyon, in 2012.

Based on inputs from ab initio calculations and the physical properties of the materials, the model offers the simulation of both the Forming/SET and the Data Retention operations. It aims to create a bond between the physics at atomic level and the device behavior. From the model and experimental results obtained on decananometric devices, we propose an understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in the CBRAM operations. Using the consistent Forming/SET and Data Retention model, we obtained good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the impact of each layer of the CBRAM on the Forming/SET behavior is decorrelated, allowing an optimization of the performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Switches","Electrodes","Energy states","Voltage measurement","Data models","Oxidation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SET","data retention","conductive-bridge random-access memory","stack optimization","CBRAM","ionic hopping","chemical reaction dynamic","ab initio calculation","depth forming","decananometric device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conductive-bridge random-access memory (CBRAM)","Data Retention","Forming","kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) modeling","resistive memory","resistive RAM","SET","transition-state theory (TST)."]},{"kwd":["Conductive-bridge random-access memory (CBRAM)","Data Retention","Forming","kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) modeling","resistive memory","resistive RAM","SET","transition-state theory (TST)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277031","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2476825","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7302109/07277031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2476825","startPage":"3482","endPage":"3489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Forming, SET, and Data Retention of Conductive-Bridge Random-Access Memory for Stack Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Forming, SET, and Data Retention of Conductive-Bridge Random-Access Memory for Stack Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277031/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","volume":"62","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7277031/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15552616","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Forming, SET, and Data Retention of Conductive-Bridge Random-Access Memory for Stack Optimization","sourcePdf":"ted-guy-2476825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090928S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7302109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7302109","articleId":"7277031","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7277032,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Department, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["\u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez (S\u201910) received his Telecommunication Engineering Degree and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

We focus on the case where the number of IA equations matches the number of variables. In this situation, the number of IA solutions is finite and constant for any channel realization out of a zero-measure set and, as we prove in this paper, it is given by an integral formula that can be numerically approximated using Monte Carlo integration methods. More precisely, the number of alignment solutions is the scaled average of the determinant of a certain Hermitian matrix related to the geometry of the problem. Interestingly, while the value of this determinant at an arbitrary point can be used to check the feasibility of the IA problem, its average (properly scaled) gives the number of solutions. For single-beam systems, the asymptotic growth rate of the number of solutions is analyzed and some connections with classical combinatorial problems are presented. Nonetheless, our results can be applied to arbitrary interference MIMO networks, with any number of users, antennas, and streams per user.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Number of Interference Alignment Solutions for the --User MIMO Channel With Constant Coefficients","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2482493","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07277032.pdf","startPage":"6028","endPage":"6048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2482493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Number of Interference Alignment Solutions for the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-User MIMO Channel With Constant Coefficients","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7277032/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524615","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation (MICINN) through the RACHEL Project COSIMA Project","grantNumber":"TEC2013-47141-C4-3-R and TEC2010-19545-C04-03"},{"fundingName":"CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010 through the COMONSENS Project","grantNumber":"CSD2008-00010"},{"fundingName":"Formaci\u00f3n del Profesorado Universitario","grantNumber":"AP2009-1105"},{"fundingName":"MICINN","grantNumber":"MTM2010-16051"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Number of Interference Alignment Solutions for the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-User MIMO Channel With Constant Coefficients","sourcePdf":"tit-santamaria-2482493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110138S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7277032","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7277033,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar Sharma","affiliation":["Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory (iRadio Lab), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085486636"},{"name":"Ramzi Darraji","affiliation":["Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory (iRadio Lab), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Ramzi","lastName":"Darraji","id":"37860320200"},{"name":"Fadhel Ghannouchi","affiliation":["Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory (iRadio Lab), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Fadhel","lastName":"Ghannouchi","id":"38192684700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7277033","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1667},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277033","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power amplifiers","Impedance","Broadband amplifiers","Bandwidth","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband power amplifiers","second-harmonic manipulation","second-harmonic impedance","inverse class-F","F-1 design","frequency 500 MHz","frequency 900 MHz","power 13 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband","inverse class-F","power amplifier","power efficiency","second harmonic tuning","digital pre-distortion"]},{"kwd":["Broadband","digital predistortion","inverse class-F","power amplifier (PA)","power efficiency","second-harmonic tuning"]}],"abstract":"This brief describes a methodology for designing broadband power amplifiers (PAs) based on the manipulation of second-harmonic impedance.

It is shown that the achievable performance can be maintained over a wide frequency range reaching 57% of fractional bandwidth. As such, the proposed approach permits higher flexibility and offers relaxed matching constraints in implementing broadband high-efficiency PAs. For the experimental implementation, the proposed approach is adopted to implement a broadband PA using a 10-W gallium-nitride transistor. Peak drain efficiencies greater than 75% are measured over carrier frequencies between 500 and 900 MHz. The saturated output power levels, on the other hand, are higher than 10 W with a maximum of 13 W.

To protect equipment from lightning, it is necessary to predict surge phenomena in a microwave relay station, and design effective lightning protection methodologies. Recently, numerical electromagnetic field computation methods to solve Maxwell's equations have entered widespread use for analyzing surge phenomena in 3-D structures such as buildings and towers and in grounding structures such as grounding grids. In this paper, we apply the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to the surge analysis of a microwave relay station. First, to validate the applicability of the FDTD method, we set up a reduced-scale model of a microwave relay station. Using this model, we measured the distribution of the currents flowing through the station and compared the measured results with those simulated by the FDTD method. Second, through FDTD-based surge simulations, we analyzed the effects of the reinforcing bars of a building, the route of the ground wire of a waveguide, and the layout of a deep earth electrode on the lightning current distribution.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2015.2476598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

After applying a hardware-sharing scheme to both fast algorithms, the proposed method not only improves the drawback of higher hardware cost in implementation but also retains the regular and flexible nature of recursive discrete Fourier transform (RDFT). The proposed hardware accelerator only costs four real multipliers and ten real adders with a greater reduction (86.7% and 66.7%, respectively) than Kim et al.'s design. In addition, the number of multiplications and additions for 256-point DFT computations can be reduced by 38.6% and 70%, respectively, compared to Lai et al.'s recent approach. For accuracy analysis, the SNR value of the proposed design, at least, is 4 dB higher than the other RDFT designs. Considering a whole evaluation, a very-large-scale integration chip design was further fabricated using TSMC 0.18-\u03bcm 1P6M CMOS process. The core size was only 660 \u00d7 660 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and the measured power consumption was 8.8 mW @ 25 MHz. The result shows that the proposed chip included data memory is 1.38 times the computational efficiency per unit area of Lai et al.'s work. Therefore, it will be the state-of-the-art RDFT processor in the application of various variable-transform-length digital signal processing issues.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7420760/07277036.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7420760","startPage":"279","endPage":"283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Architecture Design for Calculating Variable-Length Fourier Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Architecture Design for Calculating Variable-Length Fourier Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15806137","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7277036/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"103-2221-E-343-001, 101-2218-E006-005 and 101-2221-E006-271"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Architecture Design for Calculating Variable-Length Fourier Transform","sourcePdf":"tcsii-lai-2482238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098822S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7420760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7420760","articleId":"7277036","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7277038,"authors":[{"name":"Noha M.

These operators are designed mainly to improve fitness value while also maintaining diversity in the population, but they do not directly act to reduce constraint violations of constrained problems. Interestingly, the so-called constraint handling techniques, used with most evolutionary algorithms, are not a part of the actual search process. Instead, the constraint violations are only considered in the ranking and selection of individuals for participation in the search process. This paper introduces a new DE mutation operator that incorporates a mechanism, based on constraint consensus, that can directly help to reduce the constraint violations during the evolutionary search process. The proposed DE algorithm has been tested on a set of well-known constrained benchmark problems. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain better solutions, compared to the standard DE algorithm, with significantly reduced computational effort. The algorithm also outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2015.2477402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/7479595/07277038.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2015.2477402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7479595","startPage":"447","endPage":"459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constraint Consensus Mutation-Based Differential Evolution for Constrained Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constraint Consensus Mutation-Based Differential Evolution for Constrained Optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16034201","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7277038/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraint Consensus Mutation-Based Differential Evolution for Constrained Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-hamza-2477402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139514S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"7479595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7479595","articleId":"7277038","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7277041,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ali Sedaghat","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Ali Sedaghat received the B.Sc degree in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran, in 2006 and the M.Sc degree in communication systems from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2008.

One of the commonly used algorithms for processing HRWS-SAR data is Krieger's digital beamforming (DBF) algorithm. This algorithm works quite well for cases with uniform space-time sampling as well as moderately nonuniform sampling. However, for cases with highly nonuniform sampling, Krieger's DBF algorithm in its original form suffers from a severe degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio, and for cases with coinciding sampling, this algorithm even fails to function. In this paper, we will solve these problems such that an improved DBF (IDBF) algorithm is developed. The key of the IDBF algorithm consists of two procedures: The first one implements an operation called ambiguity-index screening, which is based on two novel quantities, termed the equivalent sampling spacing and the effective reconstructed Doppler bandwidth; and the other key procedure implements a Doppler-spectrum weighting based on a newly defined parameter that is termed the maximum-to-minimum ratio of the noise spectrum. Simulation results show that the newly proposed IDBF algorithm shares a pronounced improvement in the imaging performance over Krieger's DBF algorithm. Moreover, simulation results also demonstrate that the IDBF algorithm exhibits a more robust and consistent overall performance than several other existing reconstruction algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2476496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7386543/07277046.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2476496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7386543","startPage":"1209","endPage":"1225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved DBF Algorithm for Multichannel High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved DBF Algorithm for Multichannel High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15720451","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7277046/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41576173"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013156","fundingName":"Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2243141501005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved DBF Algorithm for Multichannel High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR","sourcePdf":"tgrs-liu-2476496-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126346S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7386543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7386543","articleId":"7277046","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7277047,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanshi Zheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Equipment Structure Design of the Ministry of Education and the Center for Complex Systems, School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yuanshi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37900450400"},{"name":"Long Wang","affiliation":["Center for Systems and Control, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280759400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7277047","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1631},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Multi-agent systems","Topology","Protocols","Communication networks","Graph theory","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","directed graphs","discrete time systems","Lyapunov methods","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched multiagent system","continuous time subsystem","CT subsystem","discrete time subsystem","DT subsystem","linear consensus protocol","graph theory","Lyapunov theory","arbitrary switching","undirected connected graph","directed graph","switching topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus","switched multi-agent systems","discrete-time","continuous-time"]},{"kwd":["Consensus","continuous time (CT)","discrete time (DT)","switched multiagent systems"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, we consider the consensus problem of a switched multiagent system composed of continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) subsystems.

Conversion matrices allow for the analysis of an LPTV circuit with equivalent frequency-domain circuits that can, in turn, be analyzed similar to a linear time-invariant circuit. On applying this method to N-path filters, results already established in prior art are accurately reproduced. Furthermore, the effects of a few important nonidealities, such as clock overlaps, nonideal clock duty cycles, and parasitic elements, are also calculated and verified.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7362270/07277048.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7362270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Analysis of --Path Filters Using Conversion Matrices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Analysis of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Path Filters Using Conversion Matrices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277048/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15683794","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277048/","volume":"63","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation under NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS 1408647"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Domain Analysis of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Path Filters Using Conversion Matrices","sourcePdf":"tcsii-hameed-2482418-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099392S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7362270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7362270","articleId":"7277048","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7277050,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Artail","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Bliss Street, Beirut, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/7381712/7277050/artai-small.gif","p":["Hassan Artail received the BS degree with high distinction and the MS\n degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Detroit in 1985 and 1986, and the PhD degree in electrical\n and computer engineering from Wayne State University in 1999.

The anonymity is accomplished based on a system of pseudonym generation, distribution, and replenishing. The road side units (RSUs) play a key role in the framework by receiving the originally generated pseudonyms from the trusted authority, and then distributing pseudonym sets to cars while shuffling the sets amongst themselves to maximize anonymity. The pseudonym distribution process among the RSUs and to the vehicles is highly adaptive to accommodate the needs of the vehicles. We develop a distributed optimization algorithm for the shuffling process and a novel mechanism for cars to change their pseudonyms. Experimental evaluations based on ns3 simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through showing relatively high values of the used metric, namely the anonymity set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15697102","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7277050/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Pseudonym Management System to Achieve Anonymity in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pseudonym Management System to Achieve Anonymity in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tdsc-artail-2480699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088541S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"7381712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7381712","articleId":"7277050","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7277053,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghui Wen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guanghui","lastName":"Wen","id":"37970245000"},{"name":"Michael Z.

An event-triggered sampled-data transmission strategy is designed, which allows the event-triggered condition to be examined only at sampling instants. With the assumption that only some sampled-data outputs of the master system are available to the slave system, a kind of observer-based synchronization controller is constructed and utilized. Based on a delayed-input approach, the master-slave synchronization problem is equivalently converted into the asymptotical stability problem of a time-delay system. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing the free-weighting matrix approach, some sufficient synchronization criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived. Numerical simulations are finally provided to verify the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7420760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7420760/07277053.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Triggered Master\u2013Slave Synchronization With Sampled-Data Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Event-Triggered Master\u2013Slave Synchronization With Sampled-Data Communication","volume":"63","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277053/","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15806127","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277053/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304168"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20130595"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130092120030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP13010765 and DP140100544"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council, Hong Kong","grantNumber":"106140120"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Triggered Master\u2013Slave Synchronization With Sampled-Data Communication","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wen-2482158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115167S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7420760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7420760","articleId":"7277053","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7277055,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Broadband Wireless Mobile Communications, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7348918/7277055/zhou-2477166-small.gif","p":["Tao Zhou received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from the Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, China, in 2009.

Because of the measurement restriction and measurement efficiency issues of applying conventional channel sounders in HSR scenarios, railway-network-based channel measurements are becoming quite attractive. In this paper, a method that employs the cell-specific reference signal in long-term-evolution (LTE) railway networks as the excitation signal to perform HSR channel measurements is presented. This method is implemented by a novel channel measurement system composed of existing LTE railway networks and a dedicated LTE receiver, which can efficiently collect the time-frequency-space channel data and is able to measure different communication links simultaneously. Based on this system, field measurements that consider both direct coverage and relay coverage schemes are conducted on the Beijing-toTianjin HSR in China. Statistical results, involving path loss, Rician K-factor, root-mean-square delay spread, single-link spatial correlation (SC), and multilink SC, are derived, which not only confirm the viability of the proposed method but also provide realistic HSR channel characteristics for the research on future HSR communications.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2015.2477166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7348918/07277055.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2015.2477166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7348918","startPage":"25","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of an LTE-Based Channel Measurement Method for High-Speed Railway Scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of an LTE-Based Channel Measurement Method for High-Speed Railway Scenarios","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277055/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15661597","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7277055/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371070 and 61471030"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142041 and 4152043"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund through the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2014D05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of an LTE-Based Channel Measurement Method for High-Speed Railway Scenarios","sourcePdf":"tim-zhou-2477166-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111515S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7348918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7348918","articleId":"7277055","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7277056,"authors":[{"name":"Mengdi Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"firstName":"Mengdi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085408933"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279769000"},{"name":"Yi Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085426700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7277056","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":905},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Sensor arrays","Adaptive arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Quaternions","Least squares approximations","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","energy consumption","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector-sensor arrays","reweighted zero-attracting quaternion-valued LMS algorithm","reference signal-based adaptive beamforming","energy consumption","large array systems","reweighted zero-attracting quaternion-valued least-mean-square algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vector sensor array","quaternion","adaptive beamforming","LMS","zero attracting"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive beamforming","least mean square (LMS)","quaternion","vector sensor array","zero attracting"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming for Vector-Sensor Arrays Based on a Reweighted Zero-Attracting Quaternion-Valued LMS Algorithm","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7420760","endPage":"278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7420760/07277056.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482464","startPage":"274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277056","abstract":"In this brief, reference signal-based adaptive beamforming for vector sensor arrays consisting of crossed dipoles is studied.

However, available communication, storage, and computation resources of the connected vehicles are not well utilized to meet the service requirements of intelligent transportation systems. Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is a promising approach that makes use of the advantages of cloud computing and applies them to vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose an optimal computation resource allocation scheme to maximize the total long-term expected reward of the VCC system. The system reward is derived by taking into account both the income and cost of the VCC system as well as the variability feature of available resources. Then, the optimization problem is formulated as an infinite horizon semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with the defined state space, action space, reward model, and transition probability distribution of the VCC system. We utilize the iteration algorithm to develop the optimal scheme that describes which action has to be taken under a certain state.

technologies are being constantly developed. However, characterizing them and understanding how to bias for optimal performance are becoming an increasingly tight bottleneck. Here, we propose a novel technique for extracting biasing parameters, conducive to desirable switching behavior in a highly automated manner, thereby shortening the process development cycles. The principle of operation is based on: 1) applying variable amplitude, pulse-mode stimulation on a test device in order to induce switching multiple times; 2) collecting the data on how pulsing parameters affect the device's resistive state; and 3) choosing the most suitable biasing parameters for the application at hand. The utility of the proposed technique is validated on TiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n-based prototypes, where we demonstrate the successful extraction of biasing parameters that allow the operation of our devices both as multistate and binary resistive switches.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2478491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7302109/07277063.pdf","startPage":"3685","endPage":"3691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2478491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An RRAM Biasing Parameter Optimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"An RRAM Biasing Parameter Optimizer","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7277063/","accessionNumber":"15552627","volume":"62","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European FP7 Seventh Framework Programme through RAMP Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K017829/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An RRAM Biasing Parameter Optimizer","sourcePdf":"ted-serb-2478491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07509S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7302109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7302109","articleId":"7277063","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7277070,"authors":[{"name":"Pengpeng Liang","affiliation":["Meitu HiScene Lab, HiScene Information Technologies, Shanghai, China","Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7277070/liang-2482905-small.gif","p":["Pengpeng Liang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Zhengzhou University, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

Despite recent efforts to integrate color in tracking, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the role color information can play. In this paper, we attack this problem by conducting a systematic study from both the algorithm and benchmark perspectives. On the algorithm side, we comprehensively encode 10 chromatic models into 16 carefully selected state-of-the-art visual trackers. On the benchmark side, we compile a large set of 128 color sequences with ground truth and challenge factor annotations (e.g., occlusion). A thorough evaluation is conducted by running all the color-encoded trackers, together with two recently proposed color trackers. A further validation is conducted on an RGBD tracking benchmark. The results clearly show the benefit of encoding color information for tracking. We also perform detailed analysis on several issues, including the behavior of various combinations between color model and visual tracker, the degree of difficulty of each sequence for tracking, and how different challenge factors affect the tracking performance. We expect the study to provide the guidance, motivation, and benchmark for future work on encoding color in visual tracking.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2482905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07277070.pdf","startPage":"5630","endPage":"5644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2482905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoding Color Information for Visual Tracking: Algorithms and Benchmark","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277070","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/83/7271151/7277070-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Encoding Color Information for Visual Tracking: Algorithms and Benchmark","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277070/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15518488","pubMedId":"26415202","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277070/","volume":"24","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"No. 61528204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1218156 and 1350521"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Encoding Color Information for Visual Tracking: Algorithms and Benchmark","sourcePdf":"tip-ling-2482905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189279S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"359","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7277070","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7277082,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Zhuang","affiliation":["Department of Geomatics Engineering, Unversity of Calgary, 2500 University Drive, NW, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7503130/7277082/zhuan-2451641-small.gif","p":["Yuan Zhuang received the PhD degree in geomatics engineering from the\n University of Calgary.

Typically, procedures for building such databases are time-consuming and labour-intensive. In this paper, two autonomous crowdsourcing systems are proposed to build the databases on handheld devices by using our designed algorithms and an inertial navigation solution from a Trusted Portable Navigator (T-PN). The proposed systems, running on smartphones, build and update the database autonomously and adaptively to account for the dynamic environment. To evaluate the performance of automatically generated databases, two improved WiFi positioning schemes (fingerprinting and trilateration) corresponding to these two database building systems, are also discussed. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of two crowdsourcing-based WPSs that eliminate the various limitations of current crowdsourcing-based systems which (a) require a floor plan or GPS, (b) are suitable only for specific indoor environments, and (c) implement a simple MEMS-based sensors' solution. In addition, these two WPSs are evaluated and compared through field tests. Results in different test scenarios show that average positioning errors of both proposed systems are all less than 5.75 m.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2451641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7503130/07277082.pdf","startPage":"1982","endPage":"1995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2451641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7503130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Two WiFi Positioning Systems Based on Autonomous Crowdsourcing of Handheld Devices for Indoor Navigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Two WiFi Positioning Systems Based on Autonomous Crowdsourcing of Handheld Devices for Indoor Navigation","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7277082/","accessionNumber":"16122700","volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004489","fundingName":"Mitacs-Accelerate","grantNumber":"IT02759"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Two WiFi Positioning Systems Based on Autonomous Crowdsourcing of Handheld Devices for Indoor Navigation","sourcePdf":"tmc-zhuang-2451641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129906S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7503130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"7503130","articleId":"7277082","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7277095,"authors":[{"name":"Ammar Gharaibeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7503130/7277095/ghara-2474364-small.gif","p":["Ammar Gharaibeh received the BS degree with honors from the Jordan\n University of Science and Technology in 2006, the MS degrees in computer engineering from Texas A& M University in\n 2009 and is currently working toward the PhD degree in the ECE Department at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.\n His research interests spans the areas of wireless networks and network caching.

The cellular network operator may charge the content providers for caching their contents. Moreover, content providers may lose their users if the users are not getting their desired quality of service, such as maximum tolerable delay in Video on Demand services. In this paper, we study the collaborative caching problem for a multicell-coordinated system from the point of view of minimizing the total cost paid by the content providers. We formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Program and prove its NP-completeness. We also provide an online caching algorithm that does not require any knowledge about the contents popularities. We prove that the online algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of O(log (n)), and we show that the best competitive ratio that any online algorithm can achieve is \u03a9 (log (n) / log log (n)). Therefore, our proposed caching algorithm is provably efficient. Through simulations, we show that our online algorithm performs very close to the optimal offline collaborative scheme, and can outperform it when contents popularities are not properly estimated.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2474364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7503130/07277095.pdf","startPage":"1863","endPage":"1876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2474364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7503130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Provably Efficient Online Collaborative Caching Algorithm for Multicell-Coordinated Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277095/","displayDocTitle":"A Provably Efficient Online Collaborative Caching Algorithm for Multicell-Coordinated Systems","volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16122702","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277095/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1331018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Provably Efficient Online Collaborative Caching Algorithm for Multicell-Coordinated Systems","sourcePdf":"tmc-gharaibeh-2474364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096303S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7503130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7503130","articleId":"7277095","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7277099,"authors":[{"name":"James Sharpnack","affiliation":["Statistics Department, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7358222/7277099/7277099-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["James Sharpnack (M\u201914) received a B.S. in Math and Physics from Ohio State University and a Master's in Statistics and Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University.

This problem is relevant to several applications such as surveillance, disease outbreak detection, biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, etc. Since the activations in these problems often tend to be localized to small groups of vertices in the graphs, we model such activity by a class of signals that are elevated over a (possibly disconnected) cluster with low cut size relative to its size. We analyze the corresponding generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistics and relate it to the problem of finding a sparsest cut in the graph. We develop a convex relaxation of the GLR statistic based on spectral graph theory, which we call the graph Fourier scan statistic (GFSS). In our main theoretical result, we show that the performance of the GFSS depends explicitly on the spectral properties of the graph. To assess the optimality of the GFSS, we prove an information theoretic lower bound for the detection of anomalous activity on graphs. Because the GFSS requires the specification of a tuning parameter, we develop an adaptive version of the GFSS. Using these results, we are able to characterize in a very explicit form the performance of the GFSS on a few notable graph topologies. We demonstrate that the GFSS can efficiently detect a simulated Arsenic contamination in groundwater.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2481866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7358222/07277099.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2481866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Anomalous Activity on Networks With the Graph Fourier Scan Statistic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277099","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7358222/7277099-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277099/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Anomalous Activity on Networks With the Graph Fourier Scan Statistic","volume":"64","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15663193","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277099/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Detecting Anomalous Activity on Networks With the Graph Fourier Scan Statistic","sourcePdf":"tsp-sharpnack-2481866-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128514S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7358222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7358222","articleId":"7277099","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7277100,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7277100/jchoi-2482494-small.gif","p":["Jinho Choi (SM\u201902) was born in Seoul, Korea.

These methods share the common idea that interference can be canceled when its content is known. Existing work on KIC mainly focuses on single-hop or two-hop networks, with physical-layer network coding and full-duplex communications as typical examples. This paper extends the idea of KIC to general multihop networks and proposes an end-to-end KIC (E2E-KIC) transmission method, together with its medium access control (MAC) design. With E2E-KIC, multiple nodes in a flow passing through a few nodes in an arbitrary topology can simultaneously transmit and receive on the same channel. We first present a theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of E2E-KIC in an idealized case. Then, to support E2E-KIC in multihop networks with an arbitrary topology, we propose an E2E-KIC-supported MAC protocol (E2E-KIC MAC), which is based on an extension of the Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send mechanism in the IEEE 802.11 MAC. We also analytically analyze the performance of the proposed E2E-KIC MAC in the presence of hidden terminals. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed E2E-KIC MAC can improve network throughput and reduce end-to-end delay.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Wireless communication","Spread spectrum communication","Topology","Throughput","Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","interference suppression","network coding","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-hop performance","multihop networks","end-to-end known-interference cancellation","wireless data communications","physical-layer transmission","single-hop networks","two-hop networks","physical-layer network coding","full-duplex communications","arbitrary topology","E2E-KIC-supported MAC protocol","request-to-send mechanism","clear-to-send mechanism","IEEE 802.11 MAC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full duplex (FD)","known-interference cancelation (KIC)","medium access control (MAC) protocol design","physical-layer network coding (PNC)","wireless networks"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2482124","startPage":"7606","endPage":"7620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07277102.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2482124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaching Single-Hop Performance in Multihop Networks: End-to-End Known-Interference Cancelation (E2E-KIC)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Approaching Single-Hop Performance in Multihop Networks: End-to-End Known-Interference Cancelation (E2E-KIC)","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16306022","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","volume":"65","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277102/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471109, 9143811 and 61302072"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"N140405005 and N140405007"},{"fundingName":"Liaoning BaiQianWan Talents Program"},{"fundingName":"National High-Level Personnel Special Support Program for Youth Top-Notch Talent"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaching Single-Hop Performance in Multihop Networks: End-to-End Known-Interference Cancelation (E2E-KIC)","sourcePdf":"tvt-guo-2482124-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145119S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7277102","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7277103,"authors":[{"name":"Weihan Li","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7493708/7277103/wli-2479938-small.gif","p":["\n\nWeihan Li (S'13) received the B.S. degree in automotive engineering from \nHefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in \nautomotive engineering.","From September 2012 to August 2014, he was a joint Ph.D. student funded by the China Scholarship Council with the \nGATE Center for Electric Drive Transportation, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of \nMichigan, Dearborn, MI, USA, where he is involved in the modeling and design of wireless chargers for electric vehicles \n(EVs)/plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

Both the well-tuned and mistuned topologies for the two compensation methods are analyzed in detail. The mistuning considered here is mainly caused by the variations of the relative position between the primary and secondary sides. The output power displacements caused by mistuning are compared for both compensation topologies, as well as the impacts of the load variations on the performances of the mistuned topologies. The voltage and current stresses on components are also studied. The comparative result shows that the double-sided LCC compensation topology is less sensitive to mistuning. A double-sided LCC-compensated EV wireless charger system with up to 7.7-kW output power is built to verify the analysis results. A peak efficiency of 96% from dc power source to battery load is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2479938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7493708/07277103.pdf","startPage":"4429","endPage":"4439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2479938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7493708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison Study on SS and Double-Sided LCC Compensation Topologies for EV/PHEV Wireless Chargers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277103","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/7493708/7277103-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277103/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison Study on SS and Double-Sided LCC Compensation Topologies for EV/PHEV Wireless Chargers","volume":"65","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16089083","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277103/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy"},{"fundingName":"U.S.\u2013China Clean Energy Research Center\u2014Clean Vehicle Consortium"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007270","fundingName":"University of Michigan"},{"fundingName":"Hefei University of Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Comparison Study on SS and Double-Sided LCC Compensation Topologies for EV/PHEV Wireless Chargers","sourcePdf":"tvt-mi-2479938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111743S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7493708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"7493708","articleId":"7277103","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":7277106,"authors":[{"name":"Tanumay Datta","affiliation":["Centrale Supelec, Gif sur Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7277106/datta-2451095-small.gif","p":["Tanumay Datta received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2014.","From July 2013 to March 2015, he was with Broadcom Communication Technologies, Bangalore, as Scientist Staff II in the Systems Engineering Group.

Transmit antennas in multiantenna systems and subcarriers in multicarrier systems are examples of such transmit entities that can be used to convey additional information bits through indexing. In this paper, we introduce generalized space and frequency IM, where the indexes of active transmit antennas and subcarriers convey information bits. We first introduce IM in the spatial domain, which is referred to as generalized spatial IM (GSIM). For GSIM, where bits are indexed only in the spatial domain, we derive the expression for achievable rate and easy-to-compute upper and lower bounds on this rate. We show that the achievable rate in GSIM can be more than that in spatial multiplexing and analytically establish the condition under which this can happen. It is noted that GSIM achieves this higher rate using fewer transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains compared with spatial multiplexing. We also propose a Gibbs-sampling-based detection algorithm for GSIM and show that GSIM can achieve better bit error rate (BER) performance than spatial multiplexing. For generalized space-frequency IM (GSFIM), where bits are encoded through indexing in both active antennas and subcarriers, we derive the achievable rate expression. Numerical results show that GSFIM can achieve higher rates compared with conventional multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM). Moreover, BER results show the potential for GSFIM performing better than MIMO-OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2451095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2451095","startPage":"4911","endPage":"4924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07277106.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Space-and-Frequency Index Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Space-and-Frequency Index Modulation","volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141217","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7277106/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Space-and-Frequency Index Modulation","sourcePdf":"tvt-chockalingam-2451095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13281S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7277106","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7277111,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Fainan Hanif","affiliation":["Lancaster University, School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7343816/7277111/7277111-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Fainan Hanif received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2011.

For a linearly precoded multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, we study the downlink sum rate maximization problem, when the NOMA principle is applied. Being a non-convex and intractable optimization problem, we resort to approximate it with a minorization-maximization algorithm (MMA), which is a widely used tool in statistics. In each step of the MMA, we solve a second-order cone program, such that the feasibility set in each step contains that of the previous one, and is always guaranteed to be a subset of the feasibility set of the original problem. It should be noted that the algorithm takes a few iterations to converge. Furthermore, we study the conditions under which the achievable rates maximization can be further simplified to a low complexity design problem, and we compute the probability of occurrence of this event. Numerical examples are conducted to show a comparison of the proposed approach against conventional multiple access systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2480042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7343816/07277111.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2480042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Minorization-Maximization Method for Optimizing Sum Rate in the Downlink of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Minorization-Maximization Method for Optimizing Sum Rate in the Downlink of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277111/","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15647662","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277111/","volume":"64","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Minorization-Maximization Method for Optimizing Sum Rate in the Downlink of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-hanif-2480042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158742S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7343816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"7343816","articleId":"7277111","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7277112,"authors":[{"name":"Tuong Duc Hoang","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique\u2014Centre \u00c9nergie Mat\u00e9riaux T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, H5A 1K6, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7277112/hoang-2482388-small.gif","p":["Tuong Duc Hoang (S'14) received the B.Eng. degree (Honor Program) from Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2010 and the M.S. degree from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2013.

This paper proposes a novel cooperative content dissemination strategy for a heterogeneous network consisting of different types of devices, such as WiFi access points (APs), smartphones, and intelligent vehicles. The proposed strategy offloads a significant proportion of data traffic from cellular networks to WiFi or device-to-device networks using ad hoc connections that opportunistically emerge when mobile devices move and meet one another. The strategy is particularly suited for dissemination of delay-tolerant content. Detailed analysis is provided for the content dissemination process in heterogeneous mobile networks adopting the proposed strategy. On this basis, the optimal parameter settings for the content dissemination strategy are discussed. Simulation and numerical results show that the proposed strategy significantly reduces the amount of data traffic for cellular networks while guaranteeing the successful delivery of content.","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07277118.pdf","startPage":"6573","endPage":"6587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2477363","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2477363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277118","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Mobile computing","Mobile handsets","Ad hoc networks","Encoding","Graphical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cooperative communication","data dissemination","delay tolerant networks","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous mobile networks","delay-tolerant content dissemination","mobile devices","ad hoc connections","intelligent vehicles","smartphones","WiFi access points","cooperative content dissemination strategy","traffic load","device-to-device networks","high-capacity WiFi","cellular networks","mobile data traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content dissemination","data offloading","epidemic broadcast","erasure coding","heterogeneous network","mobile network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277118/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Content Dissemination and Offloading in Heterogeneous Mobile Networks","accessionNumber":"16210013","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7277118/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61428102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Content Dissemination and Offloading in Heterogeneous Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-mao-2477363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119303S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7277118","onlineDate":"25 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7277127,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Lung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7277125/7277127/7277127-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Lung Lin received the B.S. degrees from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008 in electronics engineering.

The input stage of the proposed OTA utilizes a bulk-driven pseudo-differential pair to allow minimum supply voltage while achieving a rail-to-rail input range. All the transistors in the proposed OTA operate in the subthreshold region. Using a novel self-biasing technique to bias the OTA obviates the need for extra biasing circuitry and enhances the performance of the OTA. The proposed technique ensures the OTA robustness to process variations and increases design feasibility under ultra-low-voltage conditions. Moreover, the proposed biasing technique significantly improves the common-mode and power-supply rejection of the OTA. To further enhance the bandwidth and allow the use of smaller compensation capacitors, a compensation network based on a damping-factor control circuit is exploited. The OTA is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology. Measurement results show that the OTA provides a low-frequency gain of 46 dB and rail-to-rail input common-mode range with a supply voltage as low as 0.5 V. The dc gain of the OTA is greater than 42 dB for supply voltage as low as 0.35 V.

However, applications are currently limited to point-to-point-links and do not target single input-multiple output (SIMO) scenarios. New challenges and applications of resonant non-radiative wireless power transfer emphasize the necessity to explore, predict, and assess the behavior of RIC-WPT in SIMO links. Moreover, new system-level metrics have to be derived to study the scalability of multi-point wireless power transfer applications and to provide design guidelines for these systems. In this article a single input-multiple output RIC-WPT system is modeled analytically from a circuit-centric point of view and validated using a finite element field solver. The analytical model and associated closed formulation is finally used to derive system-level metrics to predict the behavior and scalability of RIC SIMO systems, showcasing the results for an asymmetric SIMO scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2015","htmlLink":"/document/7277191/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15484896","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scalability Analysis of SIMO Non-Radiative Resonant Wireless Power Transfer Systems Based on Circuit Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalability Analysis of SIMO Non-Radiative Resonant Wireless Power Transfer Systems Based on Circuit Models","sourcePdf":"tcsi-boubalust-2469015-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086363S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7277125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7277125","articleId":"7277191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7277194,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Te Liao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Chung-Cheng University","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan R.O.C"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7277125/7277194/7277194-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Te Liao (S\u201903\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2003, the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, in 2011.

The proposed accelerometer was fabricated using 0.18- \u03bcm CMOS technology without micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) processing. To reduce manufacturing errors, the bondwire inertial sensors are wire-bonded on the chip pads, thereby enabling a precisely-defined length and space between sensing bondwires. The proposed wireless accelerometer using a pair of 15.2 \u03bcm and 25.4 \u03bcm bondwires achieves a linear transducer gain of 33 mV/g, bandwidth of 5 kHz, a noise floor of 700 \u03bcg/\u221aHz, and 4.5 \u03bcg bias stability. The acceleration data is digitalized by an energy-efficient 10-bit SAR ADC and then wirelessly transmitted in real time to the external reader by a low-power on-off shift keying (OOK) transmitter. The proposed architecture consumes 9 mW and the chip area is 2 mm \u00d7 2.4 mm.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2471595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7277125/07277194.pdf","startPage":"2445","endPage":"2453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2471595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fully-Integrated Wireless Bondwire Accelerometer With Closed-loop Readout Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Fully-Integrated Wireless Bondwire Accelerometer With Closed-loop Readout Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","volume":"62","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277194/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15484902","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan","grantNumber":"100-2218-E-009-030-MY3 and 102-2221-E-009-193-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fully-Integrated Wireless Bondwire Accelerometer With Closed-loop Readout Architecture","sourcePdf":"tcsi-liao-2471595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062033S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7277125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7277125","articleId":"7277194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7277217,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser M.

The Islamic content has also seen an increase in the last two decades. Thus, portions of Qur'anic text, i.e. verse/s, have appeared in many online articles and many of these verses appear with very minimal diacritics or without diacritics since in general online Arabic text do not contain diacritics. Therefore, such text needs to be verified in case of any distortions. In this paper, a zero-watermarking approach is proposed which exploits the characteristics of the Arabic characters without modifying the text, i.e., zero watermarking. The watermark key is based on the characteristics of the host verse/s. A key is generated for each verse of the Qur'an where in the initial stage the surah name/number and verse number/s are verified. The results demonstrate the competence of this approach against random tampering attacks providing 100% detection of any distortion made intentionally or unintentionally to Qur'an text.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Taibah University International Conference on Advances in Information Technology for the Holy Quran and Its Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274114/7277196/07277217.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"46","publicationTitle":"2013 Taibah University International Conference on Advances in Information Technology for the Holy Quran and Its Sciences","doi":"10.1109/NOORIC.2013.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOORIC.2013.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Zero-Watermarking Verification Approach for Quranic Verses in Online Text Documents","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Authentication","Internet","Encoding","Decoding","Distortion","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanities","information dissemination","Internet","natural language processing","text analysis","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-watermarking verification approach","Quranic verse","online text document","Internet","information dissemination","Arabic language","Islamic content","random tampering attack","digital text documents"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["zero-watermarking","Quranic verses","random tampering","authentication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Zero-Watermarking Verification Approach for Quranic Verses in Online Text Documents","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277217/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"15487652","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","conferenceDate":"22-25 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Zero-Watermarking Verification Approach for Quranic Verses in Online Text Documents","confLoc":"Madinah, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"2823a042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048629S","chronDate":"22-25 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"7274114","isNumber":"7277196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274114","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7277196","articleId":"7277217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7277442,"authors":[{"name":"Sami Akin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology Leibniz Universitat, Hannover"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Akin","id":"37393395600"},{"name":"Markus Fidler","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology Leibniz Universitat, Hannover"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Fidler","id":"37268474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8422-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7277442","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Protocols","Decoding","Delays","Fading","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","decoding","encoding","probability","quality of service","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonasymptotic backlog","delay reasoning","HARQ protocol","hybrid-automatic-repeat-request system","error detection","queueing characteristic","data transmission","physical layer characteristic","data link layer","state transition model","decoding efficiency","packet-loss probability","quality-of-service constraint","type-I HARQ","HARQ-chase combining","HARQ-CC","HARQ-incremental redundancy","HARQ-IR","cross-layer analysis","encoding/decoding"]}],"abstract":"Recently, hybrid-automatic-repeat-request (HARQ) systems have been favored in particular state-of-the-art communications systems since they provide the practicality of error detections and corrections aligned with repeat-requests when needed at receivers. The queueing characteristics of these systems have taken considerable focus since the current technology demands data transmissions with a minimum delay provisioning. In this paper, we investigate the effects of physical layer characteristics on data link layer performance in a general class of HARQ systems. Constructing a state transition model that combines queue activity at a transmitter and decoding efficiency at a receiver, we identify the probability of clearing the queue at the transmitter and the packet-loss probability at the receiver. We determine the effective capacity that yields the maximum feasible data arrival rate at the queue under quality-ofservice constraints. In addition, we put forward non-asymptotic backlog and delay bounds. Finally, regarding three different HARQ protocols, namely Type-I HARQ, HARQ-chase combining (HARQ-CC) and HARQ-incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR), we show the superiority of HARQ-IR in delay robustness over the others. However, we further observe that the performance gap between HARQ-CC and HARQ-IR is quite negligible in certain cases. The novelty of our paper is a general cross-layer analysis of these systems, considering encoding/decoding in the physical layer and delay aspects in the data-link layer.","doi":"10.1109/ITC.2015.29","publicationTitle":"2015 27th International Teletraffic Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 27th International Teletraffic Congress","pdfPath":"/iel7/7277133/7277413/07277442.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITC.2015.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277413","startPage":"185","endPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backlog and Delay Reasoning in HARQ System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Backlog and Delay Reasoning in HARQ System","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277442/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487706","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7277442/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backlog and Delay Reasoning in HARQ System","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"8422a185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072003S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7277133","isNumber":"7277413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7277133","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7277413","articleId":"7277442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7277443,"authors":[{"name":"Pierdomenico Fiadino","affiliation":["FTW, Telecommunications Research Center Vienna"],"firstName":"Pierdomenico","lastName":"Fiadino","id":"37073250400"},{"name":"Alessandro D'Alconzo","affiliation":["FTW, Telecommunications Research Center Vienna"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"D'Alconzo","id":"37398077400"},{"name":"Mirko Schiavone","affiliation":["FTW, Telecommunications Research Center Vienna"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Schiavone","id":"37085412160"},{"name":"Pedro Casas","affiliation":["FTW, Telecommunications Research Center Vienna"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Casas","id":"37682055600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8422-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7277443","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Entropy","Radiation detectors","Mobile communication","IP networks","Measurement","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computer network security","Internet","statistical distributions","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RCATool","traffic anomaly detection","traffic anomaly diagnosis","cellular networks","over-the-top Internet services","DNS protocol","OTT","DNS traffic analysis","DNS-related symptomatic features","time-series","entropy","change point detection","full statistical distribution","traffic features","nationwide mobile ISP","real mobile network traffic"]}],"abstract":"The DNS protocol has proved to be a valuable means for identifying and dissecting large-scale anomalies in omnipresent Over The Top (OTT) Internet services. In this paper, we present and evaluate a framework for detecting and diagnosing traffic anomalies via DNS traffic analysis. Detection of such anomalies is achieved by monitoring different DNS-related symptomatic features, flagging a warning as soon as one or more of them show a significant change. The investigation of the root causes for such deviations is done by looking at significant changes in a number of diagnostic features (i.e., device manufacturer and OS, requested host name, error codes, etc.), which convey information directly linked to the potential origins of the detected anomalies. For the purpose of detecting significant changes in the time-series of diagnostic features, we propose two different schemes: the first is based of change point detection applied to the entropy of the considered features, the second considers the full statistical distribution of the traffic features. The proposed solutions are tested and compared using both real and synthetic data from a nationwide mobile ISP, the latter generated from real traffic statistics to resemble the real mobile network traffic. To show the operational value of the proposed framework, we report the results of the diagnosis in two prototypical cases.","doi":"10.1109/ITC.2015.30","publicationTitle":"2015 27th International Teletraffic Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 27th International Teletraffic Congress","pdfPath":"/iel7/7277133/7277413/07277443.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITC.2015.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RCATool - A Framework for Detecting and Diagnosing Anomalies in Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7277443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7277443/","displayDocTitle":"RCATool - A Framework for Detecting and Diagnosing Anomalies in Cellular Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15487698","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7277443/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RCATool - A Framework for Detecting and Diagnosing Anomalies in Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Ghent, Belgium","sourcePdf":"8422a194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109229S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7277133","isNumber":"7277413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7277133","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7277413","articleId":"7277443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7279054,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen H.

Especially, the demand response of datacenters has recently received encouraging efforts due to huge demands and flexible power control knobs of datacenters. However, most current efforts focus on owner-operated datacenters, omitting another critical segment of datacenter business: multitenant colocation. In colocation datacenters, while there exist multiple tenants who manage their own servers, the colocation operator only provides facilities such as cooling, reliable power, and network connectivity. Therefore, colocation has a unique feature that challenges any attempts to design a demand response program: uncoordinated power management among tenants. To tackle this challenge, two incentive mechanisms are proposed to coordinate tenant power consumption for demand response under two different scenarios. First, in the case of economic demand response where the operator can adjust an elastic energy reduction target, we show that there is an interaction between the operator and tenant strategies, where each side maximizes its own benefit. Hence, we apply a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze this scenario and derive this game's equilibria. However, computing these equilibria can be intractable with exhaustive search; therefore, we propose an algorithm to find the Stackelberg equilibria with linear complexity. Second, in the case of emergency demand response where a fixed energy reduction target must be fulfilled, we devise two incentive schemes with the distributed algorithms that can achieve the same optimal social cost. While the first algorithm is based on the dual-decomposition method that is suitable for nonstrategic tenants, the second one is designed for strategic tenants to achieve a unique Nash equilibrium of a bidding game. Finally, trace-based simulations are also provided to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed incentive schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive Mechanisms for Economic and Emergency Demand Responses of Colocation Datacenters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2483420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07279054.pdf","startPage":"2892","endPage":"2905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2483420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279054/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Incentive Mechanisms for Economic and Emergency Demand Responses of Colocation Datacenters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7279054/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602324","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A2A2A01005900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentive Mechanisms for Economic and Emergency Demand Responses of Colocation Datacenters","sourcePdf":"jsac-tran-2483420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118213S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7279054","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279055,"authors":[{"name":"Ernesto Ibarra","affiliation":["University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Ernesto Ibarra received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Barcelona in 2014.

In such networks, the capability of the nodes to detect events is of vital importance and complements the stringent quality of service (QoS) demands in terms of delay, throughput, and packet loss. However, the scarce energy collected by human motions, along with the strict requirements of vital health signals in terms of QoS, raises important challenges for WBANs and stresses the need for new integrated QoS-aware energy management schemes. In this paper, we propose a joint power-QoS (PEH-QoS) control scheme, composed of three modules that interact in order to make optimal use of energy and achieve the best possible QoS. The proposed scheme ensures that a sensor node is able to detect the medical events and transmit the respective data packets efficiently. Extensive simulations, conducted for different human activities (i.e., relaxing, walking, running, and cycling), have shown that the application of PEH-QoS in a medical node increases the detection efficiency, the throughput, and the energy efficiency of the system.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2483064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7362261/07279055.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2483064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7362261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Energy Management in Body Sensor Nodes Powered by Human Energy Harvesting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279055/","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Energy Management in Body Sensor Nodes Powered by Human Energy Harvesting","volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15683693","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279055/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ag\u00e8ncia de Gesti\u00f3 d\u2019Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca Project","grantNumber":"2014-SGR-1551"},{"fundingName":"Wireless Sensor Networks for Quality of Life Project","grantNumber":"286047"},{"fundingName":"Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, NetGNA Group, Covilh\u00e3 Delegation"},{"fundingName":"National Funding through the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/500008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Energy Management in Body Sensor Nodes Powered by Human Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"jsen-antonopoulos-2483064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061138S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7362261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7362261","articleId":"7279055","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279056,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Liu","affiliation":["School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7279056/liu-2481320-small.gif","p":["Haifeng Liu received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Software.

Recently, with the rapid proliferation of information technology, research papers are rapidly published in various conferences and journals. This makes citation recommendation a highly important and challenging discipline. In this paper, we propose a novel citation recommendation method that uses only easily obtained citation relations as source data. The rationale underlying this method is that, if two citing papers are significantly co-occurring with the same citing paper(s), they should be similar to some extent. Based on the above rationale, an association mining technique is employed to obtain the paper representation of each citing paper from the citation context. Then, these paper representations are pairwise compared to compute similarities between the citing papers for collaborative filtering. We evaluate our proposed method through two relevant real-world data sets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline method in terms of precision, recall, and F1, as well as mean average precision and mean reciprocal rank, which are metrics related to the rank information in the recommendation list.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07279056.pdf","startPage":"1695","endPage":"1703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2481320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2481320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Based Collaborative Filtering for Citation Recommendation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Filtering","Citation recommendation","Context modeling","Text mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["citation analysis","collaborative filtering","data mining","recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-based collaborative filtering","information overload","information technology","citation recommendation method","association mining technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Citation Recommendation","Collaborative Filtering","Citation Context","Citation Relation Matrix","Association Mining"]},{"kwd":["Citation recommendation","collaborative filtering","citation context","citation relation matrix","association mining"]}],"topic":"Challenges for Smart Worlds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Context-Based Collaborative Filtering for Citation Recommendation","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7279056/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15494233","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fund of Key Laboratory of Control Engineering of Henan Province, Henan Polytechnic University, Kaifeng, China","grantNumber":"KG2014-11"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT15QY06 and DUT15YQ112"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51209036, 61174174 and 61203165"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Context-Based Collaborative Filtering for Citation Recommendation","sourcePdf":"access-kong-2481320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095911S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Challenges for Smart Worlds"],"articleId":"7279056","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279057,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7279057/jinfu-2483438-small.gif","p":["Jing Fu (S\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2011, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering at City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.

One effective approach is to optimize power consumption of server farms by controlling the carried load on the networked servers. In this paper, we propose a robust heuristic policy called E* for stochastic job assignment in a server farm, aiming to improve the energy efficiency by maximizing the ratio of job throughput to power consumption. Our model of the server farm considers a parallel system of finite-buffer processor-sharing queues with heterogeneous server speeds and energy consumption rates. We devise E* as an insensitive policy so that the stationary distribution of the number of jobs in the system depends on the job size distribution only through its mean. We provide a rigorous analysis of E* and compare it with a baseline approach, known as most energy-efficient server first (MEESF), that greedily chooses the most energy-efficient servers for job assignment. We show that E* has always a higher job throughput than that of MEESF, and derive realistic conditions under which E* is guaranteed to outperform MEESF in energy efficiency. Extensive numerical results are presented and demonstrate that E* can improve the energy efficiency by up to 100%.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2483438","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07279057.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2483438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"2878","endPage":"2891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Heuristics for Insensitive Job Assignment in Processor-Sharing Server Farms","volume":"33","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7279057/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15602357","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007567","fundingName":"City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong","grantNumber":"9380044"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Heuristics for Insensitive Job Assignment in Processor-Sharing Server Farms","sourcePdf":"jsac-guo-2483438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107293S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7279057","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7279061,"authors":[{"name":"Keshav Sood","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Melbourne, Vic., Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7523345/7279061/ksood-2480421-small.gif","p":["Keshav Sood (GSM\u201915) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics engineering (with distinction) and M.Tech. degree in optical fiber engineering from Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar, India, in 2007 and 2012, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in information technology (IT) at Deakin University, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.","He was a Trainee with the Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratory, Chandigarh, India.

Energy consumption models are pivotal in designing and optimizing energy-efficient operations to curb excessive energy consumption in data centers. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art techniques used for energy consumption modeling and prediction for data centers and their components. We conduct an in-depth study of the existing literature on data center power modeling, covering more than 200 models. We organize these models in a hierarchical structure with two main branches focusing on hardware-centric and software-centric power models. Under hardware-centric approaches we start from the digital circuit level and move on to describe higher-level energy consumption models at the hardware component level, server level, data center level, and finally systems of systems level. Under the software-centric approaches we investigate power models developed for operating systems, virtual machines and software applications. This systematic approach allows us to identify multiple issues prevalent in power modeling of different levels of data center systems, including: i) few modeling efforts targeted at power consumption of the entire data center ii) many state-of-the-art power models are based on a few CPU or server metrics, and iii) the effectiveness and accuracy of these power models remain open questions. Based on these observations, we conclude the survey by describing key challenges for future research on constructing effective and accurate data center power models.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2481183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/07279063.pdf","startPage":"732","endPage":"794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2481183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Center Energy Consumption Modeling: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","displayDocTitle":"Data Center Energy Consumption Modeling: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279063/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15730355","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279063/","volume":"18","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Energy Innovation Research Program (EIRP)"},{"fundingName":"Energy Innovation Programme Office (EIPO)"},{"fundingName":"Energy Market Authority, Singapore"},{"fundingName":"Microsoft Research Asia and Cisco Systems, Inc"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Data Center Energy Consumption Modeling: A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-dayarathna-2481183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.517031S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"373","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"7279063","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7279065,"authors":[{"name":"Liangtian Wan","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Systems, Hohai University, Changzhou, China","Guangdong Petrochemical Equipment Fault Diagnosis Key Laboratory, Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7279065/wan-2482981-small.gif","p":["Liangtian Wan (M\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2011 and 2015, respectively.","He is currently a Visiting Scholar with Hohai University, Changzhou, China.

Then, multiple battlefield surveillance systems can be connected together to form a battlefield surveillance network. The mobile nodes can be deployed in a certain region to monitor enemy aircrafts and missiles. Thus, some important issues have to be solved efficiently, including the cooperation across the administrative domains of a cloud network, the direction-of-arrival (DOA), and a polarization estimation algorithm for a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN). In this paper, the architecture of a battlefield surveillance system is constructed based on mobile cloud computing and 5G link. The root multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC)-like algorithm is proposed for estimating the 1-D DOA and a polarization parameter with a uniform linear array. The Root-MUSIC algorithm is replaced by the Fourier transform, the former algorithm that can be extended to an arbitrary topology structure of a MWSN. Then, the proposed algorithm is extended to the 2-D DOA and a polarization estimation in further. Based on the deployment of different MWSNs, the estimation results of DOA and polarization parameters are fused in order to improve the estimation performance. Finally, the parameter information (DOA and polarization parameter) of enemy aircrafts and missiles can be achieved. The computer simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm ensures the parameter estimation accuracy with a low computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2482981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07279065.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2482981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Parameter Estimation for Mobile Wireless Sensor Network Based on Cloud Computing in Battlefield Surveillance System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279065","topic":"Challenges for Smart Worlds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Parameter Estimation for Mobile Wireless Sensor Network Based on Cloud Computing in Battlefield Surveillance System","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15494249","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7279065/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qing Lan Project"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572172, 61401147 and 61401107"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20140248"},{"fundingName":"Open Fund through the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Petrochemical Equipment Fault Diagnosis","grantNumber":"PEFD2015-06"},{"fundingName":"Educational Commission of Guangdong Province, China","grantNumber":"2013KJCX0131"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong High-Tech Development Fund","grantNumber":"2013B010401035"},{"fundingName":"2013 Special Fund of Guangdong Higher School Talent Recruitment"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Distributed Parameter Estimation for Mobile Wireless Sensor Network Based on Cloud Computing in Battlefield Surveillance System","sourcePdf":"access-han-2482981-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085366S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Challenges for Smart Worlds"],"articleId":"7279065","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279077,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Garrido","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Garrido","id":"37424933800"},{"name":"Petter K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petter","lastName":"K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m","id":"38235097300"},{"name":"Martin Kumm","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kumm","id":"37396252100"},{"name":"Oscar Gustafsson","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Gustafsson","id":"37085587811"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7279077","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2806},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279077","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Adders","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Convergence","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORDIC II","rotation angle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CORDIC","rotation","friend angles","USR","CORDIC","nano-rotation"]},{"kwd":["CORDIC","friend angles","nanorotation","rotation","uniformly scaled redundant (USR) CORDIC"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, we present the CORDIC II algorithm.

In this paper, we propose algorithms to improve spectrum sensing performance when the system contains both honest and malicious SUs all of whom may be experiencing correlated fading channels. We show that, when the SUs' reports at each time slot are independent and identically distributed, it is impossible to distinguish between malicious collaboration, i.e., collusion, and correlations caused by the environment. Thus, the optimal test statistic for cooperative spectrum sensing depends on the correlations in the SU reports but not on the source of these correlations. We propose two algorithms: one to identify SUs whose reports are correlated and another to infer the spectrum occupancy by using the learned structure of correlations. Groups of SUs whose reports are correlated are identified by learning the structure of the underlying Bayesian network model. This structure is implemented as a factor graph to infer the spectrum occupancy using a loopy belief propagation algorithm. We derive an upper bound of the error probability of the proposed structure learning algorithm and prove convergence of our loopy belief propagation algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677207","htmlLink":"/document/7279081/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in the Presence of Correlated and Malicious Cognitive Radios","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1117600"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in the Presence of Correlated and Malicious Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"tcomm-laghate-2483497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091211S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7279081","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7279083,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Khansefid","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7279083/khans-2482965-small.gif","p":["Amin Khansefid (S\u201906) received the B.S. degrees in electrical engineering and mathematics, both from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2008.

In multicell environments, adjacent cells using the same spectrum cause a pilot contamination problem and degrade CSI quality. Under such practical environments, it is important to assess achievable rate of the system for a proper system design. There exist achievable rate bounds of uplink (UL) systems in the literature, but general closed-form rate bounds for downlink (DL) systems are not available yet. This paper studies a practical massive MIMO DL system with or without pilot-aided coherent detection under the scenario of pilot contamination, and derives closed-form approximate achievable DL rate expressions for both maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero forcing (ZF) precoders. For the case with DL pilot, a corresponding DL effective channel estimator is also developed. Numerical simulation results corroborate accuracy of the closed-form rate expressions and they also show performance characteristics of pilot-contaminated massive MIMO DL systems with MRC and ZF precoders.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2482965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07279083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2482965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","startPage":"4849","endPage":"4864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Downlink Rates of MRC and ZF Precoders in Massive MIMO With Uplink and Downlink Pilot Contamination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Downlink Rates of MRC and ZF Precoders in Massive MIMO With Uplink and Downlink Pilot Contamination","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677210","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7279083/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Downlink Rates of MRC and ZF Precoders in Massive MIMO With Uplink and Downlink Pilot Contamination","sourcePdf":"tcomm-khansefid-2482965-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089006S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7279083","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7279085,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Bazzi","affiliation":["Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche-Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Infomazione e delle Telecomunicazioni (CNR-IEIIT), Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Bazzi","id":"37552991200"},{"name":"Barbara M.

Furthermore, we introduce a novel analytical framework to evaluate the resource occupation of the beaconing service in LTE and compare the results with those obtained using LTE for vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2482977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7358209/07279085.pdf","startPage":"685","endPage":"688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2482977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of V2V Beaconing Using LTE in Direct Mode With Full Duplex Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279085/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of V2V Beaconing Using LTE in Direct Mode With Full Duplex Radios","volume":"4","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677448","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279085/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CNR project ICT for smart mobility (ICT4SM)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of V2V Beaconing Using LTE in Direct Mode With Full Duplex Radios","sourcePdf":"lwc-bazzi-2482977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049247S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7358209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7358209","articleId":"7279085","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279088,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Ma","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7586170/7279088/ma-2477879-small.gif","p":["Bo Ma received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2003.","From 2004 to 2006, he was with the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, involving on research projects in computer vision and pattern recognition.

Recently, local sparse representation has been successfully applied to visual tracking, owing to its discriminative nature and robustness against local noise and partial occlusions. Local sparse codes computed with a template actually form a three-order tensor according to their original layout, although most existing pooling operators convert the codes to a vector by concatenating or computing statistics on them. We argue that, compared to pooling vectors, the tensor form could deliver more intrinsic structural information for the target appearance, and can also avoid high dimensionality learning problems suffered in concatenation-based pooling methods. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to represent target templates and candidates directly with sparse coding tensors, and build the appearance model by incrementally learning on these tensors. We propose a discriminative framework to further improve robustness of our method against drifting and environmental noise. Experiments on a recent comprehensive benchmark indicate that our method performs better than state-of-the-art trackers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7279088/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378834","pubMedId":"26441435","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative Tracking Using Tensor Pooling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472036 and 61272359"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB328805"},{"fundingName":"Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003213","fundingName":"Specialized Fund for Joint Building Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative Tracking Using Tensor Pooling","sourcePdf":"tcyb-shen-2477879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116924S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7586170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7586170","articleId":"7279088","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279091,"authors":[{"name":"Souhir Lajnef","affiliation":["Electronics Laboratory, Physics Department, Faculty of Sciences, University of Tunis El Manar, El-Manar, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Souhir","lastName":"Lajnef","id":"37085632130"},{"name":"Noureddine Boulejfen","affiliation":["Electronics Laboratory, Physics Department, Faculty of Sciences, University of Tunis El Manar, El-Manar, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Noureddine","lastName":"Boulejfen","id":"38287824400"},{"name":"Abubaker Abdelhafiz","affiliation":["iRadio Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, Schulich Engineering School, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Abubaker","lastName":"Abdelhafiz","id":"37077881600"},{"name":"Fadhel M.

With the deployment of these systems, the radio-frequency front ends and power amplifiers (PAs) used exhibit many nonlinear effects leading to signal distortions. The use of a linearization technique is necessary to enhance the linearity-efficiency tradeoff. This brief explores new schemes suitable for the modeling and linearization of transmitters suffering from hardware imperfections when driven with dual-band signals. An enhanced and accurate 2-D Cartesian memory polynomial model (2DECMPM) is proposed to compensate for hardware impairments such as the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I-Q) imbalance and dc offset in addition to nonlinear distortion. From an accuracy perspective, the proposed model offers better compensation performance, mainly due to the use of additional cross-terms between I and Q signals compared to the 2-D joint memory polynomial model (2DJMPM). Experimental results show that the proposed 2DECMPM-based predistorter enabled superior PA linearization and I-Q imbalance compensation with a comparable complexity with the state-of-the-art 2DJMPM model.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","startPage":"14","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7362270","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7362270/07279091.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Polynomials","Modulation","Computational modeling","Radio transmitters","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearisation techniques","polynomials","radio transmitters","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional cartesian memory polynomial model","I/Q imperfection compensation","concurrent dual-band transmitters","radiofrequency front ends","power amplifiers","nonlinear effects","signal distortions","linearization technique","linearity-efficiency tradeoff","dual band signals","hardware impairments","in-phase imbalance","quadrature-phase imbalance","2D joint memory polynomial model","2DJMPM","2DECMPM-based predistorter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Concurrent dual-band","digital predistortion","I/Q imbalance","memory effects","linearization","power amplifier"]},{"kwd":["Concurrent dual band","digital predistortion (DPD)","I/Q imbalance","linearization","memory effects","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Cartesian Memory Polynomial Model for Nonlinearity and I/Q Imperfection Compensation in Concurrent Dual-Band Transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279091/","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7279091/","accessionNumber":"15683791","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Cartesian Memory Polynomial Model for Nonlinearity and I/Q Imperfection Compensation in Concurrent Dual-Band Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tcsii-lajnef-2482678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043315S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7362270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7362270","articleId":"7279091","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7279093,"authors":[{"name":"Wameedh Nazar Flayyih","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq"],"firstName":"Wameedh Nazar","lastName":"Flayyih","id":"37085615483"},{"name":"Khairulmizam Samsudin","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Khairulmizam","lastName":"Samsudin","id":"37395232700"},{"name":"Shaiful Jahari Hashim","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Shaiful Jahari","lastName":"Hashim","id":"37412581600"},{"name":"Yehea I.

The power consumption is also reduced compared to that of the conventional scheme; the energy efficiency is 104 fJ/b/mm, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2483158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2483158","startPage":"1207","endPage":"1211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8048686/07279097.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2-Gb/s/ch Data-Dependent Swing-Limited On-Chip Signaling for Single-Ended Global I/O in SDRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A 2-Gb/s/ch Data-Dependent Swing-Limited On-Chip Signaling for Single-Ended Global I/O in SDRAM","volume":"64","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17205545","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7279097/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004085","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","grantNumber":"NRF-2011-0020128"},{"fundingName":"Multi-Project Wafer of IC Design Education Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2-Gb/s/ch Data-Dependent Swing-Limited On-Chip Signaling for Single-Ended Global I/O in SDRAM","sourcePdf":"tcsii-kim-2483158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086028S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8048686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8048686","articleId":"7279097","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7279098,"authors":[{"name":"Fangfei Li","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fangfei","lastName":"Li","id":"37085759363"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7279098","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Switches","Control design","Circuits and systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Neural networks","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","matrix algebra","network theory (graphs)","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pinning control design algorithm","synchronization","coupled Boolean networks","BN","drive-response configuration","transition matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boolean network","semi-tensor product","synchronization","pinning control design"]},{"kwd":["Boolean network (BN)","pinning control design","semitensor product (STP)","synchronization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279098","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7420760/07279098.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482658","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7420760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pinning Control Design for the Synchronization of Two Coupled Boolean Networks","abstract":"This brief investigates a pinning control design for the synchronization of two Boolean networks (BNs) coupled in the drive-response configuration.

In some applications, such as networking, a few control bits are added to the data to facilitate their processing. For example, flags to mark the start or the end of a packet are widely used. Therefore, it is important to have SEC codes that protect both the data and the associated control bits. It is attractive for these codes to provide fast decoding of the control bits, as these are used to determine the processing of the data and are commonly on the critical timing path. In this brief, a method to extend SEC codes to support a few additional control bits is presented. The derived codes support fast decoding of the additional control bits and are therefore suitable for networking applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15754933","htmlLink":"/document/7279100/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Method to Design Single Error Correction Codes With Fast Decoding for a Subset of Critical Bits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method to Design Single Error Correction Codes With Fast Decoding for a Subset of Critical Bits","sourcePdf":"tcsii-reviriego-2483362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050618S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7394206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7394206","articleId":"7279100","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279101,"authors":[{"name":"Peyman Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"38252248900"},{"name":"Brent Maundy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Maundy","id":"37269998100"},{"name":"A.

Based on the framework of nonsmooth analysis, some discontinuous or continuous controllers are designed to force the coupled networks to synchronize to an isolated neural network. Some sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the FTS by utilizing the well-known finite-time stability theorem for nonlinear systems. Compared with the previous literatures, such synchronization objective will be realized when the activations and the controllers are both discontinuous. The obtained results in this paper include and extend the earlier works on the synchronization issue of coupled networks with Lipschitz continuous conditions. Moreover, an upper bound of the settling time for synchronization is estimated.

Communication","abstract":"A peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)-aware dual-mode power amplifier (PA) for short-range wireless communication in the subgigahertz band is proposed in this brief. By carefully choosing the bias, the dual-mode PA achieves the measured output P1 dB (OP1 dB) of 13.6 dBm with a PAE of 25.5%. Furthermore, a dynamic load modulation network is utilized to optimize the PA's efficiency at back-off power. A power-control loop is proposed to detect the input signal PAPR in real time and flexibly reconfigure the PA's operation modes. With these proposed techniques, the PAE has been improved by \u00d72.61 at 7-dB back-off power. The measurement shows that the subgigahertz-band PA archives an adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR1) of -37.3 dBc and an average/peak error vector magnitude of -30.4 dB/-20.5 dB at 8.9-dBm output power for ~5-dB-PAPR 16-quadrature-magnitude-modulation LTE signals with 5-MHz bandwidth with the power control loop enabled.

For such, the local channel state information comparison and decision feedback mechanism are merged into classical analog network coding (ANC) and time division broadcast (TDBC) protocols such that the cooperative role of each node can be designated in a distributed fashion. We refer to this distributed role selection rule as d-ROSE. In both ANC-based and TDBC-based two-way relaying scenarios, strict proof for the equivalence of d-ROSE and optimal ROSE is given, which indicates that albeit the different form, their final role decision is essentially the same. Outage analysis for the d-ROSE strategy is carried out and the scaling law of the system outage behavior at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is characterized, which manifests that d-ROSE can enhance the system diversity gain to one-order higher relative to the ANC and TDBC protocols. It is also shown that d-ROSE can reduce the signaling overhead upto 60% to perform the outage-optimal role selection. Finally, the impacts of node placement on the outage performance as well as the average signaling overhead of d-ROSE are numerically evaluated and some useful conclusions are drawn.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2482963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","startPage":"4727","endPage":"4742","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07279107.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2482963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Role Selection With ANC and TDBC Protocols in Two-Way Relaying Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Information exchange","Fading channels","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast communication","channel coding","cooperative communication","diversity reception","network coding","numerical analysis","relay networks (telecommunication)","signalling protocols","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical evaluation","cooperative node placement","outage-optimal role selection","signaling overhead reduction","diversity gain","high SNR","high signal-to-noise ratio","time division broadcast protocol","analog network coding","decision feedback mechanism","local channel state information","distributed role selection strategy","two-way relaying transmission system","TDBC protocol","ANC protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic analysis","distributed role selection","diversity order","outage probability","two-way relaying"]},{"kwd":["Asymptotic analysis","distributed role selection","diversity order","outage probability","two-way relaying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Role Selection With ANC and TDBC Protocols in Two-Way Relaying Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7279107/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15677216","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004480","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi province","grantNumber":"S2014JC13058"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301135"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of ISN","grantNumber":"ISN15-05"},{"fundingName":"R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2014KJXX-49"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372067"},{"fundingName":"CNPq","grantNumber":"304301/2014-0"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"NPRP 5-250-2-087"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Role Selection With ANC and TDBC Protocols in Two-Way Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ding-2482963-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096177S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7279107","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7279110,"authors":[{"name":"Ajinkya Rajandekar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ajinkya","lastName":"Rajandekar","id":"38474158200"},{"name":"Biplab Sikdar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Biplab","lastName":"Sikdar","id":"37085369235"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7279110","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":541},"abstract":"Machine to machine (M2M) communications enable autonomous communication between devices and are an integral part of the Internet of Things (IoT).

To solve this problem, we propose an improved Rayleigh channel generator with guaranteed stability.

For channels without input constraints, various estimates on the amount of such contraction are known, Dobrushin's coefficient for the total variation being perhaps the most well-known. This paper investigates channels with an average input cost constraint. It is found that, while the contraction coefficient typically equals one (no contraction), the information nevertheless dissipates. A certain nonlinear function, the Dobrushin curve of the channel, is proposed to quantify the amount of dissipation. Tools for evaluating the Dobrushin curve of additive-noise channels are developed based on coupling arguments. Some basic applications in stochastic control, uniqueness of Gibbs measures, and fundamental limits of noisy circuits are discussed. As an application, it is shown that, in the chain of n power-constrained relays and Gaussian channels, the end-to-end mutual information and maximal squared correlation decay as O(log log n/log n), which is in stark contrast with the exponential decay in chains of discrete channels. Similarly, the behavior of noisy circuits (composed of gates with bounded fan-in) and broadcasting of information on trees (of bounded degree) does not experience threshold behavior in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Furthermore, each user is also equipped with some initial energy, which generalizes the previous works on energy transfer and initial energy. Our goal is to maximize the system energy efficiency while guaranteeing the user's quality of service via joint time allocation and power control in both DL and UL. We find that the power station always transmits with the maximum power in DL while the transmit power of users in UL follows the waterfilling structure. In addition, the time allocation between DL and UL can be simplified into a linear programming problem. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal solution.

Recently, a number of wireless acquisition systems to measure EEG and other physiological signals have become available. Few studies have applied such wireless systems to assess cognitive workload and evaluate their performance. This paper presents an initial step to explore the feasibility of a popular wireless system (Emotiv EPOC headset) to assess memory workload levels in a well-known n-back task. We developed a signal processing and classification framework, which integrated an automatic artifact removal algorithm, a broad spectrum of feature extraction techniques, a personalized feature scaling method, an information-theory-based feature selection approach, and a proximal-support-vector-machine-based classification model. The experimental results show that the wirelessly collected EEG signals can be used to classify different memory workload levels for nine participants. The classification accuracies between the lowest workload level (0-back) and active workload levels (1-, 2-, 3-back) were close to 100%. The best classification accuracy for 1- versus 2-back was 80%, and 1- versus 3-back was 84%. This study indicates that the wireless acquisition system and the advanced data analytics and pattern recognition techniques are promising to achieve real-time monitoring and identification of mental workload levels for humans engaged in a wide variety of cognitive activities in the modern society.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/7469933/07279121.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2015.2476818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2015.2476818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Wireless EEG Signals to Assess Memory Workload in the --Back Task","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Wireless communication","Accuracy","Headphones","Brain modeling","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","electroencephalography","feature extraction","feature selection","medical signal detection","signal classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless EEG signals","memory workload assessment","n-back task","mental workload assessment","physiological measures","electroencephalography signal","wireless acquisition systems","physiological signals","cognitive workload assessment","Emotiv EPOC headset","signal processing","signal classification framework","automatic artifact removal algorithm","feature extraction techniques","personalized feature scaling method","information-theory-based feature selection approach","proximal-support-vector-machine-based classification model","1-versus 2-back","advanced data analytics","pattern recognition techniques","real-time monitoring","mental workload level identification","cognitive activities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","cognitive workload","electroencephalogram (EEG)","feature selection","memory load","wireless neuroimaging systems"]},{"kwd":["Classification","cognitive workload","electroencephalogram (EEG)","feature selection","memory load","wireless neuroimaging systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Using Wireless EEG Signals to Assess Memory Workload in the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\"> $n$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Back Task","volume":"46","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7279121/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15989086","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Wireless EEG Signals to Assess Memory Workload in the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\"> $n$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Back Task","sourcePdf":"thms-chaovalitwongse-2476818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10927S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"7469933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7469933","articleId":"7279121","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279122,"authors":[{"name":"Juliano B.

Although vehicle position can be obtained by GNSS devices, they are susceptible to errors and satellite signal unavailability in urban scenarios. Several map-aided localization solution methods have been proposed in the literature, but mostly for indoor environments. Maps used for localization store relevant environmental features that are extracted by a detection method. However, many feature detection methods do not consider the presence of dynamic obstacles or occlusions in the environment, which can impair the localization performance. In order to detect curbs even in occluding scenes, we developed a method based on ring compression analysis and least trimmed squares. For road marking detection, we developed a modified version of the Otsu thresholding method to segment road painting from road surfaces. Finally, the feature detection methods were integrated with a Monte Carlo localization method to estimate the vehicle position. Experimental tests in urban streets have been used to validate the proposed approach with favorable results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Detection for Vehicle Localization in Urban Environments Using a Multilayer LIDAR","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2477817","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7394960/07279128.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2477817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279128/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Feature Detection for Vehicle Localization in Urban Environments Using a Multilayer LIDAR","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7279128/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15754899","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001807","fundingName":"FAPESP","grantNumber":"2012/02354-1 and 2014/09096-3"},{"fundingName":"Mobile Robots Laboratory Team"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Detection for Vehicle Localization in Urban Environments Using a Multilayer LIDAR","sourcePdf":"tits-hata-2477817-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055492S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7394960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7394960","articleId":"7279128","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7279130,"authors":[{"name":"Peppino Fazio","affiliation":["DIMES Department, Rende (CS), Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7503130/7279130/fazio-2465384-small.gif","p":["Peppino Fazio received the degree in computer science engineering in\n May 2004.

Nowadays, distributed mobile wireless computing is becoming a very important communication paradigm, due to its flexibility to adapt to different mobile applications. In this work, an interference aware metric is proposed in order to reduce the level of interference between each pair of nodes at the MAC and routing layer. In particular, this metric with a prediction algorithm is proposed to work in a cross-layered MAC and an on-demand routing scheme in multi-radio vehicular networks, wherein each node is equipped with two multi-channel radio interfaces. The proposed metric is based on the maximization of the average signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) level of the connection between source and destination. In order to relieve the effects of the cochannel interference perceived by mobile nodes, transmission channels are switched on a basis of a periodical SIR evaluation. Our solution has been integrated with an on-demand routing scheme but it can be applied to other routing strategies. Three on-demand interference aware routing schemes integrating IEEE 802.11p Multi-channel MAC have been tested to assess the benefits of the novel metric applied to a vehicular context. NS-3 has been used for implementing and testing the proposed idea, and significant performance improvements were obtained: in particular, the proposed policy has resulted in an enhancement of network performance in terms of throughput and packet delivery ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","volume":"15","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"16122705","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279130/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Predictive Cross-Layered Interference Management in a Multichannel MAC with Reactive Routing in VANET","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Predictive Cross-Layered Interference Management in a Multichannel MAC with Reactive Routing in VANET","sourcePdf":"tmc-derango-2465384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153326S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7503130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7503130","articleId":"7279130","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7279137,"authors":[{"name":"Aosen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Aosen Wang (S\u201915) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Aosen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085367063"},{"name":"Feng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Feng Lin (M\u201915) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085696067"},{"name":"Zhanpeng Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Binghamton University, State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhanpeng Jin (S\u201908\u2013M\u201911) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Zhanpeng","lastName":"Jin","id":"37404401000"},{"name":"Wenyao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Wenyao Xu (M\u201914) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Wenyao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37597167400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-3203"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0050"}],"articleNumber":"7279137","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":858},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-smc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ies/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Sensors","Wireless communication","Computer architecture","Optimized production technology","Compressed sensing","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","body sensor networks","compressed sensing","health care","medical signal processing","sampling methods","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["configurable energy-efficient compressed sensing architecture","body sensor networks","healthcare","embedded systems","wireless communication","sub-Nyquest sampling rate","biosignal reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body sensor networks (BSNs)","compressed sensing (CS)","configurable architecture","quantization effect","RapQCS"]},{"kwd":["Body sensor networks (BSNs)","compressed sensing (CS)","configurable architecture","quantization effect","RapQCS"]}],"abstract":"The past decades have witnessed a rapid surge in new sensing and monitoring devices for well-being and healthcare. One key representative in this field is body sensor networks (BSNs). However, with advances in sensing technologies and embedded systems, wireless communication has gradually become one of the dominant energy-consuming sectors in BSN applications. Recently, compressed sensing (CS) has attracted increasing attention in solving this problem due to its enabled sub-Nyquest sampling rate. In this paper, we investigate the quantization effect in CS architecture and argue that the quantization configuration is a critical factor of the energy efficiency for the entire CS architecture. To this end, we present a novel configurable quantized compressed sensing (QCS) architecture, in which the sampling rate and quantization are jointly explored for better energy efficiency. Furthermore, to combat the computational complexity of the configuration procedure, we propose a rapid configuration algorithm, called RapQCS. According to the experiments involving several categories of real biosignals, the proposed configurable QCS architecture can gain more than 66% performance-energy tradeoff than the fixed QCS architecture. Moreover, our proposed RapQCS algorithm can achieve over 150\u00d7 speedup on average, while decreasing the reconstructed signal fidelity by only 2.32%.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2482946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7398213/07279137.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2482946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Configurable Energy-Efficient Compressed Sensing Architecture With Its Application on Body Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279137","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9424/7398213/7279137-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279137/","displayDocTitle":"A Configurable Energy-Efficient Compressed Sensing Architecture With Its Application on Body Sensor Networks","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755397","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279137/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000179","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1423061/1422417, ECCS-1462498/146247 and CNS-1547167"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Configurable Energy-Efficient Compressed Sensing Architecture With Its Application on Body Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-xu-2482946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086639S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7398213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7398213","articleId":"7279137","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279143,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A key factor to design a DSA network is the spectrum sensing algorithms for multiple channels with multiple users. Multi-user cooperative channel sensing reduces the sensing time, and thus it increases transmission throughput. However, in a multi-channel system, the problem becomes more complex since the benefits of assigning users to sense channels in parallel must also be considered. A sensing schedule, indicating to each user the channel that it should sense at different sensing moments, must be thus created to optimize system performance. In this paper, we formulate the general sensing scheduling optimization problem and then propose several sensing strategies to schedule the users according to network parameters with homogeneous sensors. Later on, we extend the results to heterogeneous sensors and propose a robust scheduling design when we have traffic and channel uncertainty. We propose three sensing strategies, and, within each one of them, several solutions, striking a balance between throughput performance and computational complexity, are proposed. In addition, we show that a sequential channel sensing strategy is the one to be preferred when the sensing time is small, the number of channels is large, and the number of users is small. For all the other cases, a parallel channel sensing strategy is recommended in terms of throughput performance. We also show that a proposed hybrid sequential-parallel channel sensing strategy achieves the best performance in all scenarios at the cost of extra memory and computation complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","volume":"15","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"16122706","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279151/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Scheduling Optimization in Multi-Channel Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1149981"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC","grantNumber":"STPG365205"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003150","fundingName":"FQRNT-CREER","grantNumber":"179776"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Scheduling Optimization in Multi-Channel Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-liu-2456885-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120242S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7503130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7503130","articleId":"7279151","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7279153,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Yong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Yong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085418258"},{"name":"Pham Xuan Trung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Dong-A University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Pham Xuan","lastName":"Trung","id":"38179809900"},{"name":"Jong-Wook Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Dong-A University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Wook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068756900"},{"name":"Yong-Jae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Jae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293253800"},{"name":"Sang-Yong Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Yong","lastName":"Jung","id":"37335318600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7279153","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Torque","Reflective binary codes","Brushless DC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","electric machines","finite element analysis","Gray codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["search region management","local search algorithm","brushless DC motor","optimal design","electric machines","computation time","finite-element analysis","FEA","guided random bit generation","Gray code","region selection","electric machine design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design Optimization","Electric Machines","Finite Element Analysis","Torque"]},{"kwd":["Design optimization","electric machines","finite-element analysis (FEA)","torque"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279153","abstract":"The optimal design of electric machines requires a significant amount of computation time, since the design is usually performed based on finite-element analysis (FEA) for better accuracy.

The local search algorithm does not guarantee that the global optimum solution can be searched effectively. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the novel optimization method, search region management (SRM), to improve the efficiency of the local search algorithm. SRM uses a guided random bit generation based on Gray code for the region selection when the local search iterates the optimum search process for a multi-start. In addition, the SRM saves and manages the information of previous searched points to prevent overlapping calculation and to increase the effectiveness of the local search during every iteration process. To clarify the effectiveness of the proposed method for electric machine design, it is applied to the optimal design of brushless dc motor coupled with FEA minimizing torque ripple.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2482966","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7410156/07279153.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2482966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Search Region Management Method for Local Search Algorithm Employing Design Optimization of Brushless DC Motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Search Region Management Method for Local Search Algorithm Employing Design Optimization of Brushless DC Motor","volume":"52","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15786625","publicationDate":"March 2016","externalId":"8200606","htmlLink":"/document/7279153/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Search Region Management Method for Local Search Algorithm Employing Design Optimization of Brushless DC Motor","sourcePdf":"tmag-jung-2482966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075945S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7410156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7410156","articleId":"7279153","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279156,"authors":[{"name":"Holger R.

State-of-the-art methods often show high sensitivities at the cost of high false-positives (FP) per patient rates. We design a two-tiered coarse-to-fine cascade framework that first operates a candidate generation system at sensitivities ~ 100% of but at high FP levels. By leveraging existing CADe systems, coordinates of regions or volumes of interest (ROI or VOI) are generated and function as input for a second tier, which is our focus in this study. In this second stage, we generate 2D (two-dimensional) or 2.5D views via sampling through scale transformations, random translations and rotations. These random views are used to train deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) classifiers. In testing, the ConvNets assign class (e.g., lesion, pathology) probabilities for a new set of random views that are then averaged to compute a final per-candidate classification probability. This second tier behaves as a highly selective process to reject difficult false positives while preserving high sensitivities. The methods are evaluated on three data sets: 59 patients for sclerotic metastasis detection, 176 patients for lymph node detection, and 1,186 patients for colonic polyp detection.

The proposed BSSFCL includes a rectifier bridge with a reactor. This reactor is used as a dc reactor in normal operation mode and as an ac reactor in fault conditions. The advantages of the proposed BSSFCL over the existing dc reactor-type FCLs are its negligible impedance in normal operation mode and its high impedance during a fault interval using simple and novel switching. In other words, during the normal operation mode, the proposed BSSFCL operates in dc mode and in the fault interval, its topology is changed to the ac mode. This switching decreases the switching transient recovery voltage and introduces considerable impedance during the fault period. MATLAB/Simulink software is used for simulations and a prototype is designed and tested for results verification, and to show the performance of the proposed BSSFCL.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7389461/07279159.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2477106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2477106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7389461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bridge-Type Solid-State Fault Current Limiter Based on AC/DC Reactor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Circuit faults","Fault currents","Switches","Bridge circuits","Resistance","Power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","fault current limiters","rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge-type solid-state fault current limiter","BSSFCL","AC-DC reactor","one series reactor","ac mode","dc mode","rectifier bridge","dc reactor","ac reactor","fault conditions","switching transient recovery voltage","Matlab-Simulink software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bridge-type solid-state fault current limiter","point of common coupling","series reactor","switching overvoltage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bridge-Type Solid-State Fault Current Limiter Based on AC/DC Reactor","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7279159/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15722260","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridge-Type Solid-State Fault Current Limiter Based on AC/DC Reactor","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-radmanesh-2477106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09009S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7389461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7389461","articleId":"7279159","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279161,"authors":[{"name":"Tomaso Erseghe","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e1 di Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6884276/7331740/7279161/erseg-2483321-small.gif","p":["Tomaso Erseghe was born in 1972.

It is also shown to be fast and accurate, providing a performance, which is equivalent to that of a centralized solver.

Bounds on performance of the joint system are measured in terms of data information rate for communications and a novel radar estimation information rate for the radar.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2483485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7358222/07279172.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2483485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inner Bounds on Performance of Radar and Communications Co-Existence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279172","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7358222/7279172-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Inner Bounds on Performance of Radar and Communications Co-Existence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279172/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15663182","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279172/","volume":"64","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000005","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Defense"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Inner Bounds on Performance of Radar and Communications Co-Existence","sourcePdf":"tsp-chiriyath-2483485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093468S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7358222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"7358222","articleId":"7279172","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7279186,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiguang Deng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7511818/7279186/deng-2482980-small.gif","p":["Shuiguang Deng received the BS and PhD degrees in computer science\n from Zhejiang University in 2002 and 2007, respectively.

With the development of cloud computing and web technologies, service mashups are becoming more and more widely used and a large number of mashup platforms have been produced. However, due to the proliferation of services on the web, how to select component services to create mashups has become a challenging issue. Most developers pay more attention to the quality of service (QoS) and cost of services. Beside service selection, mashup deployment is another pivotal process, as the platform can significantly affect the quality of mashups. In this paper, we focus on creating service mashups from the perspective of developers. A genetic algorithm-based method, genetic algorithm for mashup creation (GA4MC), is proposed to select component services and deployment platforms in order to create service mashups with optimal cost performance. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of GA4MC. The results show that the GA4MC method can achieve mashups whose cost performance is extremely close to the optimal. Moreover, the execution time of GA4MC is in a low order of magnitude and the algorithm performs good scalability as the experimental scale increases.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2015.2482980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7511818/07279186.pdf","startPage":"2234","endPage":"2247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2015.2482980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7511818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost Performance Driven Service Mashup: A Developer Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279186/","displayDocTitle":"Cost Performance Driven Service Mashup: A Developer Perspective","volume":"27","issue":"8","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16139257","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279186/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61170033"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Plan of China","grantNumber":"2014BAD10B02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost Performance Driven Service Mashup: A Developer Perspective","sourcePdf":"tpds-deng-2482980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128222S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7511818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7511818","articleId":"7279186","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7279187,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7514302/7279187/wang-2476491-small.gif","p":["Jin-Liang Wang received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2014.","In 2014, he joined the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, China.

The three models differ by the number of states (two, six, and ten) and, therefore, are suitable for different applications based on the required accuracy. The 2nd- and 6th-order models ignore dynamics of the second harmonics and circulating current suppression control (CCSC). The main challenges of dynamic analytical modelling of MMC are the nonlinear multiplication terms in ABC frame equations for modulating oscillating signals. The multiplication nonlinear terms are therefore considered directly in the rotating DQ frame. This requires simultaneous modeling in zero sequence, fundamental frequency DQ and double fundamental frequency DQ2 frames. The proposed linear analytical models are implemented in state space in MATLAB. The validity and accuracy of the models are verified against a detailed 401-level MMC model in PSCAD/EMTDC in both time and frequency domains. The results show very good accuracy for the 10th-order model and decreasing accuracy for the lower order models.

The proposed detector uses minimum mean square error (MMSE) sorted QR decomposition (MMSE-SQRD) to produce channel preprocessing result, which is realized by a modified systolic array architecture with concurrent sorting. Moreover, the adopted square-root MMSE algorithm for closed-loop reuses MMSE-SQRD preprocessing to largely save hardware overhead. In addition, an optimized K-Best detection algorithm is proposed for open-loop, which increases throughput by odd-even parallel sorting and produces high quality soft-output with discarded paths (DPs). A flexible VLSI architecture is designed for the proposed dual-mode detector, which supports 1\u00d71 ~ 4\u00d74 antennas and BPSK ~ 64-QAM modulation configuration. Implemented in SMIC 65 nm CMOS technology, the detector is capable of running at 550 MHz, which has a maximum throughput of 2.64 Gb/s for K-Best detection and 3.3 Gb/s for linear MMSE detection. The proposed detector is competitive to recent published works and meets the data-rate requirement of the EUHT standard.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"62","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15568143","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7279190/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Flexible Dual-Mode Soft-Output MIMO Detector With Channel Preprocessing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"No. 61306026"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Flexible Dual-Mode Soft-Output MIMO Detector With Channel Preprocessing","sourcePdf":"tcsi-yan-2479055-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103086S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7307240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7307240","articleId":"7279190","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7279195,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Zhang","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7279195/zhang-2482479-small.gif","p":["Dan Zhang received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004, and both the M.Sc. and Dr.-Ing. degrees in electrical engineering and information technology from RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

To evaluate its performance, its capacity limits are of particular importance. Therefore, this paper analyzes its constellation-constrained capacities for cases where the channel state information (CSI) is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver. In frequency selective channels, GFDM may provide advantage over the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme. In order to achieve near-capacity performance, the interaction of data symbols in time and frequency combined with multiple antennas (MIMO) challenges the design of GFDM receivers. This paper, therefore, applies expectation propagation (EP) for systematic receiver design. It is shown that the resulting iterative MIMO-GFDM receiver with affordable complexity can approach optimum decoding performance and outperform MIMO-OFDM in a rich multipath environment. Simulations are also used to illustrate the impact of channel delay spread on the constellation-constrained capacities and on the performance of the novel receiver algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2482479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07279195.pdf","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2482479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expectation Propagation for Near-Optimum Detection of MIMO-GFDM Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Expectation Propagation for Near-Optimum Detection of MIMO-GFDM Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279195/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15785871","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279195/","volume":"15","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicacoes"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico"},{"fundingName":"European Union FP7","grantNumber":"RESCUE ICT-619555"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expectation Propagation for Near-Optimum Detection of MIMO-GFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"twc-zhang-2482479-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123295S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7279195","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7279196,"authors":[{"name":"Gilwon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7279196/gilee-2483493-small.gif","p":["Gilwon Lee (S\u201910) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

It is shown that under the UR-SP channel model, RBF achieves linear sum rate scaling with respect to (w.r.t.) the number of transmit antennas and, furthermore, yields optimal sum rate performance when the number of transmit antennas is large, if the number of users increases linearly w.r.t. the number of transmit antennas. Several beam training and user selection methods are investigated to yield insights into the most effective beamforming and scheduling choice for mm-wave MU-MISO in various operating conditions. Simulation results validate our analysis based on asymptotic techniques for finite cases.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2483493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2483493","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07279196.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomly-Directional Beamforming in Millimeter-Wave Multiuser MISO Downlink","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Randomly-Directional Beamforming in Millimeter-Wave Multiuser MISO Downlink","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15785872","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7279196/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2013R1A1A2A10060852"},{"fundingName":"The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, Korea","grantNumber":"GK14N0100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomly-Directional Beamforming in Millimeter-Wave Multiuser MISO Downlink","sourcePdf":"twc-sung-2483493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163137S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7279196","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7279203,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Sheng Lang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7569115/7279203/lang-2483199-small.gif","p":["Hung-Sheng Lang received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2013.","He is currently an Engineer with Foxconn, New Taipei City, Taiwan.

Our objective is to maximize the sum rate (over subcarriers) of the cognitive-radio user with the interference introduced to the primary users (PUs) being managed. The optimization is over subcarrier pairing and power allocation, which leads to a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. To resolve this complicated MIP problem at a reasonable cost, we adopt the heterogeneous genetic algorithm (HGA) framework. The main motivation for the HGA framework comes from the idea that it can reduce the impact of extra assumptions made in previous works to simplify the problem. In our HGA, the chromosome is divided into an integer string for subcarrier pairing and a real-number string for power allocation. Two new initialization methods of these chromosomes, which are motivated by the convex optimization theory, are proposed. New crossover and mutation schemes are also devised to accommodate these new chromosomes, as well as to manage the interference to the PUs. Furthermore, we also propose a two-stage low-complexity genetic algorithm, which separately determines the proper subcarrier pairs and power allocations. Our simulations show that our HGAs and the two-stage algorithm provide competing performance, compared with similar state-of-the-art works.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2483199","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07279203.pdf","startPage":"7051","endPage":"7063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2483199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Pairing and Power Allocation With Interference Management in Cognitive Relay Networks Based on Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier Pairing and Power Allocation With Interference Management in Cognitive Relay Networks Based on Genetic Algorithms","volume":"65","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","accessionNumber":"16306005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7279203/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 104-2221-E-011-048 and MOST 104-2628-E-011-008-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier Pairing and Power Allocation With Interference Management in Cognitive Relay Networks Based on Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tvt-lin-2483199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13968S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7279203","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7279204,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Ma","affiliation":["Southeast University, State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085674984"},{"name":"Jianyi Zhou","affiliation":["Southeast University, State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianyi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291307800"},{"name":"Weichen Huang","affiliation":["Southeast University, State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weichen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085387842"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7279204","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":990},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, a systematic method to design compact output matching network of power amplifier (PA) is proposed, which is based on the simplified real frequency technique.

Supported by the concept of center of inertia (COI) in power systems, the PP theory is employed to model the wide-area coherency detection as an optimization problem. In the proposed method, the optimal projection direction in high dimensional orthogonal space is explored in order to detect the coherent groups via the data from synchronous phasor measurement units (PMUs). Two quantitative indices constructed with projection assessment index (PI), the objective of the optimization model, are then defined in order to determine the critical coherent group and the dominant coherent groups. The coherency detection criterion and the implementation framework for the proposed approach are also presented. Simulation data from the 16-machine 68-bus test system and China Southern power Grid (CSG), along with actual field-measurement data retrieved from WAMS database in the CSG, are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm under different disturbances. It is shown that the proposed methodology successfully detects the dominant coherent groups of generators and buses in bulk power system via the wide-area field-measurement data.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2475401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7463573/07279216.pdf","startPage":"2776","endPage":"2786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7463573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2475401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Projection Pursuit: A General Methodology of Wide-Area Coherency Detection in Bulk Power Grid","volume":"31","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279216/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15985739","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279216/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"51277128 and 51377117"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection Pursuit: A General Methodology of Wide-Area Coherency Detection in Bulk Power Grid","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-jia-2475401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091692S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7463573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7463573","articleId":"7279216","onlineDate":"28 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7279290,"authors":[{"name":"Rusheng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems and Decision, Wenzhou University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Rusheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085737577"},{"name":"Wenhai Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems and Decision, Wenzhou University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Wenhai","lastName":"Chen","id":"38007151100"},{"name":"Lixin Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems and Decision, Wenzhou University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37274360500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279290","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-agent systems","Protocols","Topology","Symmetric matrices","Linear matrix inequalities","Laplace equations","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","multi-agent systems","sampled data systems","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed consensus problem","general linear multiagent systems","consensus control problem","general continuous-time linear systems","interaction topology","distributed sampled-data based consensus protocol","linear matrix inequalities","LMIs","feedback gain matrix","low order consensus condition","gain matrix design approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-agent system","Consensus","Distributed control","Sampled-data","LMIs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279290","abstract":"This paper studies consensus control problem of multi-agent systems with sampled-data.

The performance of channel estimation varies with different pilot patterns (i.e. the number and allocation of pilots). According to the Nyquist's Theory, the number of pilot is obtained by the channel parameters. Based on the rule of cross-correlation, the number of multipath and the maximal time delay can be deduced. However, with the same number of pilots, different pilot allocation can impact the estimated result greatly. This paper aims at exploiting an optimal pilot allocation pattern for OFDM system. Different from the existing pilot patterns, this paper proposes a diagonal pilot allocation pattern, which is optimal in the frequency selective channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is superior to the equal-space pilot allocation pattern, and it can improve the spectral efficiency more than the 802.11 protocol does by a bit loss of performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation based on diagonal pilot in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279293","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279293.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation based on diagonal pilot in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279293/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15504673","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation based on diagonal pilot in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062259S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7279297,"authors":[{"name":"Yingchi Mao","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yingchi","lastName":"Mao","id":"37652026800"},{"name":"Haishi Zhong","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Haishi","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085689948"},{"name":"Xiaofang Li","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Engineering, Changzhou Institute of Technology, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085618255"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279297","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical model-based associate tasks scheduling with the deadline constraints in the cloud","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithms","Scheduling","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Delays","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","graph theory","grid computing","parallel processing","quality of service","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical model-based associate task scheduling","deadline constraints","cloud computing","dynamic virtualized resources","elastic virtualized resources","distributed computing","parallel computing","grid computing","QoS constraints","subDAG","hierarchical task graph","task execution concurrency","delay-bound constraint","task hierarchical model","SAH-DB algorithms","resource utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","dependent task scheduling","hierarchical task model","DAG","deadline constraint"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279297","abstract":"Cloud computing can provide the dynamic and elastic virtualized resources for the users and is based on distributed computing, parallel computing and grid computing.

The schedule constraint is based on the QoS constraints, such as task executed time, cost, resource utilization, etc. We proposed one task hierarchical model for the associated task scheduling considering the real application requirements in cloud computing. Considering the parallel structure of sub-DAG, we proposed the hierarchical task graph to decompose the associated tasks, which can improve the tasks execution concurrency and reduce the execution cost. In order to execute all of the associated tasks in the specific delay-bound, we proposed the concept of tasks processing capacity and the corresponding calculation method, and further established the mapping between the task processing capacity and execution time. Concerning the delay of the associated tasks scheduling in cloud computing, the associated task scheduling algorithms based on delay-bound constraint based on the task hierarchical model was proposed. The scheduling algorithm is called associated tasks scheduling based on serial/parallel structure (SAH-DB). Extensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SAH-DB algorithms can achieve better performance than CPM and TS-Sim algorithm in the terms of the total execution cost and resource utilization.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279297","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","startPage":"268","endPage":"273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical model-based associate tasks scheduling with the deadline constraints in the cloud","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279297/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15504434","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical model-based associate tasks scheduling with the deadline constraints in the cloud","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048449S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7279368,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Wang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085398253"},{"name":"Huiwen Guo","affiliation":["Key Lab of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Huiwen","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085339015"},{"name":"XinYu Wu","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin NT, Hong Kong, SAR, China","Key Lab of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"XinYu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293518700"},{"name":"Jinke Li","affiliation":["Key Lab of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Jinke","lastName":"Li","id":"37085682909"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279368","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel method based on Phase Spectrum of Quaternion Fourier Transform (PQFT) for anomaly detection in crowd is presented.

In this paper, we refer to the activities of crowd in far-field scenes. Firstly, we present a model for learning all of the motion patterns under single camera view, which are regarded as the normal situation. In the surveillance region, we mark the entrances and exits under the single camera view and acquire the crowd flow model by the K-means clustering algorithm. Secondly, we analyze the crowd flow model based on the time delayed statistical data between two camera views. And then we acquire the relative location among the entrances and exits in the different regions. Thirdly, we analyze the crowd transferring probabilistic model on the global scene based on the log-likelihood function and Dirichlet distribution to detect the crowd anomaly.

Based on the identification results, an indirect adaptive control scheme using singular perturbation theory is developed. By using singular perturbation theory, the system order is reduced, and the controller structure is simplified. The upper bound \u03b5* for the small parameter \u03b5 is also obtained, such that for all 0 <; \u03b5 <; \u03b5*, the estimated tracking errors will converge to 0 exponentially, and the tracking error will be bounded. The closed-loop stability is analyzed and the effectiveness of the identification and control scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279475","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1239","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279475.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and control for singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ellipsoids","Artificial neural networks","Adaptation models","Nonlinear systems","Adaptive control","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","continuous time systems","identification","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","recurrent neural nets","singularly perturbed systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["singular perturbation theories","system model parameters","adaptive identification method","singularly perturbed nonlinear system","multitime-scale recurrent high-order neural networks","optimal bounded ellipsoid concept","weight updating law","weights tuning","continuous time neural networks","identification process","indirect adaptive control scheme","controller structure","upper bound","tracking error","closed-loop stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent high-order neural network","singularly perturbed system","multi-time-scale system","optimal bounded ellipsoid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Identification and control for singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279475/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15504355","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and control for singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural networks","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104624S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7279489,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086206166"},{"name":"Deyun Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China"],"firstName":"Deyun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37403107700"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086429703"},{"name":"Qian Pan","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085538554"},{"name":"Kun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Shaanxi, Xi 'an, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37877580900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279489","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279489","abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive PID control for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control system with uncertain nonlinear dynamics.

new-generation motion device in modern precision industry while its advanced motion controller design is still of main concern. In this paper, a learning adaptive robust control (LARC) motion controller is proposed for a developed magnetically levitated planar motor to achieve good tracking performance. The planar motor consists of a Halbach permanent magnetic array as the stator, and a levitated platen containing four groups of three-phase windings as the mover. Based on the Lorentz force law, the mover placed in the magnetic field is subject to vertical force for levitation and horizonal force for planar motion through dynamics decoupling and current allocation. A LARC control scheme including iterative learning term and adaptive model compensation term in a parallel structure, is then proposed for the magnetically levitated planar motor to meet the challenge of high-performance tracking even under parametric uncertainty. Comparative experiments are carried out on the planar motor to track point-to-point and planar circular motions, respectively. The results consistently validate that the proposed LARC control strategy achieves good tracking performance even with payload. The proposed scheme actually provide a practically effective technique and a guidance for motion control of magnetically levitated planar motors in industrial applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279498","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279498.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precision LARC motion controller design for a magnetically levitated planar motor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precision LARC motion controller design for a magnetically levitated planar motor","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279498/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15504324","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7279498/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision LARC motion controller design for a magnetically levitated planar motor","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068665S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7279505,"authors":[{"name":"Songmin Jia","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Engineering Research Center of Digital Community, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Songmin","lastName":"Jia","id":"37082916500"},{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Henan Institute of Science and Technology, Xinxiang, China","College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Engineering Research Center of Digital Community, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085622021"},{"name":"Zhengyin Dong","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Engineering Research Center of Digital Community, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyin","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085729309"},{"name":"Xiuzhi Li","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Engineering Research Center of Digital Community, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiuzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37539522600"},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Engineering Research Center of Digital Community, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085676858"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279505","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279505","abstract":"Visual object tracking is a fundamental research topic in computer vision. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid tracking method based on Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Most modern trackers may be inaccurate when the training samples are imprecise which causes drift. To resolve these problems, MIL method is introduced into the tracking task, which can alleviate drift to some extent. However, the MIL tracker may detect the positive sample that is less important. PCNN is different from traditional artificial neural networks, which can be applied in many image processing fields, such as image segmentation. So, the PCNN was employed as sample detector which can know the most important sample when training the classifier. Then, a more robust and much faster tracker is proposed to approximately maximize the bag likelihood function. Empirical results on a large set of sequences demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in robustness, stability and efficiency to state-of-the-art methods in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279505","startPage":"1397","endPage":"1402","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279505.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new hybrid tracking strategy based on Pulse Coupled Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Neurons","Visualization","Object tracking","Image segmentation","Computer vision","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid tracking strategy","pulse coupled neural network","visual object tracking","computer vision","PCNN","multiple instance learning","MIL","image segmentation","sample detector","bag likelihood function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid tracking strategy","Multiple Instance Learning","PCNN","sliding window","image segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A new hybrid tracking strategy based on Pulse Coupled Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279505/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15504830","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new hybrid tracking strategy based on Pulse Coupled Neural Network","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065448S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7279535,"authors":[{"name":"Guohui Tian","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China"],"firstName":"Guohui","lastName":"Tian","id":"37530412300"},{"name":"Huanzhao Chen","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China"],"firstName":"Huanzhao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085712081"},{"name":"Fei Lu","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Lu","id":"38559929600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279535","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing platform based on intelligent space for service robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279535","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Robot kinematics","Service robots","Cloud computing","Libraries","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","control engineering computing","intelligent robots","knowledge acquisition","service robots","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing platform","service robot","intelligent space","robotic algorithms","sensor dates","knowledge extraction","information extraction","storage modules","knowledge library"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud robotics","Computing platform","Intelligent space","Micro cloud layer"]}],"abstract":"In order to develop a cloud computing platform which provides a compute cluster built with commodity hardware exposing some robotic algorithms and share data co-operatively across the robotic ecosystem.

In this new mechanism, each of the dictionary matrix element was first extended by adopting Taylor expansion to an arbitrary precise off-grid point, instead of only the points in a discrete form. Then by adding the new generated information into the dictionary matrix adaptively, an updated time-varying new dictionary matrix is yielded. Finally, in order to overcome the local minima in the traditional CS theory, a weighted PSO dynamic optimal method is adopted, where the convergence speed is increased due to the weighted factor introduced in the PSO. It is not necessary to know exactly the target parameters when using our approach, instead, coarse coding bounds of target parameters are enough for the algorithm, which can be done once and for all off-line, and it is only necessary to specify the initial scopes of the velocity and the range of the target. The proposed weighted PSO based waveform design approach has the potential to achieve much higher estimation accuracy, a faster convergence speed and robustness against unpredictable perturbations for range, a high precision in randomized step frequency radar.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279571","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279571.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","startPage":"1751","endPage":"1756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive compressed sensing based randomized step frequency radar with a weighted PSO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive compressed sensing based randomized step frequency radar with a weighted PSO","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279571/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15504799","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7279571/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive compressed sensing based randomized step frequency radar with a weighted PSO","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048795S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7279584,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Cao","affiliation":["Laboratory of Underwater Vehicles and Intelligent Systems, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37071335700"},{"name":"Zongrui Huang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Underwater Vehicles and Intelligent Systems, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zongrui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085612349"},{"name":"Daqi Zhu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Underwater Vehicles and Intelligent Systems, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Daqi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37273232500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279584","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"abstract":"Cooperative hunting is a challenging and critical issue in multi-AUV system research.

Firstly, based on the establishment of bio-inspired neural network model, AUV working environment is represent by it, there is one-to-one correspondence between each neuron in neural network and the position of the grid map of underwater environment. Then the activity values of biological neurons guide the AUV's sailing path and finally the target is surrounded by AUVs.

time-varying delay and unknown backlash-like hysteresis. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to approximate the unknown nolinear function term of the uncertain MIMO robotic systems and the unknown backlash-like hysteresis nonlinearity. To compensate the time-varying delays and unknown backlash-like hysteresis, a new version of high dimensional integral Lyapunov function is presented to construct a Lyapunov-based adaptive control structure. By combining the high dimensional integral-type Lyapunov function and RBFNN, the global stability of the considered systems is ensured and the tracking errors converge to the origin. Simulation studies on 2-DOF robotic manipulators demonstrate the proposed method is effective.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279585","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","startPage":"1827","endPage":"1832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive neural network control for uncertain MIMO robotic systems with time-varying delay and unknown backlash-like hysteresis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network control for uncertain MIMO robotic systems with time-varying delay and unknown backlash-like hysteresis","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279585/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15504401","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7279585/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network control for uncertain MIMO robotic systems with time-varying delay and unknown backlash-like hysteresis","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058662S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7279587,"authors":[{"name":"Difei Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Difei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085674957"},{"name":"Zhiyong Tang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Tang","id":"37594337600"},{"name":"Zhongcai Pei","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongcai","lastName":"Pei","id":"37592042000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279587","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Exoskeletons","Torque","Joints","Neural networks","Extremities","Noise measurement","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction","intelligent robots","mobile robots","motion control","neurocontrollers","robust control","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion control","lower extremity exoskeleton","RBF neural network identification","pilot motion intention","pilot wearing assistance exoskeleton","motion trajectories","human-machine system","simulation","robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exoskeleton","RBF neural network","system identification","interaction torque"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279587","abstract":"A lower extremity exoskeleton is designed and a novel control method based on RBF neural network identification is proposed to guarantee the exoskeleton identifies the pilot's motion intention independently. The propose method considers the pilot wearing assistance exoskeleton as an unknown system, and the RBF neural network is employed to identify the system's motion trajectories and the identification results are used as the exoskeleton's desired trajectories. The network's error function is obtained indirectly by the weighted summation of exoskeleton's tracking error and the interaction torque between pilot and exoskeleton. A human-machine system model including the elastic interaction torque is established according to the structural features of the designed one DOF exoskeleton, and then simulation is conducted based on it. The simulation results show the propose control method can identify the pilot's motion intention well and reduce the exoskeleton's drag torque acting on pilot dramatically. When dealing with the measurement noises, this method also shows good robustness. In addition, the exoskeleton can give pilot different tactile feedback through regulating the interaction torque's scale factor.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279587","startPage":"1838","endPage":"1842","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279587.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The motion control of lower extremity exoskeleton based on RBF neural network identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"The motion control of lower extremity exoskeleton based on RBF neural network identification","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279587/","accessionNumber":"15504399","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279587/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The motion control of lower extremity exoskeleton based on RBF neural network identification","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039669S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7279591,"authors":[{"name":"Kaide Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kaide","lastName":"Huang","id":"37072226500"},{"name":"Yubin Luo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yubin","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085710463"},{"name":"Xuemei Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37406274300"},{"name":"Guoli Wang","affiliation":["SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute, Foshan, China","School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guoli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37278828800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279591","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"abstract":"This work focuses on developing a data-efficient strategy for radio tomographic imaging with Bayesian compressive sensing.

Our main contribution is to incorporate the fade-level of links into the informative optimization paradigm to form our adaptive link selection strategy. The advantage of our approach is to exclude the uninformative links with high fading uncertainties due to the multipath components, which contributes to the data efficiency yet imaging performance enhancement.

We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the outputs at the intermediate layers of a CNN as image descriptors, in comparison with state-of-the-art image descriptors, in terms of their ability to match images for detecting loop closures. The main conclusions of our study include: (a) CNN-based image representations perform comparably to state-of-the-art hand-crafted competitors in environments without significant lighting change, (b) they outperform state-of-the-art competitors when lighting changes significantly, and (c) they are also significantly faster to extract than the state-of-the-art hand-crafted features even on a conventional CPU and are two orders of magnitude faster on an entry-level GPU.","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279659","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279659.pdf","startPage":"2238","endPage":"2245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural network-based image representation for visual loop closure detection","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15504362","htmlLink":"/document/7279659/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural network-based image representation for visual loop closure detection","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064387S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7279664,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwei Jia","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering and Automation College, XiHua University, Chengdu, China","Beijing Research Center of Intelligent Equipment for Agricultural, Beijing, China","Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forest Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiwei","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085687924"},{"name":"Quan Qiu","affiliation":["Beijing Research Center of Intelligent Equipment for Agricultural, Beijing, China","Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forest Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085680715"},{"name":"Junmin Li","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering and Automation College, XiHua University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Junmin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085684677"},{"name":"You Li","affiliation":["Beijing Research Center of Intelligent Equipment for Agricultural, Beijing, China","Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forest Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Li","id":"37085687784"},{"name":"Yue Cong","affiliation":["Beijing Research Center of Intelligent Equipment for Agricultural, Beijing, China","Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forest Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Cong","id":"37085608473"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279664","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279664","abstract":"This paper presents a new BP-neural-network-based localization algorithm for a wheeled agricultural mobile robot, which is front-wheel drive and differential steering.

neural network in decoupling research on flexible tactile sensors","abstract":"This paper proposes two decoupling methods for a flexible tactile sensor, improved back propagation neural network (BPNN) and radical basis function neural network (RBFNN). In the numerical experiments, the number of hidden layer nodes of the BPNN is optimized and k-fold-cross-validation (k-CV) method is also applied to construct the dataset. Information of the tactile sensor array at different scales is also used to construct the BPNN. RBFNN is applied to approach the nonlinear relationship between the deformation and the three-dimensional force of the tactile sensor numerical model built through finite element analysis. The decoupling results show that the RBFNN with high nonlinear approximation ability has good performance in decoupling three-dimensional force and satisfies both the decoupling accuracy and real-time requirements of the tactile sensor. Different white Gaussian noises (WGN) are added into the ideal model of the flexible tactile sensors. Then the modified RBFNN is applied to approximate and decouple the mapping relationship between row-column resistance with WGNs and the three-dimensional deformation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the improved RBFNN doesn't rely on the mathematical model of the system and has good anti-noise ability and robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279787/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15504456","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279787/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"BP and RBF neural network in decoupling research on flexible tactile sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BP and RBF neural network in decoupling research on flexible tactile sensors","confLoc":"Lijiang, China","sourcePdf":"0550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071754S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7267673","isNumber":"7279248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7267673","xplore-issue":"7279248","articleId":"7279787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7279788,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-xing Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunication Technology, China"],"firstName":"Fu-xing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088046327"},{"name":"Sheng-wang Xu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunication Technology, China"],"firstName":"Sheng-wang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088045696"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9104-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9103-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279788","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Rain fading","Rain","Satellite communication","Attenuation","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error correction codes","parity check codes","satellite communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance simulation","nonbinary LDPC codes","rain fade","Ka-band satellite communication","channel coding","advanced error correcting code","binary LDPC codes","gain 20 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ka-band Satellite communication","rain fade","Non-binary LDPC codes","coding gains"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279248","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance simulation of using non-binary LDPC codes to against rain fade in Ka-band","startPage":"2926","endPage":"2929","pdfPath":"/iel7/7267673/7279248/07279788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICInfA.2015.7279788","abstract":"Rain fade can lead to the deterioration of Ka-band Satellite communication performance, one of the efficient ways against rain fade is using channel coding with better performance.

Combined with a single loop PI controller, two different control methods are proposed based on the inverse model. One method is to take the output of the neural network inverse model as a feed forward, and superimpose it to the output of a single loop PI controller; another method is to cascade the neural network inverse model and its original model to form a pseudo linear system, and then adopt PI controller to perform single loop control.

Differently from model based control, data-driven control reduces the dependence of accurate mathematics model in process of controller designation. The key difficulty in fixed-wing UAV path following is that the model of UAV is generally underactuated and nonlinear, and easy to be affected by disturbances. The unique feature of this paper is that we explicitly employ data-driven control to design controller directly in two dimensions at constant height to overcome the drawback of dynamical uncertainties and wind disturbances.

This paper deals with the development of an energy efficient algorithm for optimal resources allocation at the data center using hybrid approach of the Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Genetic algorithm (GA) and Bin Packing techniques. The performance of the proposed hybrid approach is compared with Genetic Algorithm, DVFS with Bin Packing, DVFS without Bin Packing techniques.

Opportunistic Channel Access Scheme with Channel Ordering for Cognitive Radio Network","abstract":"Spectrum access by an unlicensed secondary user (SU) in a cognitive radio network (CRN) is challenging due to the dynamic nature of spectrum availability and possibility of collisions with the primary user (PU). SU uses a scheme where SU's packets are interleaved with periodic sensing to detect PU's return. To utilize spectrum efficiently, this paper proposes an opportunistic spectrum approach with channel ordering and periodic sensing. In the proposed approach, SU first selects a number of channels from ordered channels, senses them for opportunity, and then probes the idle channel for channel quality measurement. SU transmits over an idle channel, and the whole process is repeated for the SU transmissions. This paper presents a simple method for channel ordering, which reduces the channel access time. This scheme considers channel fading and channel availability for channel ordering and opportunity discovery.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279939/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15507764","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"4-6 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279939/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Opportunistic Channel Access Scheme with Channel Ordering for Cognitive Radio Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Opportunistic Channel Access Scheme with Channel Ordering for Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"1797a354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107477S","chronDate":"4-6 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7277333","isNumber":"7279856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7277333","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7279856","articleId":"7279939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7279941,"authors":[{"name":"Mrinal Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Mrinal","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085442445"},{"name":"Rajan Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Rajan","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085441591"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1797-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1796-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279941","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279941","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Communication systems","Wavelet transforms","Shift registers","Wavelet domain","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","binary sequences","error statistics","multi-access systems","pseudonoise codes","radio networks","random sequences","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error performance analysis","MAE","multiple access environment","communication channel","orthogonal basis function","binary pseudorandom sequence","LFSR","linear feedback shift register","pseudorandom code","wavelet domain communication system","transform domain communication system","DSA","bandwidth allocation Schemes","cordless service","dynamic spectrum access","WDCS","TDCS","PN phase generation","basis function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dyanamic Spectrum Access","TDCS","WDCS","LFSR","Pseudorandom Phase"]}],"abstract":"The ever increasing demand for cordless services has placed huge load on precious resources such as bandwidth.

In this paper, prime size DFTs are calculated using polynomial base WFFT and those are compared with conventional definition base algorithm in terms of arithmetic operations which drastically reduce area and increase speed. Theoretically, WFFT is very complex algorithm involving Chinese Remainder theorem(CRT) for polynomial calculations while for practical implementation it is one of the best optimize FFT algorithm. This paper includes prime size WFFT architectures, implemented in Verilog and simulated using Xilinx ISE 13.1.

The major drawback of the OFDM system is large Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) which can overweigh all the potential benefit of the OFDM system. Due to high PAPR, the power amplifier lead to saturation and generates inter modulation among the subcarriers. In this paper, we propose iterative clipping and filtering technique along with convolutional code that clipped the amplitude of the OFDM signal, which reduces the PAPR without much degradation in the bit error rate (BER). The reduction in amplitude variation by clipping creates distortion in the OFDM signal. Due to this distortion at the receiver end result higher BER. This BER performance is further improved by using convolutional code.

With its robustness to frequency selective fading, high spectral efficiency and ease of implementation by means of Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), OFDM is a cutting edge technology for Broadband mobile wireless. Along with its compatibility with MIMO, OFDM is an attractive air-interface solution to meet the demands of 4G networks. In mobile environment, channel is subject to both time and frequency selective fading. Although OFDM is resistant to ISI resulting from frequency selective fades, but it is quite sensitive to time selective multipath fading. This time selective fading causes ICI thus degrading system performance. For a satisfactory performance of OFDM, it is imperative that the sub-carriers remain orthogonal to each other. The orthogonal behaviour of sub-carriers can be jeopardised due to two effects namely Carrier frequency offset, and Doppler spread. In the case of high Doppler spread owing to high mobility, maintaining orthogonality between sub-carriers is a challenging task. To keep a SIR of 20 dB, OFDM symbol duration must not exceed 8% of the Coherence time of the channel. In the case of Carrier frequency offset, which is caused by the use of Local Oscillators, there is a frequency shift of the received signal spectrum. This frequency shift of the received signal spectrum compromises the orthogonality between the sub-carriers. This paper reviews the methods to mitigate the deleterious effect of time selective fading and compares the simulation result of high Doppler spread with that of small Doppler spread.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/7277333/7279856/07279953.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"424","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies","doi":"10.1109/CSNT.2015.107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNT.2015.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of OFDM in Time Selective Multipath Fading Channel in 4G Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Doppler effect","Fading","Time-frequency analysis","Wireless communication","Mobile communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","adjacent channel interference","discrete Fourier transforms","fading channels","intersymbol interference","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local oscillators","frequency shift","signal spectrum","coherence time","mobility","Doppler spread","carrier frequency offset","ICI","ISI","4G networks","air-interface solution","MIMO","broadband mobile wireless","cutting edge technology","DFT","discrete fourier transform","spectral efficiency","frequency selective fading","IEEE 802.11n WLAN","IEEE 802.16m WiMAX","3GPP LTE","Long Term Evolution","4G standards","4G systems","time selective multipath fading channel","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ICI","ISI","LTE","MIMO","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance of OFDM in Time Selective Multipath Fading Channel in 4G Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15507625","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","conferenceDate":"4-6 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of OFDM in Time Selective Multipath Fading Channel in 4G Systems","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"1797a421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076833S","chronDate":"4-6 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7277333","isNumber":"7279856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7277333","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7279856","articleId":"7279953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7279958,"authors":[{"name":"Prachi Tripathi","affiliation":["Harcourt Butler Technological Institute, Nawabganj, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Prachi","lastName":"Tripathi","id":"37085417603"},{"name":"Shivani Dixit","affiliation":["Harcourt Butler Technological Institute, Nawabganj, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Shivani","lastName":"Dixit","id":"37085414840"},{"name":"Roopali Agarwal","affiliation":["Harcourt Butler Technological Institute, Nawabganj, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Roopali","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37085413537"},{"name":"M.

This has resulted in digital image manipulations (also known as forgery and meddling) which alters the original image and hides or removes meaningful information and makes it tampered. All this is done with a malicious motivation to change the originality of image. Over the past decades a very promising field called as the field of digital forensics has emerged to help restore some trust to digital images. Restoring the traditional trustworthiness on digital photos plays prominent role as doctored photos are enhancing with growing frequency and sophistication these days .In this paper, we focus on image forensic detection on tampered pictures. The detection of a tampering in image is driven to provide authenticity and to maintain integrity of the image so that tampering is detected and minimized.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forgery","Digital images","Discrete wavelet transforms","Measurement","Forensics","Correlation coefficient","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital forensics","distortion","image enhancement","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forged features","image detection techniques","digital image processing","commercial image editing software","digital forensics","digital photos","doctored photos","image forensic detection","tampered pictures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forensic image","Authentication","Forgeries Detection Sensor","Noise Image forgeries","Copy-Move forgery detection","block matching","structure based tampering detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSNT.2015.286","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/7277333/7279856/07279982.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNT.2015.286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Forged Features Using Tampered and Inconsistent Image Detection Techniques in Digital Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Forged Features Using Tampered and Inconsistent Image Detection Techniques in Digital Image Processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279982/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279982/","accessionNumber":"15507798","conferenceDate":"4-6 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Forged Features Using Tampered and Inconsistent Image Detection Techniques in Digital Image Processing","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"1797a564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0466S","chronDate":"4-6 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7277333","isNumber":"7279856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7277333","xplore-issue":"7279856","articleId":"7279982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7279986,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Muttalib Khan","affiliation":["Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, IN"],"firstName":"Abdul Muttalib","lastName":"Khan"},{"name":"Shish Ahmad","affiliation":["CSE Department, Integral University, Lucknow, India"],"firstName":"Shish","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"38254077500"},{"name":"Mohd.

In this study, a data mining (DM) approach to predict the performance of P2P loan before funded is proposed. Using data from the Lending Club, we explore the characteristics of loan and its applicant and use random forest to do the feature selection in the modeling phase. The Difference from other risk prediction models is that the prediction is classified into three or four categories, rather than just two the default and not default classes. Then we compare five DM models: two decision trees (DTs), two neural networks (NNs) and one support vector machine (SVM) and use two metrics: average percent hit rate and area of the lift cumulative curve to evaluate the prediction results. The Empirical result shows that the term of loan, annual income, the amount of loan, debt-to-income ratio, credit grade and revolving line utilization play an important role in loan defaults. And SVM, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Multi-layer perceptron (MPL)'s prediction performance are almost equal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7279990/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15507690","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach to Predict Default Risk of Loan for Online Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Approach to Predict Default Risk of Loan for Online Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"1797a609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081098S","chronDate":"4-6 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7277333","isNumber":"7279856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7277333","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7279856","articleId":"7279990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7279993,"authors":[{"name":"Amee A.

A sensor node collects information about the physical environment. Now-a-days one main issue in wireless sensor network is wastage of energy at each sensor nodes. Energy is the one most important factor while considering sensor nodes. One new type of attack called vampire attack, which occurring at network layer. It leads to resource depletion (energy) at each sensor nodes, by reducing the battery power of any node. We propose method to mitigate this type of attack. This paper focuses on the goal of detection of vampire attack. The proposed method prevents the draining of life from network nodes. It works on the threshold energy of node. Thus, the problem of vampire attack can be reduced to some extent.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks","Routing protocols","Routing","Wireless communication","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","sensors nodes","energy wastage","vampire attack detection","resource depletion","battery power","threshold energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Network","Vampire Attack","Energy Consumption","Carousel Attack","Stretch Attack"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSNT.2015.94","publicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/7277333/7279856/07279993.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNT.2015.94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Proposal for Defending against Vampire Attack in WSN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Proposal for Defending against Vampire Attack in WSN","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7279993/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7279993/","accessionNumber":"15507814","conferenceDate":"4-6 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Proposal for Defending against Vampire Attack in WSN","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"1797a624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037199S","chronDate":"4-6 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7277333","isNumber":"7279856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7277333","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7279856","articleId":"7279993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7279996,"authors":[{"name":"Madhuri Rajawat","affiliation":["MPCT, Gwalior, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Madhuri","lastName":"Rajawat","id":"37085764424"},{"name":"D S Tomar","affiliation":["MPCT, Gwalior, M.P., India"],"firstName":"D S","lastName":"Tomar","id":"37706769700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1797-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1796-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7279996","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7279996","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","Digital images","Robustness","Conferences","Forgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","discrete wavelet transforms","image classification","image colour analysis","image watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RGB image secure watermarking technique","RGB image tampering detection technique","2 level DWT","digital watermarking method","image authentication","image security improvement","PSNR value","image classification","image application","image attacks","discrete wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital watermarking","Tampering detection","2-DWT."]}],"abstract":"Digital watermarking is a method of combining data into a digital signal. In digital watermarking we work on two images one is for watermark image, which is cover on the original image (secondary image) that gives security to the image. It acts as a digital mark, providing the image a good decision of ownership or authenticity. Digital watermarking method is very inspiring for image authentication or security for attacks. This paper presents digital watermarking for their classification, application, techniques, attacks and also tampering detection in digital watermarking. We proposed a new algorithm for digital watermarking and tampering detection technique, by combining these techniques, we can improve the security of image. We worked on RGB components such as red, green and blue for enhancing security and robustness. 2-DWT applied on RGB components for better results. In the tampering process, we used watermarked image as a reference image for detecting tampering.
