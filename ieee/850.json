It is common to use facial expressions to express emotions during a conversation. Moreover, some interpersonal communication can be achieved using facial expressions only. Some facial expressions are universal, they express the same emotion across cultures. If a machine were able to interpret its user's facial expression correctly, it might be able to help its user more efficiently. In this paper, a novel vectorized facial feature for facial expression will be introduced. The vectorized facial feature can be used to build an DNN (Deep Neural Network) for emotion recognition. Using the proposed vectorized facial feature, the DNN can predict emotions with 84.33% accuracy. Nevertheless, compared with CNNs (Convolutional Neural Network) with similar performance, training such DNN requires less time and data.","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500080.pdf","startPage":"0318","endPage":"0322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500080","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion Recognition Using Deep Neural Network with Vectorized Facial Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Emotion Recognition Using Deep Neural Network with Vectorized Facial Features","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500080/","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18168191","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion Recognition Using Deep Neural Network with Vectorized Facial Features","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053249S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8500080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500083,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassan Bilal","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ghassan","lastName":"Bilal","id":"37086014162"},{"name":"Haider Hashim","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Haider","lastName":"Hashim","id":"37086069850"},{"name":"Pablo Gomez","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Gomez","id":"37270718400"},{"name":"Ikhlas Abdel-Qader","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ikhlas","lastName":"Abdel-Qader","id":"38273767200"},{"name":"Ahmed Jalil Al-Bayati","affiliation":["Kimmel School of Construction Management, Western Carolina University, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed Jalil","lastName":"Al-Bayati","id":"37086488403"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5397-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5399-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"8500083","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arc discharges","Hazards","Injuries","Circuit faults","Urban areas","NFPA","Switchgear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arcs (electric)","hazards","safety systems","short-circuit currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NFPA safety standard","arc-flash labels","short-circuit fault analysis","arc flash accidents","public service facilities","arc flash assessment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arc flash","incident energy","NFPA 70E","EasyPower"]}],"abstract":"Arc flash accidents are one of the leading causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries in both construction and general industries.

With the NOMA design paradigm, different group of users are served by one orthogonal resource block. The resources implied here are either of time, frequencies or spreading code. In this paper, a combinatorial design for non-orthogonal multiple access is introduced. The design are based on structured designs called balanced incomplete block designs. The balanced characteristics of these designs scales to a large number of users and can be effectively used for multiuser detection in multi-access systems. The flexible design structure of the parameters allows robust designs as a rate-diversity tradeoff can be exploited. This design exploits channel state information therefore enabling simple design of optimum or sub-optimal receivers.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500099","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500099.pdf","startPage":"0851","endPage":"0855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOMA Decoding Based on Correlated Signal Set","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500099/","displayDocTitle":"NOMA Decoding Based on Correlated Signal Set","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18183542","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NOMA Decoding Based on Correlated Signal Set","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041688S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","articleId":"8500099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500100,"authors":[{"name":"Klaus-Tycho Foerster","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8727625/8500100/foers-2876749-small.gif","p":["Klaus-Tycho Foerster received the Diploma degrees in mathematics and computer science from the Braunschweig University of Technology, Germany, in 2007 and 2011, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from ETH Zurich, Switzerland, in 2016, advised by R.

Solution for this important problem based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are currently state-of-the-art. So far all CNNs used images of fixed size (typically 224\u00d7224 which commonly used in other fields of computer vision). In this paper, we propose a multi-scale deep CNN architecture that can accept variable image sizes. We achieve this by using multiple CNN, that share some or all parameters, followed by a merge layer, fully connected layers, and finally a softmax layer for classification. In each epoch we train the network with a batch of images of all scales. We have implemented this architecture using three SqueezeNet CNNs trained on three different scales of scene images. Then we carried out experiments on three well know datasets, namely TIC Merced, KSA, and AID datasets. Preliminary results show that this multi-scale CNN do converge just as the traditional single-scale training, and leads to better testing accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500107","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology

and direct-detection C-band optical transceiver capable of addressing all datacenter interconnect environments at well beyond 100 Gbaud. For this, the transmitter makes the use of two key InP technologies: a 2:1 double heterojunction bipolar transistor selector multiplexer and a monolithically integrated distributed-feedback laser traveling-wave electro-absorption modulator, both exceeding 100-GHz of 3-dB analog bandwidth. A preamplified 110-GHz PIN photodiode prior to a 100-GHz analog-to-digital converter complete the ultrahigh bandwidth transceiver module; the device under study. In the experimental work, which discriminates between intra- and inter-data center scenarios (dispersion unmanaged 120, 560, and 960 m; and dispersion-managed 10 and 80 km of standard single-mode fiber), we evaluate the bit-error rate evolution against the received optical power at 140, 180, and 204 Gbaud on-off keying for different equalization configurations (adaptive linear filter with and without the help of short-memory sequence estimation) and forward error correction schemes (hard-decision codes with 7% and 20% overhead); drawing conclusions from the observed system-level limitations of the respective environments at this ultrahigh baudrate, as well as from the operation margins and sensitivity metrics. From the demonstration, we highlight three results: successful operation with >6-dB sensitivity margin below the 7% error-correction at 140 Gbaud over the entire 100 m-80 km range with only linear feed-forward equalization. Then, the transmission of a 180-Gbaud on-off keying carrier over 80 km considering 20% error-correction overhead. Finally, a 10-km communication at 204 Gbaud on-off keying with up to 6 dB sensitivity margin, and regular 7% overhead error-correction.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

hurdles that hamper the conventional communication methods (wired and RF wireless). EMAT (Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer), an ultrasonic signal generation technique that generates different modes of waveform, is particularly useful for hot, cold, or dry environments, which overcome many of the issues faced by conventional PZT ultrasonic probes. In this paper, EMAT is used as the transmitter for noncontact ultrasonic signal generation and PZT is used as the receiver for the communication system. This system is designed to assess the efficiency of Lamb waves and to examine Bit Error Rate (BER) of digital communication. The communication system was configured using National Instrument arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and PXI digital oscilloscope. The accuracy of transmitted information is tested on a 5-foot long stainless-steel plate and pipe. The system operates with the frequency of 414 kHz signal and uses Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK) modulation for transmission. This method can transfer digital data in presence of undesirable multipath effect with bit rates of 20 kbps and 40 kbps without any error.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500148","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500148.pdf","startPage":"0379","endPage":"0383","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying EMAT for Ultrasonic Communication Through Steel Plates and Pipes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Applying EMAT for Ultrasonic Communication Through Steel Plates and Pipes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500148/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18183549","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500148/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying EMAT for Ultrasonic Communication Through Steel Plates and Pipes","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050427S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8482102","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8500077","articleId":"8500148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8500158,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Liu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8500158/liu-2876152-small.gif","p":["Miao Liu (GS\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.S. degree in communication and information engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2011.

However, considering the large numbers of connectivity demands, it is vital to improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of the IoT with an affordable power consumption. To improve the SE, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is newly proposed through accommodating multiple users in the same spectrums. As a result, in this paper, an energy efficient resource allocation (RA) problem is introduced for the NOMA-based heterogeneous IoT. At first, we assume the successive interference cancellation (SIC) is imperfect for practical implementations. Then, based on the analyzing method for cognitive radio networks, we present a stepwise RA scheme for the mobile users and the IoT users with the mutual interference management. Third, we propose a deep recurrent neural network-based algorithm to solve the problem optimally and rapidly. Moreover, a priorities and rate demands-based user scheduling method is supplemented, to coordinate the access of the heterogeneous users with the limited radio resource. At last, the simulation results verify that the deep learning-based scheme is able to provide optimal RA results for the NOMA heterogeneous IoT with fast convergence and low computational complexity. Compared with the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access system, the NOMA system with imperfect SIC yields better performance on the SE and the scale of connectivity, at the cost of high power consumption and low energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8709863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8709863/08500158.pdf","startPage":"2885","endPage":"2894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Cognitive Perspective: Resource Allocation for NOMA-Based Heterogeneous IoT With Imperfect SIC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep Cognitive Perspective: Resource Allocation for NOMA-Based Heterogeneous IoT With Imperfect SIC","volume":"6","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8500158/","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18654034","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500158/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012246","fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701258"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professor Program","grantNumber":"RK002STP16001"},{"fundingName":"Program for Jiangsu Six Top Talent","grantNumber":"XYDXX-010"},{"fundingName":"Program for High-Level Entrepreneurial and Innovative Talents Introduction","grantNumber":"CZ0010617002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20170906"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","grantNumber":"17KJB510044"},{"fundingName":"NUPTSF","grantNumber":"XK0010915026"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005374","fundingName":"Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Cognitive Perspective: Resource Allocation for NOMA-Based Heterogeneous IoT With Imperfect SIC","sourcePdf":"jiot-gui-2876152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106877S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8500158","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500159,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin Arunmozhi","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering, Kettering University, Flint, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Arunmozhi","id":"37086487348"},{"name":"Jungme Park","affiliation":["ECE, Kettering University, Flint, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Jungme","lastName":"Park","id":"37086488504"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5397-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5399-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"8500159","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"abstract":"Autonomous vehicles may be the most significant innovation in transportation since automobiles were first invented. Environmental perception plays a pivotal role in the development of self-driving vehicles which need to navigate in a complex environment of static and dynamic objects. It is required to extract dynamic objects like vehicles and pedestrians more precisely and robustly to estimate the current position, motion and predict its future position. In this article, the performance of three commonly used object detection approaches, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Haar-like features and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is investigated and analyzed using a public dataset of camera images. The detection results show that for the same dataset, LBP features perform better than the other two feature types with a higher detection rate. Finally, a unique and robust detection algorithm using a combination of all the three different feature descriptors and AdaBoost cascade classification is proposed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018

problem on the camera pose estimation from 2-D images. Given only 3 images of the same scene, one may apply the well-known fundamental matrix or trifocal tensor to make a robust computation of the poses among the three camera views. Practically, extracting the pose parameters from them is not straight forward. Multiple solutions arise and the final computed value may deviate from the actual one even if the closest solution is chosen since the process is highly nonlinear. In this paper, we are going to investigate the use of a machine learning approach to solve the problem. An artificial neural network is trained with noisy point features from three views to estimate the camera poses among them. It is found that the proposed method is able to compute accurate pose parameters under noisy environment. The effects of applying different amount of noises to the training and testing datasets have also been studied.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500160","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500160.pdf","startPage":"0027","endPage":"0031","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing the Relations Among Three Views Based on Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Computing the Relations Among Three Views Based on Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18192975","publicationDate":"May 2018","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing the Relations Among Three Views Based on Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040437S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","articleId":"8500160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500172,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Minh Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Photonics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Hong-Minh Nguyen is currently working toward the Ph.D.\u00a0degree\n with the Department of Photonics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan."]},"firstName":"Hong-Minh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37733893900"},{"name":"Chia-Chien Wei","affiliation":["Department of Photonics, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chia-Chien Wei received the Ph.D.\u00a0degrees in electro-optical\n engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, and in electrical engineering from the University of\n Maryland, Baltimore County, MD, USA, in 2008.","In 2011, he joined National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, where he is currently an Associate\n Professor with the Department of Photonics.

This scheme greatly increases tolerance to nonlinear distortion caused by the interaction between laser chirp and chromatic dispersion. Tuning the frequency gap between 2 to 5 GHz (in accordance with the transmission distance) makes it possible to mitigate a considerable proportion of dispersion-induced nonlinear distortion. Experiment results revealed that the proposed scheme can increase the achievable data rate by up to 136%, compared to conventional OFDM over 300 km of dispersion-uncompensated standard single mode fiber. Following transmission over more than 200 km, the proposed modulation scheme also outperforms conventional OFDM incorporating with a Volterra equalizer by up to 24%. We also conducted optimization of DML bias current and driving voltage. Our results show that operating at high bias and driving voltage can greatly improve data rates following the mitigation of distortion via gapped OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2876912","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8520944/08500172.pdf","startPage":"5617","endPage":"5625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2876912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Impact of Nonlinear Distortion in DML-Based OFDM Transmission by Frequency Gap","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500172/","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Impact of Nonlinear Distortion in DML-Based OFDM Transmission by Frequency Gap","volume":"36","issue":"23","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"18243423","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8500172/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Impact of Nonlinear Distortion in DML-Based OFDM Transmission by Frequency Gap","sourcePdf":"jlt-wei-2876912-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156761S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8520944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8520944","articleId":"8500172","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8500176,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086487588"},{"name":"Andress Jacoby","affiliation":["Continental Automotive Systems, Auburn Hills, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Andress","lastName":"Jacoby","id":"37086488360"},{"name":"Daniel Llamocca","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Llamocca","id":"37392136200"},{"name":"Brian Sangeorzan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Sangeorzan","id":"37086487420"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5397-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5399-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"8500176","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500176","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Hardware","Heat transfer","Estimation","Heating systems","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crankcases","embedded systems","engine cylinders","engines","fixed point arithmetic","floating point arithmetic","manifolds","pressure measurement","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manifold pressure","throttle position","engine speeds","64-bit floating-point software model","real-time estimation","hardware architecture","32-bit dual fixed-point arithmetic","crank-angle-resolved engine cylinder","pressure estimation","embedded system","automotive application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cylinder Pressure Estimation","Dual Fixed-Point Arithmetic","Reconfigurable Embedded Systems","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This work presents a custom hardware architecture for crank-angle-resolved engine cylinder pressure estimation that can accept inputs such as speed, manifold pressure and throttle position, and deliver cylinder pressure in real-time, at engine speeds covering the useful operating range of most engines (up to 10,000 rpm). The hardware, placed in a reconfigurable embedded system for real-time validation, was tested using results of a model derived from actual engine data (13 sets). The hardware, implemented in 32-bit Dual Fixed-Point arithmetic, exhibits results that are very close to those of a 64-bit floating-point software model.

The accuracy depends on many different aspects including physical conditions, surrounding environmental conditions, users' distinct features and other factors. In this paper, we investigate the enhacement possibility of IoT based health monitoring system by applying neural network. By training the collected user data from different types of medical emergency-related scenarios, the system would gain better accuracy over the traditional thresholding data analysis systems. In this study, we focus on applying neural network to the fall detection application which involves wireless wearable sensors with accelerometers and a gyroscope. We utilize multilayer perceptron neural network to train user movement datasets including positive falls (falling events) and negative falls (non-falling events). This system design approach has the potential to be extended to multi-purpose user activity and health monitoring system, including people who have potential in needs of medical attentions and daily activity tracking.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and

children. However, clinical interpretation and bone age analyses are time-consuming, labor intensive, and often subject to inter-observer variability. This advocates the need of a fully automated method for bone age assessment. We propose a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically assess the pediatric bone age from hand radiograph. Our network is specifically trained to place more attention to those bone age related regions in the X-ray images. Specifically, we first adopt the attention module to process all images and generate the coarse/fine attention maps as inputs for the regression network. Then, the regression CNN follows the supervision of the dynamic attention loss during training; thus, it can estimate the bone age of the hard (or \u201coutlier\u201d) images more accurately. The experimental results show that our method achieves an average discrepancy of 5.2-5.3 months between clinical and automatic bone age evaluations on two large datasets. In conclusion, we propose a fully automated deep learning solution to process X-ray images of the hand for bone age assessment, with the accuracy comparable to human experts but with much better efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18973550","pubMedId":"30346295","htmlLink":"/document/8500181/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2019","volume":"23","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Regression Convolutional Neural Network for Automated Pediatric Bone Age Assessment From Hand Radiograph","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004921","fundingName":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","grantNumber":"YG2017ZD08"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"81471733 and 61471390"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFC0107602"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"16410722400"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regression Convolutional Neural Network for Automated Pediatric Bone Age Assessment From Hand Radiograph","sourcePdf":"jbhi-ren-2876916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100914S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8824156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8824156","articleId":"8500181","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8500182,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Hussain","affiliation":["School of Information Security and Applied Computing, Eastern Michigan University"],"firstName":"Syed","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37086487250"},{"name":"Munther Abualkibash","affiliation":["School of Information Security and Applied Computing, Eastern Michigan University"],"firstName":"Munther","lastName":"Abualkibash","id":"37402579800"},{"name":"Samir Tout","affiliation":["School of Information Security and Applied Computing, Eastern Michigan University"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Tout","id":"37698277500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5397-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5399-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"8500182","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Traffic Sign Recognition Systems Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500182.pdf","startPage":"0570","endPage":"0573","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500182","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Visualization","Convolution","Task analysis","Autonomous vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic sign recognition systems","Fast Branch CNN model","convolutional neural networks model","classifier training","visual data classification","visual data detection","TSR","features extraction","biological mechanisms","time-sensitive condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tsr (Traffic Sign Recognition)","CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)","Detection","Classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500182","abstract":"In this paper, we briefly discuss the applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) model to traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems. Traditionally, the TSRs have used different techniques to detect and classify visual data. The CNN s have been used separately to extract features and train the classifier as well as simultaneously for detection and classification tasks. One model that has been successful is the Fast Branch CNN model, which imitates biological mechanisms to become more efficient. While it is not the most accurate of the ones presented in this paper, the efficiency it exhibits under time-sensitive conditions is worth exploring because of the potential applications of such technology. The Fast Branch CNN model challenged the assumptions of past models, and this technology can only advance further if new models attempt to do the same.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18168230","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Traffic Sign Recognition Systems Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Traffic Sign Recognition Systems Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046109S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8500182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500189,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Demba","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Clausthal University of Technology (TUC), Germany"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Demba","id":"37086487115"},{"name":"Dietmar P.

The main feature of V2V is that it does not rely on third party networks like cellular networks to communicate. Its ad hoc communication spans up to 1000 m with 360\u00b0 view of nearby vehicles. Despite the wide range of benefit that V2V offers, it still faces a number of challenges in deployment. Due to high rating by operators of V2V capabilities to solve road traffic critical safety, increase interest in this technology. This student research paper explores technologies, benefits, and challenges of V2V with solutions. It focuses on countering the challenges of control systems with more emphasis on security. In this context, the technology poses security issues with interference. Thus an enhanced architectural solution is suggested that could help to guarantee system operation without interference and more physical security. A standardized space on road vehicle should be created specifically for V2V components and system status application should be added. In this regard V2V is a vehicular ad hoc network designed for automobiles to talk to each other automatically, using a wireless ad hoc network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Technology","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500189","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500189.pdf","startPage":"0459","endPage":"0464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Technology","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18183552","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Technology","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029604S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8500189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500190,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Ching Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas"],"firstName":"Chung-Ching","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086307725"},{"name":"Ahmed Alzahmi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Alzahmi","id":"37086310403"},{"name":"Nahid Mirzaie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas"],"firstName":"Nahid","lastName":"Mirzaie","id":"37086310183"},{"name":"Gyung-Su Byun","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Gyung-Su","lastName":"Byun","id":"37429825000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5397-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5399-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"8500190","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","5G mobile communication","Gain","CMOS technology","Harmonic analysis","Microwave amplifiers","Microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","CMOS integrated circuits","distortion","integrated circuit design","microwave power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Darlington pair driver stage","power gain","pre-distortion power amplifier","Ku-Band/5G Applications","low complex pre-distortion circuit","millimeter wave band","size 130.0 nm","voltage 3.6 V","voltage 1.8 V","frequency 15.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power amplifier","millimeter wave","CMOS","5G communication","ku band","pre-distortion technique","Darlington pair"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500190","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500190.pdf","startPage":"0808","endPage":"0811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Pre-Distortion Power Amplifier for Ku-Band/5G Applications","abstract":"A 15 GHz power amplifier design for 5G applications is presented in this paper.

It is also an important indicator of the fetal status. However, extracting FECG from non-invasive sensors is not easy since the FECG signal is weak compared to the Maternal ECG (MECG) signal. In conventional signal processing methods, it requires an adaptive filter with the MECG signal and the mixture of Electrocardiography (ECG) signal to reveal the FECG signal. This procedure requires significant computation power and multiple sensors applied on the pregnant women. As machine learning algorithms become more and more popular, applying neural network to signal processing is widely adapted in all types of applications. This paper presents a method based on neural network to recognize the FECG signal from the abdominal ECG signal acquired by non-invasive sensors. Training and evaluation procedure are achieved in TensorFlow on a heterogeneous platform. This algorithm can precisely identify both MECG and FECG signal from the maternal abdominal ECG signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500232/","accessionNumber":"18168194","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fetal Electrocardiogram Recognition Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fetal Electrocardiogram Recognition Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042894S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","articleId":"8500232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8500234,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Kamalian","affiliation":["Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Kamalian","orcid":"0000-0002-6278-976X","id":"37085707244"},{"name":"Anastasiia Vasylchenkova","affiliation":["Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Anastasiia","lastName":"Vasylchenkova","id":"37086513643"},{"name":"Dmitry Shepelsky","affiliation":["V.

The burst mode requirement emerges due to the very nature of the commonly used version of the NFT processing method: it can process only rapidly decaying signals, requires zero-padding guard intervals for processing of dispersion-induced channel memory, and does not allow one to control the time-domain occupation well. Some of the limitations and drawbacks imposed by this approach can be rectified by the recently introduced more mathematically demanding periodic NFT processing tools. However, the studies incorporating the signals with cyclic prefix extension into the NFT transmission framework have so far lacked the efficient digital signal processing (DSP) method of synthesizing an optical signal, the shortcoming that diminishes the approach flexibility. In this paper, we introduce the Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) based DSP method as a flexible and expandable tool that would allow one to utilize the periodic NFT spectrum for transmission purposes without former restrictions. First, we outline the theoretical framework and clarify the implementation underlying the proposed new DSP method. Then we present the results of numerical modelling quantifying the performance of long-haul RHP-based transmission with the account of optical noise, demonstrating the good performance quality and potential of RHP-based optical communication systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Modulation and Processing in Nonlinear Fibre Channels by Employing the Riemann\u2013Hilbert Problem","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2877103","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8547159/08500234.pdf","startPage":"5714","endPage":"5727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2877103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8547159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","displayDocTitle":"Signal Modulation and Processing in Nonlinear Fibre Channels by Employing the Riemann\u2013Hilbert Problem","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/8500234/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"18284233","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000275","fundingName":"Leverhulme Trust","grantNumber":"RPG-2018-063"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/R035342/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Signal Modulation and Processing in Nonlinear Fibre Channels by Employing the Riemann\u2013Hilbert Problem","sourcePdf":"jlt-kamaliankopae-2877103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134112S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8547159","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8547159","articleId":"8500234","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8500242,"authors":[{"name":"M.

more. Today, Machine Learning applications are mainly driven by Cloud Computing, but a recent trend towards on-device ML execution is taken over. We can expect that in coming years there will be smart homes and buildings populated by much more smart devices able to assist human activities more naturally. We present a work in progress, a mobile edge computing prototype built to explore and validate how ready are smartphones for on-device execution of deep neural networks (DNNs) using as a test bed a light control of a smart classroom via object recognition using three pre-trained non-optimized DNN models embedded in one mobile app. The prototype was successfully accomplished for recognition and control tasks using only smartphone's CPU/GPU processing units to run DNN models under 670ms. Finally, on-device DNN inference performance is discussed and some future work issues are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18168257","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Smart Classrooms Aided by Deep Neural Networks Inference on Mobile Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Classrooms Aided by Deep Neural Networks Inference on Mobile Devices","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071068S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","citationCount":"5","articleId":"8500260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500261,"authors":[{"name":"Giribabu Sinnapolu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Giribabu","lastName":"Sinnapolu","id":"37086488028"},{"name":"Shadi Alawneh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Shadi","lastName":"Alawneh","id":"38196567700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5397-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5399-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"8500261","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Pattern matching","Kernel","Parallel processing","Software algorithms","Instruction sets","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","graphics processing units","parallel architectures","pattern matching","string matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU accelerated implementation","Sunday string pattern matching algorithm","compute cores","computer applications","Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms","Sunday string matching algorithm","Boyer-Moore algorithm","GPU implementation","serial CPU implementation","graphics processor units"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CUDA Steams","GPGPU","String matching","GPU","CPU"]}],"abstract":"In recent days, Graphics Processing Units (GPU's) have some specialized optimizations that have led to outperform traditional CPU's. General Purpose computing on Graphics Processor Units (GPGPU) brings massively parallel computing (hundreds of compute cores) to the desktop at a reasonable cost, but requires that algorithms be carefully designed to take advantage of this power. The present work explores the possibilities of using GPU's along with CUDA Streams to improve the performance of a string matching algorithm. String matching plays an important role in today's computer applications. Strings are an integral part of almost every data structure we manage. Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms are the most famous string matching algorithms that have been proved efficient to some extent using CPU's and GPU's. Sunday string matching algorithm is another version of Boyer-Moore algorithm. In this paper, we have used GPU's to accelerate the performance of the Sunday string matching algorithm. We have conducted experiments to measure the performance of the GPU implementation with respect to the serial CPU implementation. Our results show a speedup of up to 20 times compared to the sequential implementation on the CPU.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU Accelerated Implementation for Sunday String Pattern Matching Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500261","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500261.pdf","startPage":"0007","endPage":"0011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"GPU Accelerated Implementation for Sunday String Pattern Matching Algorithm","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18183529","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU Accelerated Implementation for Sunday String Pattern Matching Algorithm","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058652S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","articleId":"8500261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500266,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics and National Engineering Laboratory for Next Generation Internet Access System, School of Optics and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Hao Wu received the B.S. and M.

Denoising of Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analyzer With High Data Fidelity Using Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"In recent years, many conventional image denoising techniques have been intensively studied to enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of Brillouin optical time domain analyzer (BOTDA), due to their superior denoising performance to one-dimensional methods. However, in the case of low sampling rate, the details of the signal are smoothed out due to less useful information, resulting in a degradation of the spatial resolution. Moreover, these conventional denoising algorithms are quite time-consuming compared with the BOTDA measuring time. To overcome these drawbacks, we employ a feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNN) based image denoising for BOTDA. A conventional BOTDA system with 15 ns pulse width is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the exploited CNN-based denoising method. The actual electrical noise signals of the BOTDA at different sampling rates are collected to synthesize training samples. The CNN model is trained with the noise and simulated BOTDA signals. Experimental results show that SNR improvement of 13.43 dB, 13.57 dB, and 12.9 dB is achieved at a sampling rate of 500 MSa/s, 250 MSa/s, and 125 MSa/s, respectively, via the trained CNN denoiser. No spatial resolution distortion can be observed in the denoised BOTDA signals. Besides, the CNN denoiser only takes 0.045 s to process a 151 \u00d7 50000 image benefiting from GPU computing. This processing time is negligible compared with the acquisition time of BOTDA, which makes real-time denoising possible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1, 1 2019","publicationDate":"1 June1, 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8500266/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18636032","volume":"37","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Denoising of Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analyzer With High Data Fidelity Using Convolutional Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331010 and 61722108"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2016YXZD038"},{"fundingName":"Major Program of the Technical Innovation of Hubei Province of China","grantNumber":"2016AAA014"},{"fundingName":"Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber and Cable Manufacture Technology","grantNumber":"SKLD1706"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Denoising of Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analyzer With High Data Fidelity Using Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-tang-2876909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080773S","chronDate":"June1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8704341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8704341","articleId":"8500266","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500274,"authors":[{"name":"Mitch Campion","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND"],"firstName":"Mitch","lastName":"Campion","id":"37085795111"},{"name":"Prakash Ranganathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND"],"firstName":"Prakash","lastName":"Ranganathan","id":"37410520100"},{"name":"Saleh Faruque","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND"],"firstName":"Saleh","lastName":"Faruque","id":"37344546200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5397-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5399-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"8500274","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1086},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500274","abstract":"Removed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500274","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500274.pdf","startPage":"0903","endPage":"0908","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Removal: A Review and Future Directions of UAV Swarm Communication Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Removal: A Review and Future Directions of UAV Swarm Communication Architectures","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500274/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18168189","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreNote":"Document Removed From IEEE Xplore: Copyright permission was not provided for the material in this document, therefore the document has been removed from IEEE Xplore.

Our technique considers a wide range of long-term reliability issues and maximizes the throughput of the processor subject to the reliability constraint. We employ ON/OFF switching actions and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling as control knobs (i.e., working modes) to tune the state of cores of the processor. In order to achieve this, our technique detects program phases and adaptively determines the optimal working modes for each phase using the Q-learning-based method. By integrating the phase detection into the Q-learning-based management, our technique can provide efficient management for the programs with highly diverse phases. We also propose three additional modules to improve the management efficiency of our technique. In order to evaluate our technique, we use it to manage a 3-D CPU with high-diver programs. Several failure mechanisms are considered in this case study. Our proposed technique is compared with two existing Q-learning-based techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that when the number of phases is smaller than the number of working modes, our technique can achieve more than 1.36\u00d7 improvement in performance with 60% memory space savings.","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8877482/08500286.pdf","startPage":"2022","endPage":"2031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2877014","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2877014","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500286","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Reliability","Phase detection","Temperature sensors","Throughput","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","integrated circuit reliability","learning (artificial intelligence)","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","optimisation","power aware computing","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced phase-driven Q-learning-","multicore processors","dynamic reliability management technique","long-term reliability issues","processor subject","reliability constraint","frequency scaling","control knobs","program phases","optimal working modes","phase detection","highly diverse phases","management efficiency","high-diver programs","Q-learning-based techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic reliability management (DRM)","phase detection","reinforcement learning","thermal prediction"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/8877482/8500286-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Phase-Driven <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Learning-Based DRM for Multicore Processors","accessionNumber":"19062009","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8500286/","volume":"38","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Enhanced Phase-Driven <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Learning-Based DRM for Multicore Processors","sourcePdf":"tcad-yang-2877014-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10954S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8877482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","xplore-issue":"8877482","articleId":"8500286","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8500296,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8877482/8500296/wang-2877010-small.gif","p":["Ying Wang (M\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China, in 2014.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with ICT, CAS.

In addition to the broad applicability scope of such deep learning (DL) accelerators, we found that the fascinating feature of deterministic performance makes them ideal candidates as application-processors in embedded SoCs concerned with real-time processing. However, unlike traditional accelerator designs, DL accelerators introduce the new aspect of design tradeoff between real-time processing [quality of service (QoS)] and computation approximation [quality of result (QoR)] into embedded systems. This paper proposes an elastic CNN acceleration architecture that automatically adapts to the user-specified QoS constraint by exploiting the error-resilience in typical approximate computing workloads. For the first time, the proposed design, including the network tuning-and-mapping software and reconfigurable accelerator hardware, aims to reconcile the design constraint of QoS and QoR, which are respectively, the critical concerns in real-time and approximate computing. It is shown in experiments the proposed architecture enables the embedded system to work flexibly in an expanded operating space, significantly enhances its real-time ability, and maximizes the system energy-efficiency within the user-specified QoS-QoR constraint through self-reconfiguration. Also, we showcase the application of the proposed design approach to lower power image recognition challenge (LPIRC) and how it is employed to forge an energy-efficient solution to the LPIRC contest.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8877482/08500296.pdf","startPage":"1995","endPage":"2007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS-QoR Aware CNN Accelerator Design Approach","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2877010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8877482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2877010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A QoS-QoR Aware CNN Accelerator Design Approach","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","accessionNumber":"19062007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8500296/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61874124, 61504153, 61432017, 61532017, 61402146 and 61521092"},{"fundingName":"YESS Hip Program by CAST"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS-QoR Aware CNN Accelerator Design Approach","sourcePdf":"tcad-wang-2877010-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08958S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8877482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8877482","articleId":"8500296","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8500306,"authors":[{"name":"Boyang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085637188"},{"name":"Jafar Saniie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Saniie","id":"37300151000"},{"name":"Sasan Bakhtiari","affiliation":["Nuclear Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Sasan","lastName":"Bakhtiari","id":"37387918000"},{"name":"Alexander Heifetz","affiliation":["Nuclear Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Heifetz","id":"37550633600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5398-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5397-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5399-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"8500306","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Transducers","Field programmable gate arrays","Baseband","Frequency modulation","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic communication (telecommunication)","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","system-on-chip","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic communication","RF signal attenuation","ultrasonic wave signal","ZYNQ system-on-chip platform","carrier signal waveform","software defined ultrasonic system","solid channel structures","IQ modulation methods","SoC platform","transmitting transducer","receiving transducer","in-phase-quadrature modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","phase shift keying","PSK","wireless communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasonic Communication","Software Defined Radio","I/Q Modulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500306","abstract":"RF signals are commonly used as a carrier signal in wireless communications.

Therefore, it is our objective is to assess the capability of using ultrasonic waves as a carrier waveform for communications. Ultrasonic signal is a type of waveform which has a frequency higher than 20 kHz. In this study, a ZYNQ System-on-Chip (SoC) platform is used to conduct ultrasonic communication experiments. This system consists of a transmitting transducer and a receiving transducer operating at MHz range frequencies. The transceiver unit operates using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) modulation. With IQ modulation, different modulation schemes such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), phase shift keying (PSK) can be readily implemented on the platform without modifying the hardware setup. Experiments are conducted in solid channels with various shape, material and size to explore the ultrasonic communication feasibility in diverse environments. Performance of different modulation methods are discussed and compared in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500306","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500306.pdf","startPage":"0267","endPage":"0270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Defined Ultrasonic System for Communication Through Solid Structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Software Defined Ultrasonic System for Communication Through Solid Structures","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18192944","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500306/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software Defined Ultrasonic System for Communication Through Solid Structures","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046772S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","citationCount":"10","articleId":"8500306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500308,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa R.

In this paper, we present a framework for classification of brain tumors in MRI images that combines statistical features and neural network algorithms. This algorithm uses region of interest (ROI), i.e. the tumor segment that is identified either manually by the technician/radiologist or by using any of the ROI segmentation techniques. We focus on feature selection by using a combination of the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and 2D Gabor filter techniques. We create the features set using a complete set of the transform domain statistical features. For classification, back propagation neural network classifier has been selected to test the features selection impact. To do so, we used a large dataset consisting of 3,064 slices of T1-weighted MRI images with three types of brain tumors, Meningioma, Glioma, and Pituitary tumor. We obtained a total accuracy of 91.9%, and specificity of 96%, 96.29%, and 95.66% for Meningioma, Glioma, and Pituitary tumor respectively. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the features selection method and indicate that it can compose an effective feature set to be used as a framework that can be combined with other classifications technique to enhance the performance.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2018.8500308","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482102/8500077/08500308.pdf","startPage":"0252","endPage":"0257","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2018.8500308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain Tumor Classification via Statistical Features and Back-Propagation Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Brain Tumor Classification via Statistical Features and Back-Propagation Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18168255","publicationDate":"May 2018","conferenceDate":"3-5 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain Tumor Classification via Statistical Features and Back-Propagation Neural Network","confLoc":"Rochester, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"eit2018-092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050494S","chronDate":"3-5 May 2018","isNumber":"8500077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482102","citationCount":"14","articleId":"8500308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8500321,"authors":[{"name":"Shruthi Mukundan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/8548618/8500321/mukun-2877104-small.gif","p":["Shruthi Mukundan (S\u201915) received the B.Tech degree in\n electrical and electronics engineering from Shanmugha Arts, Science, Technology, and Research Academy (SASTRA)\n University, Thanjavur, India, in 2014.

This integrated charging technology eliminates the on-board charger, leading to a significant reduction in the overall weight and cost of the EV. However, during integrated charging, the induced magnetic fields across the IPMSM windings are unbalanced, which could lead to addition of harmonic current components at the battery side, demagnetization, noise, and vibrations. This paper provides a novel design solution by implementing asymmetrical damper bars in the IPMSM rotor to mitigate unbalanced magnetic fields during integrated charging, and, thus, overcome the aforementioned issues. However, the bars introduced could affect the useful torque production of the machine during traction. Therefore, a magnetic equivalent circuit model based differential evolutionary algorithm is proposed and implemented to optimize the IPMSM rotor structure with dampers to achieve balanced magnetic fields during integrated charging operation and satisfactory traction performance. A comprehensive performance analysis of the optimally designed traction IPMSM equipped with integrated charging capability under both operating conditions is presented in this paper using finite element analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8548618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2018.2877104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/8548618/08500321.pdf","startPage":"2060","endPage":"2069","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2018.2877104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Optimization of Traction IPMSM With Asymmetrical Damper Bars for Integrated Charging Capability Using Evolutionary Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Design and Optimization of Traction IPMSM With Asymmetrical Damper Bars for Integrated Charging Capability Using Evolutionary Algorithm","volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8500321/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18285871","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Optimization of Traction IPMSM With Asymmetrical Damper Bars for Integrated Charging Capability Using Evolutionary Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tec-mukundan-2877104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076623S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"8548618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8548618","articleId":"8500321","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8500325,"authors":[{"name":"Tung T.

This brief proposes a technique that is more accurate than the commonly used three-sample parabolic fit in applications where the distortion introduced by the channel is not too large. The technique approximates the analog signal in the vicinity of its peak with a two parameter function, the logarithm of which is approximated with a straight line. One of the parameters is the location and the other is the amplitude of the peak. Two samples, one on each side of the peak, are used to estimate the location of the peak.

To show the proposed concept, the building elements involving dual-function amplifier antenna are highlighted as an example and arranged in a series-connected array, each acting simultaneously as a matching circuit and transmitting antenna. In other words, a single geometrical space serves as both circuits and antennas, meaning a space overlap in which the circuit is an antenna and the antenna is a circuit. This reflects both the harmony and harmonious relationship of the circuit antenna. In this paper, the spacing between two neighboring array elements is utilized to accommodate active devices, such as transistors, in this example. As the first theoretical and experimental demonstration, this paper involves the design of patch antennas, the analysis of mutual coupling, and the placement of amplifying transistors in different operation modes. The modeling procedure for a 1 x N amplifier-antenna system is presented. The proposed concept is experimentally validated by prototyping a 1 x 2 amplifier antenna array at 5 GHz with rectangular patches and off-the-shell HJ-FET. An equivalent circuit network is established for the proposed dual function block. Measured results show that the experimental block has -10 dB matching bandwidth of 125 MHz at the steering angle of +30\u00b0 with an amplifying gain of 11.5 dB. It is also experimentally illustrated that frequency tuning and beam steering can easily be enabled by varying the dc bias. The design of 1x4 amplifier-antenna array at 5 GHz is also discussed to generalize the proposed theory and guide the design of higher order amplifier arrays.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2872962","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8602378/08500332.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2872962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8602378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified and Integrated Circuit Antenna in Front End\u2014A Proof of Concept","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Unified and Integrated Circuit Antenna in Front End\u2014A Proof of Concept","volume":"67","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","accessionNumber":"18385048","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8500332/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSERC Discovery","grantNumber":"RGPIN-06938-17"},{"fundingName":"NSERC-Huawei Industrial Research Chair in Future Wireless Technologies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified and Integrated Circuit Antenna in Front End\u2014A Proof of Concept","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nallandhigal-2872962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0905S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8602378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8602378","articleId":"8500332","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500340,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhou","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","College of Information Science and Technology, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8930649/8500340/zhou-2869375-small.gif","p":["Qi Zhou received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2013.","Her current research interests include fuzzy logic control, neural control, and robust control for nonlinear systems."]},"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38062746900"},{"name":"Shiyi Zhao","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8930649/8500340/zhao-2869375-small.gif","p":["Shiyi Zhao received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2016, where she is currently pursuing the M.S. degree.","Her current research interests include adaptive control for nonlinear systems, neural network control, and finite-time control."]},"firstName":"Shiyi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086549330"},{"name":"Hongyi Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8930649/8500340/li-2869375-small.gif","p":["Hongyi Li (SM\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree in intelligent control from the University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, U.K., in 2012.","He was a Research Associate with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong.

The control objective is to design an adaptive NN controller to guarantee the stability of the systems and obtain good performance. Different from the existing results, which used NN to approximate the nonlinearities directly, NNs are employed to identify the originally designed virtual control signals with unknown nonlinear items in this paper. Moreover, a sequence of virtual control signals and real controller are designed. The adaptive backstepping control method and Lyapunov stability theory are used to prove the proposed controller can ensure all the signals in the systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the output of the systems can track the reference signal closely. Finally, the proposed adaptive control strategy is applied to the Puma 560 robot manipulator to demonstrate its effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2869375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2869375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8930649/08500340.pdf","startPage":"3611","endPage":"3620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Tracking Control for Robotic Manipulators With Dead Zone","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Tracking Control for Robotic Manipulators With Dead Zone","volume":"30","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8500340/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19334835","pubMedId":"30346291","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500340/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673072, 61622302, U1611262, 61803099 and 61425009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2018B030312006"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar","grantNumber":"2017A030306014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010226","fundingName":"Department of Education of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016KTSCX030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007620","fundingName":"Department of Education of Liaoning Province","grantNumber":"LZ2017001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017FZA5010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012245","fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017B010116006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Tracking Control for Robotic Manipulators With Dead Zone","sourcePdf":"tnnls-li-2869375-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197163S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8930649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"8930649","articleId":"8500340","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500341,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Renda","affiliation":["KU-CARS, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/8558659/8500341/renda-2868815-small.gif","p":["Federico Renda received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in biomedical\n engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

In this work, an alternative model for multisection soft manipulator dynamics is presented based on a discrete Cosserat approach, in which the continuous Cosserat model is discretized by assuming a piecewise constant strain along the soft arm. As a consequence, the soft manipulator state is described by a finite set of constant strains. This approach has several advantages with respect to the existing models. First, it takes into account shear and torsional deformations, which are both essential to cope with out-of-plane external loads. Furthermore, it inherits desirable geometrical and mechanical properties of the continuous Cosserat model, such as intrinsic parameterization and greater generality. Finally, this approach allows to extend to soft manipulators, the recursive composite-rigid-body and articulated-body algorithms, whose performances are compared through a cantilever beam simulation. The soundness of the model is demonstrated through extensive simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2018.2868815","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2018.2868815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558659","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/8558659/08500341.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete Cosserat Approach for Multisection Soft Manipulator Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500341/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Discrete Cosserat Approach for Multisection Soft Manipulator Dynamics","volume":"34","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8500341/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18325311","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Khalifa University Center for Autonomous Robotic System","grantNumber":"FSU-2018-08"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete Cosserat Approach for Multisection Soft Manipulator Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tro-renda-2868815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103823S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"8558659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8558659","articleId":"8500341","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":8500342,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Wang","affiliation":["School of Marine Electrical Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, P.

Using nested coordinate transformations, the AUSV is formulated in a cascade structure consisting of translation and rotation subsystems with complex uncertainties. Finite-time uncertainty observers (FUOs) are devised to exactly estimate transformed uncertainties, and enable separation principle in controller and observer syntheses. By virtue of creating yaw-guided dynamics, rotation tracking is shaped to stabilize yaw and sway tracking discrepancies, simultaneously, in collaboration with yaw controller. Nominal dynamics of translation tracking errors are globally asymptotically stabilized by surge-control synthesis using cascade analysis and Lyapunov approach, and thereby contributing to global asymptotic stability of the entire translation-rotation tracking system. Eventually, an FUO-based yaw-guided tracking control (FUO-YTC) scheme of an AUSV with complex uncertainties is established. Simulation studies demonstrate remarkable performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Yaw-Guided Trajectory Tracking Control of an Asymmetric Underactuated Surface Vehicle","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2018.2877046","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8736410/08500342.pdf","startPage":"3502","endPage":"3513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2018.2877046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8736410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","displayDocTitle":"Yaw-Guided Trajectory Tracking Control of an Asymmetric Underactuated Surface Vehicle","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8500342/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18741002","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51009017 and 51379002"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Dalian Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"2016RJ10"},{"fundingName":"Stable Supporting Fund of Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Laboratory","grantNumber":"SXJQR2018WDKT03"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3132016314 and 3132018126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yaw-Guided Trajectory Tracking Control of an Asymmetric Underactuated Surface Vehicle","sourcePdf":"tii-wang-2877046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110455S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8736410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8736410","articleId":"8500342","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8500346,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmedullah Aziz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/8540961/8500346/aziz-2873738-small.gif","p":["Ahmedullah Aziz (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University at University Park, PA, USA, in 2016.

With proper device-circuit optimization, TSA MRAM shows up to 70% larger sense margin, ~27% higher data stability with ~40% less power for read operation compared to STT MRAM (in nominal condition). We evaluate the impact of variation on TSA MRAM through Monte Carlo simulations. We report that even with variation induced spread in the distribution of bit-line voltages, TSA MRAM provides ~1.7\u00d7 larger voltage differential between parallel and antiparallel states. For the write operation, the TSA MRAM consumes ~10% less average power and demands only ~5% more write time extension than the STT MRAM to achieve the same level of variation tolerance.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2018.2873738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8540961/08500346.pdf","startPage":"5381","endPage":"5389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2018.2873738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8540961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold Switch Augmented STT MRAM: Design Space Analysis and Device-Circuit Co-Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Threshold Switch Augmented STT MRAM: Design Space Analysis and Device-Circuit Co-Design","volume":"65","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18271970","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500346/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500346/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold Switch Augmented STT MRAM: Design Space Analysis and Device-Circuit Co-Design","sourcePdf":"ted-aziz-2873738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064659S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8540961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8540961","articleId":"8500346","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500349,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8930649/8500349/zli-2872595-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Li (M\u201907\u2013SM\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree in mechatronics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.","From 2003 to 2005, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent systems, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan.

Adaptive controllers in joint space, a redundancy resolution method at the velocity level, and commands that generated from BMI in task space have been integrated effectively to make the robot perform manipulation tasks controlled by human operator's electroencephalogram. By extracting the features from neural activity, the proposed intention decoding algorithm can generate the commands to control the exoskeleton robot. To achieve optimal motion, a redundancy resolution at the velocity level has been implemented through neural dynamics optimization. Considering human-robot interaction force as well as coupled dynamics during the exoskeleton operation, an adaptive controller with redundancy resolution has been designed to drive the exoskeleton tracking the planned trajectory in human brain and to offer a convenient method of dynamics compensation with minimal knowledge of the dynamics parameters of the exoskeleton robot. Extensive experiments which employed a few subjects have been carried out. In the experiments, subjects successfully fulfilled the given manipulation tasks with convergence of tracking errors, which verified that the proposed brain-controlled exoskeleton robot system is effective.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2872595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2872595","startPage":"3558","endPage":"3571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8930649/08500349.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Control of a Kinematically Redundant Exoskeleton Robot Using Brain\u2013Machine Interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Control of a Kinematically Redundant Exoskeleton Robot Using Brain\u2013Machine Interfaces","volume":"30","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","accessionNumber":"19334826","pubMedId":"30346293","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8500349/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573147, 61625303 and 61751310"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2017YFB1302302"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Research Collaborative Innovation Projects","grantNumber":"2014B090901056, 2015B020214003 and 2016A020220003"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Plan Project through Application Technology Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2015B020233006"},{"fundingName":"Anhui Science and Technology Major Program","grantNumber":"17030901029"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Control of a Kinematically Redundant Exoskeleton Robot Using Brain\u2013Machine Interfaces","sourcePdf":"tnnls-li-2872595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184905S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8930649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8930649","articleId":"8500349","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500350,"authors":[{"name":"Eunjung Cha","affiliation":["GigaHertz Centre, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00fcteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8521720/8500350/cha-2872566-small.gif","p":["Eunjung Cha received the M.Sc. degree in physics from Lund University, Lund, Sweden, in 2014.

In order to mitigate the overhead of cyclic prefix (CP) originating from shortened symbol duration for low-latency communications, 5G wireless systems need to adopt short CP lengths. As channel delay spread must be less than the CP length, we first derive the effective root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread and the achievable rate using the zero-forcing assumption. We construct a sum rate optimization problem for each user subject to delay spread constraints and then convert the problem into a solvable convex problem along with a semi-definite relaxation technique. The precoding matrix is finally obtained by solving optimization problems for all users. Numerical results reveal that the proposed scheme attains superior performance to the conventional sum rate optimization, as well as small RMS delay spread.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum Rate Maximization With Shortened Cyclic Prefix in a MIMO-OFDM System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2876913","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8577058/08500352.pdf","startPage":"12416","endPage":"12420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2876913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Sum Rate Maximization With Shortened Cyclic Prefix in a MIMO-OFDM System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8500352/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18345016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Brain Korea 21 Plus Project in 2018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Rate Maximization With Shortened Cyclic Prefix in a MIMO-OFDM System","sourcePdf":"tvt-lee-2876913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066249S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8500352","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8500354,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ghahremani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8602378/8500354/ghahr-2873702-small.gif","p":["Ali Ghahremani (S\u201917) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

Due to incorporating two tuned tanks, the dependence on the load impedance is, however, relatively large, resulting in, e.g., load-dependent output power, power efficiency, peak voltages, and peak (and average) currents which can lead to reliability issues. This paper presents load-pull analyses for class-E RF PAs from a mathematical perspective, with analyses and discussions of the effects of the most common nonidealities of class-E PAs: the limited loaded quality factor (Qloaded) of the series filter, switch ON-resistance, the limited quality factor of the dc-feed inductor, load mismatch-dependent switch conduction loss, and the limited negative voltage excursions (due to, e.g., the reverse conduction of the switch transistor for negative voltage excursions). The theoretical findings are backed up by extensive circuit simulations and load-pull measurements of a class-E PA implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology. The PA provides 18.1-dBm output power and 72% efficiency at 1.4 GHz under nominal operating condition employing an off-chip matching network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500354/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18385029","volume":"67","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Load Mismatch Sensitivity of Class-E Power Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Mismatch Sensitivity of Class-E Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ghahremani-2873702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097474S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8602378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8602378","articleId":"8500354","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8500357,"authors":[{"name":"Mingheng Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Structural Analysis for Industrial Equipment, and the School of Automotive Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Mingheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086487806"},{"name":"Xiaojuan Zhai","affiliation":["School of Automotive Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojuan","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37086488495"},{"name":"Guang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Automotive Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086487099"},{"name":"Tonghong Chong","affiliation":["School of Automotive Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Tonghong","lastName":"Chong","id":"37086487035"},{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086022878"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500357","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Fatigue","Vehicles","Training","Heuristic algorithms","Analytical models","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model","driver fatigue identification","dynamic process","confusion matrix","particle swarm optimization algorithm","training process","PSO algorithm","eye closing time","original model","initial value selection process","improved HMM training","PERCLOS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver fatigue","hidden Markov model","forward-backward algorithm","particle swarm optimization"]}],"abstract":"A hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied to describe the dynamic process of driver fatigue over time. However, during the HMM training, the initial value selection of the confusion matrix has a great influence on the accuracy ofthe HHM, which brings a lot of inconveniences to the practical application. Therefore, this study applied a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to simplify the training process without affecting the accuracy of the HMM. In the beginning, an improved HMM was built based on the PSO algorithm, and then was trained by the adoption of the collected data of percentage of eye closing time over a certain period (PERCLOS), which was measured from twenty participants in a driving simulator experiment. Finally, the improved model was compared with the original model, and it didn't require the initial value selection process based on the prior condition to achieve the global optimum and improve accuracy. It indicates that the proposed method can provide an effective way for driver fatigue identification.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500357","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500357.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Application of Particle Swarm Algorithms to optimize Hidden Markov Models for Driver Fatigue Identification*","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500357/","displayDocTitle":"An Application of Particle Swarm Algorithms to optimize Hidden Markov Models for Driver Fatigue Identification*","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18167985","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Application of Particle Swarm Algorithms to optimize Hidden Markov Models for Driver Fatigue Identification*","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049028S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8500357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500376,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yuhao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086342241"},{"name":"Ivan Wang-Hei Ho","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Ivan Wang-Hei","lastName":"Ho","id":"37408968700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500376","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Machine learning","Global Positioning System","Statistical analysis","Task analysis","Neural networks","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","feature extraction","Global Positioning System","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","recurrent neural nets","road vehicles","sensors","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous driving","big data","input sensor data","autonomous vehicles","semantic-level driving characteristics","safe driving control","handcrafted driving features","feature classification","sematic-level driving behaviors","large-scale GPS sensor data","layer-by-layer statistical analysis method","supervised learning","high-level feature abstraction","sensory data","joint histogram feature map","deep learning methodologies","optimal driving behavior characterization","driving maneuver classification task","hierarchical deep learning model","deep neural network modelling","driving behaviors","machine learning","long short-term memory neural network","driver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Machine Learning","Statistical Analysis","Driving Behaviour aassification","Autonomous Driving"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500376","abstract":"Google defines the concept of autonomous driving as one of the applications of big data. Specifically, with the input sensor data, the autonomous vehicles can be provided with the semantic-level driving characteristics for an accurate and safe driving control. However, both the enumeration of handcrafted driving features with expert knowledge and the feature classification with machine learning for characterizing driving behaviors is lack of practicability under a complex scale. Therefore, this study focuses on detecting the sematic-level driving behaviors from large-scale GPS sensor data. Specifically, we classified different driving maneuvers from a huge amount of dataset through a layer-by-layer statistical analysis method. The identified maneuver information with the corresponding driver ID is useful for the supervised learning of high-level feature abstraction with neural network. With the aim of analyzing the sensory data with deep learning in a consumable form, we propose a joint histogram feature map to regularize the shallow features in this paper. Besides, extensive simulation is conducted to evaluate different machine learning and deep learning methodologies for optimal driving behavior characterization. Overall, our results indicate that Deep Neural Network (DNN) is suitable for the driving maneuver classification task with more than 94% accuracy, while Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network performs well with a 92% accuracy in identifying a specific driver. However, LSTM shows degraded accuracy when the scale of the identification task becomes larger. In this case, a hierarchical deep learning model is proposed, and simulation results show that the combination of DNN and LSTM in this hierarchical model can well maintain the prediction accuracy even when the scale of the recognition task is four times larger.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500376","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500376.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Deep Neural Network Modelling and Statistical Analysis on Characterizing Driving Behaviors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500376/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Deep Neural Network Modelling and Statistical Analysis on Characterizing Driving Behaviors","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18168091","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Deep Neural Network Modelling and Statistical Analysis on Characterizing Driving Behaviors","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038992S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"6","articleId":"8500376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":8500377,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Qin","affiliation":["Qingdao Academy of Intelligent Industries, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Qin","id":"38468796200"},{"name":"Yong Yuan","affiliation":["Qingdao Academy of Intelligent Industries, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086317748"},{"name":"Shuai Wang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086278291"},{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["Qingdao Academy of Intelligent Industries, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Fei-Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086099304"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500377","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":815},"abstract":"With the development of the blockchain technology, Bitcoin mining has become more and more popular.

In Bitcoin blockchain, miners provide computational services (i.e. mining) to get profits from the fixed rewards of newly found block and also transaction fees from recording the users' transactions to the blocks. With the decreasing of the fixed new block reward, transaction fees will play the role as the main profit source of miners, thus provide important supports for the sustainability and vitality of the Bitcoin system. Therefore, it is of great necessity to research transaction fees. In this paper, we investigate transaction fees in a queuing game with non-preemptive priority, in which both the miners' mining rewards and the users' time cost are highlighted.

The majority of current researches fix the number of driving intentions by considering only a specific scenario. However, distinct driving environments usually contain various possible driving maneuvers. Therefore, a intention prediction method that can adapt to different traffic scenarios is needed. To further improve the overall vehicle prediction performance, motion information is usually incorporated with classified intentions. As suggested in some literature, the methods that directly predict possible goal locations can achieve better performance for long-term motion prediction than other approaches due to their automatic incorporation of environment constraints. Moreover, by obtaining the temporal information of the predicted destinations, the optimal trajectories for predicted vehicles as well as the desirable path for ego autonomous vehicle could be easily generated. In this paper, we propose a Semantic based Intention and Motion Prediction (SIMP) method, which can be adapted to any driving scenarios by using semantic defined vehicle behaviors. It utilizes a probabilistic framework based on deep neural network to estimate the intentions, final locations, and the corresponding time information for surrounding vehicles. An exemplar real-world scenario was used to implement and examine the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500419","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500419.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"313","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Prediction of Vehicle Semantic Intention and Motion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Prediction of Vehicle Semantic Intention and Motion","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18167979","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500419/","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Prediction of Vehicle Semantic Intention and Motion","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059712S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":8500421,"authors":[{"name":"Cumhur Erkan Tuncali","affiliation":["Toyota Technical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Cumhur Erkan","lastName":"Tuncali","id":"37085666692"},{"name":"Georgios Fainekos","affiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, USA"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Fainekos","id":"38529834400"},{"name":"Hisahiro Ito","affiliation":["Toyota Technical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Hisahiro","lastName":"Ito","id":"37085449723"},{"name":"James Kapinski","affiliation":["Toyota Technical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Kapinski","id":"37326801700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500421","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1093},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500421","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Autonomous vehicles","Artificial neural networks","Virtual environments","Sensors","Computational modeling","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","driver information systems","intelligent transportation systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","program testing","road vehicles","software fault tolerance","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous driving systems","simulation-based adversarial test generation","autonomous vehicles","automatic falsification methods","cyber-physical systems","test case generation","machine learning","closed-loop properties","virtual environment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500421","endPage":"1562","startPage":"1555","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation-based Adversarial Test Generation for Autonomous Vehicles with Machine Learning Components","abstract":"Many organizations are developing autonomous driving systems, which are expected to be deployed at a large scale in the near future.

One of the main challenges is that many autonomous driving systems have machine learning (ML) components, such as deep neural networks, for which formal properties are difficult to characterize. We present a testing framework that is compatible with test case generation and automatic falsification methods, which are used to evaluate cyber-physical systems. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to evaluate closed-loop properties of an autonomous driving system model that includes the ML components, all within a virtual environment.

Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop appropriate security protocols facilitating V2I and V2V communication. This paper presents a model for smart traffic infrastructure consisting of numerous entities like smart sensors, intelligent vehicles, base stations along with a new user authentication and key-exchange protocol which aids in the establishment of a secure session for communication between the entities.

Many methods utilize the current kinematics of vehicles to make these predictions, but it is possible to examine the relations between vehicles as well to gain more information about the traffic scene and make more accurate predictions. The work presented in this paper proposes a novel method of predicting lane change maneuvers in highway scenarios using deep learning and a generic visual representation of the traffic scene. Experimental results suggest that by operating on the visual representation, the spacial relations between arbitrary vehicles can be captured by our method and used for more informed predictions without the need for explicit dynamic or driver interaction models. The proposed method is evaluated on highway driving scenarios using the Interstate-80 dataset and compared to a kinematics based prediction model, with results showing that the proposed method produces more robust predictions across the prediction horizon than the comparison model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Road transportation","Machine

We propose an end-to-end steering controller with CNN-based closed-loop feedback for autonomous vehicles that improves driving performance compared to traditional CNN-based approaches. This paper demonstrates that the proposed neural network, DAVE-2SKY, is able to learn to inference steering wheel angles for the lateral control of self-driving vehicles through initial supervised pre-training and subsequent reinforced closed-loop post-training with images from a camera mounted on the vehicle. We used the PreScan simulator and Caffe deep learning framework for training under diversified circumstances in a software in the loop (SIL) simulation environment.

The performance of the proposed system has been investigated under simulations and on-road tests as well.

Surrounding-aware Lane-changing Behavior from Observed Trajectories","abstract":"Predicting lane-changing intentions has long been a very active area of research in the autonomous driving community. However, most of the literature has focused on individual vehicles and did not consider both the neighbor information and the accumulated effects of vehicle history trajectories when making the predictions. We propose to apply a surrounding-aware LSTM algorithm for predicting the intention of a vehicle to perform a lane change that takes advantage of both vehicle past trajectories and their neighbor's current states. We trained the model on real-world lane changing data and were able to show in simulation that these two components can lead not only to higher accuracy, but also to earlier lane-changing prediction time, which plays an important role in potentially improving the autonomous vehicle's overall performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500445/","accessionNumber":"18168075","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8500445/","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning Vehicle Surrounding-aware Lane-changing Behavior from Observed Trajectories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Vehicle Surrounding-aware Lane-changing Behavior from Observed Trajectories","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06398S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8500469,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Reinders","affiliation":["Institute for Information Processing, Leibniz University Hanover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Reinders","id":"37086488712"},{"name":"Hanno Ackermann","affiliation":["Institute for Information Processing, Leibniz University Hanover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Hanno","lastName":"Ackermann","id":"37546303400"},{"name":"Michael Ying Yang","affiliation":["Scene Understanding Group, University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Michael Ying","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086073066"},{"name":"Bodo Rosenhahn","affiliation":["Institute for Information Processing, Leibniz University Hanover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Bodo","lastName":"Rosenhahn","id":"37294525800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500469","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"abstract":"In recent years, data-driven methods have shown great success for extracting information about the infrastructure in urban areas. These algorithms are usually trained on large datasets consisting of thousands or millions of labeled training examples. While large datasets have been published regarding cars, for cyclists very few labeled data is available although appearance, point of view, and positioning of even relevant objects differ. Unfortunately, labeling data is costly and requires a huge amount of work. In this paper, we thus address the problem of learning with very few labels. The aim is to recognize particular traffic signs in crowdsourced data to collect information which is of interest to cyclists. We propose a system for object recognition that is trained with only 15 examples per class on average. To achieve this, we combine the advantages of convolutional neural networks and random forests to learn a patch-wise classifier. In the next step, we map the random forest to a neural network and transform the classifier to a fully convolutional network. Thereby, the processing of full images is significantly accelerated and bounding boxes can be predicted. Finally, we integrate data of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to localize the predictions on the map. In comparison to Faster R-CNN and other networks for object recognition or algorithms for transfer learning, we considerably reduce the required amount of labeled data. We demonstrate good performance on the recognition of traffic signs for cyclists as well as their localization in maps.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forestry","Feature extraction","Training","Bicycles","Automobiles","Neurons","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bicycles","cartography","convolution","feedforward neural nets","Global Positioning System","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic signs","bicycle maps","Faster R-CNN","GPS","transfer learning","Global Positioning System","fully convolutional network","patch-wise classifier","random forest","convolutional neural networks","crowdsourced data","labeled training examples","urban areas","data-driven methods","object recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500469","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500469.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Recognition from very few Training Examples for Enhancing Bicycle Maps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Object Recognition from very few Training Examples for Enhancing Bicycle Maps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500469/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500469/","accessionNumber":"18167869","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Recognition from very few Training Examples for Enhancing Bicycle Maps","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068655S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":8500493,"authors":[{"name":"Nachiket Deo","affiliation":["Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nachiket","lastName":"Deo","id":"37086123094"},{"name":"Mohan M.

Multiple interacting agents, the multi-modal nature of driver behavior, and the inherent uncertainty involved in the task make motion prediction of surrounding vehicles a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an LSTM model for interaction aware motion prediction of surrounding vehicles on freeways. Our model assigns confidence values to maneuvers being performed by vehicles and outputs a multi-modal distribution over future motion based on them. We compare our approach with the prior art for vehicle motion prediction on the publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Our results show an improvement in terms of RMS values of prediction error. We also present an ablative analysis of the components of our proposed model and analyze the predictions made by the model in complex traffic scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500493/","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18167936","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles with Maneuver based LSTMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles with Maneuver based LSTMs","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0640.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049863S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"81","articleId":"8500493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500504,"authors":[{"name":"Marvin Teichmann","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Marvin","lastName":"Teichmann"},{"name":"Michael Weber","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Weber"},{"name":"Marius Z\u00f6llner","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Z\u00f6llner"},{"name":"Roberto Cipolla","affiliation":["University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, GB"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Cipolla"},{"name":"Raquel Urtasun","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Raquel","lastName":"Urtasun"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500504","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2700},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500504","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Decoding","Semantics","Computer architecture","Proposals","Feature extraction","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","image classification","image segmentation","inference mechanisms","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time joint semantic reasoning","autonomous driving","semantic segmentation","unified architecture","KITTI dataset","joint classification","MultiNet"]}],"abstract":"While most approaches to semantic reasoning have focused on improving performance, in this paper we argue that computational times are very important in order to enable real time applications such as autonomous driving.

Besides using Mobile Broadband (MBB), there is a need to develop Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) applications with cellular networks especially when safety-related driving applications are concerned. Future cellular networks are expected to support novel latencysensitive use cases. Many applications of V2X communication, like collaborative autonomous driving requires very low latency and high reliability in order to support real-time communication between vehicles and other network elements. In this paper, we classify V2X use-cases and their requirements in order to identify cellular network technologies able to support them. The bottleneck problem of the medium access in 4G Long Term Evolution(LTE) networks is random access procedure. It is evaluated through simulations to further detail the future limitations and requirements. Limitations and improvement possibilities for next generation of cellular networks are finally detailed. Moreover, the results presented in this paper provide the limits of different parameter sets with regard to the requirements of V2X-based applications.

Our proposed system can achieve up to 83% average precision accuracy when compared to baseline of 78%.Furthermore, comparing the effects of different combinations of object characteristics on precision and recall accuracy show promising insights on factors affecting reliable estimation of object of fixation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500532","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500532.pdf","startPage":"2042","endPage":"2047","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object of Fixation Estimation by Joint Analysis of Gaze and Object Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Object of Fixation Estimation by Joint Analysis of Gaze and Object Dynamics","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500532/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18183322","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500532/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object of Fixation Estimation by Joint Analysis of Gaze and Object Dynamics","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119049S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8500543,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Bijelic","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Wilhelm-Runge-Str. 11, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Bijelic","id":"37086488671"},{"name":"Tobias Gruber","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Wilhelm-Runge-Str. 11, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Gruber","id":"37085998112"},{"name":"Werner Ritter","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Wilhelm-Runge-Str. 11, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Ritter","id":"37283474100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500543","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":881},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Sensors","Meteorology","Measurement by laser beam","Laser modes","Semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astatine","atmospheric techniques","fog","optical radar","remote sensing by laser beam","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lidar systems","undisturbed lidar data","bad weather situations","tuning internal parameters","disturbance patterns","fog chamber","controlled conditions","rain","lidar sensors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500543","abstract":"Autonomous driving at level five does not only means self-driving in the sunshine.

The latter allows the car to properly position itself within the road lanes, which is also crucial for any subsequent lane departure or trajectory planning decision in fully autonomous cars. Traditional lane detection methods rely on a combination of highly-specialized, hand-crafted features and heuristics, usually followed by post-processing techniques, that are computationally expensive and prone to scalability due to road scene variations. More recent approaches leverage deep learning models, trained for pixel-wise lane segmentation, even when no markings are present in the image due to their big receptive field. Despite their advantages, these methods are limited to detecting a pre-defined, fixed number of lanes, e.g. ego-lanes, and can not cope with lane changes. In this paper, we go beyond the aforementioned limitations and propose to cast the lane detection problem as an instance segmentation problem - in which each lane forms its own instance - that can be trained end-to-end. To parametrize the segmented lane instances before fitting the lane, we further propose to apply a learned perspective transformation, conditioned on the image, in contrast to a fixed \u201dbird's-eye view\u201d transformation. By doing so, we ensure a lane fitting which is robust against road plane changes, unlike existing approaches that rely on a fixed, predefined transformation. In summary, we propose a fast lane detection algorithm, running at 50 fps, which can handle a variable number of lanes and cope with lane changes. We verify our method on the tuSimple dataset and achieve competitive results.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500547","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","startPage":"286","endPage":"291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards End-to-End Lane Detection: an Instance Segmentation Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards End-to-End Lane Detection: an Instance Segmentation Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500547/","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18183395","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards End-to-End Lane Detection: an Instance Segmentation Approach","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053108S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"99","articleId":"8500547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8500548,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xing","affiliation":["Advanced Vehicle Engineering Centre, Cranfield University, Bedford, UK"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xing","id":"37086297251"},{"name":"Jianlin Tang","affiliation":["JIANGSU XCMG CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY RESEARCH INSTITUTE LTD.

In this study, an end-to-end driving-related tasks recognition system is proposed. Specifically, seven common driving activities are identified, which are normal driving, right mirror checking, rear mirror checking, left mirror checking, using in-vehicle video device, texting, and answering mobile phone. Among these, the first four activities are regarded as normal driving tasks, while the rest three are divided into distraction group. The images are collected using a consumer range camera, namely, Kinect. In total, five drivers are involved in the naturalistic data collection. Before training the identification model, the raw images are first segmented using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to extract the driver region from the background. Then, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is trained to classify the behaviors, which directly takes the processed RGB images as the input and outputs the identified label. In this work, the AIexNet is selected as the pre-trained CNN model. Then, to reduce the training cost, the transfer learning mechanism is applied to the CNN model. An average of 79% detection accuracy is achieved for the seven driving tasks. The proposed integration model can be used as a low-cost driver distraction and dangerous tasks recognition modeL.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500548","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500548.pdf","startPage":"1626","endPage":"1631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Driving Activities and Secondary Tasks Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Driving Activities and Secondary Tasks Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning","htmlLink":"/document/8500548/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18167876","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-End Driving Activities and Secondary Tasks Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089579S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500551,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Lv","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, P.R., Shannxi, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Lv","id":"37086487659"},{"name":"Ziyi Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, P.R., Shannxi, China"],"firstName":"Ziyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086365233"},{"name":"Jingmin Xin","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, P.R., Shannxi, China"],"firstName":"Jingmin","lastName":"Xin","id":"37287669900"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, P.R., Shannxi, China"],"firstName":"Nanning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37271536700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500551","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Roads","Streaming media","Three-dimensional displays","Convolution","Fuses","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image colour analysis","image representation","object detection","optical radar","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale contextual information","stream fusion fully convolutional network","autonomous driving systems","road detection","two-stream fusion","KITTI- ROAD benchmark","TSF-FCN","RGB stream","LIDAR point clouds","LIDAR stream","RGB images"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500551","abstract":"Road detection is one of the most basic tasks of autonomous driving systems.

One stream of this network is LIDAR stream which aggregates multi-scale contextual information from LIDAR point clouds. The other stream is RGB stream which is used for extracting features from RGB images. To fuse the two streams, the feature maps of RGB stream are converted to a bird-view representation to concatenate with that of LIDAR stream. In this way, the two kinds of data can complement each other for detecting road.

Predicting motions of pedestrians is especially hard since they move in less structured environments and have less inertia compared to road vehicles. To account for this uncertainty, we present an approach for probabilistic prediction of pedestrian motion using Markov chains. In contrast to previous work, we not only consider motion models, constraints from a semantic map, and various goals, but also explicitly adapt the prediction based on crash probabilities with other traffic participants. Also, our approach works in any situation; this is typically challenging for pure machine learning techniques that learn behaviors for a particular road section and which might consequently struggle with a different road section. The usefulness of combining the aforementioned aspects in a single approach is demonstrated by an evaluation using recordings of real pedestrians.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500562","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500562.pdf","startPage":"1285","endPage":"1292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Map-based Pedestrian Motion Prediction Taking Traffic Participants into Consideration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Map-based Pedestrian Motion Prediction Taking Traffic Participants into Consideration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8500562/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18168017","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Map-based Pedestrian Motion Prediction Taking Traffic Participants into Consideration","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101175S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":8500564,"authors":[{"name":"Ian Tu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Tu","id":"37086487527"},{"name":"Abhir Bhalerao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Abhir","lastName":"Bhalerao","id":"37270294900"},{"name":"Nathan Griffiths","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Griffiths","id":"37267036600"},{"name":"Mauricio Mu\u00f1oz Delgado","affiliation":["Jaguar Land Rover, Engineering Centre, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Mauricio Mu\u00f1oz","lastName":"Delgado","id":"37086488535"},{"name":"Alasdair Thomason","affiliation":["Jaguar Land Rover, Engineering Centre, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Alasdair","lastName":"Thomason","id":"37085679912"},{"name":"Thomas Popham","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Popham","id":"37547370400"},{"name":"Alex Mouzakitis","affiliation":["Jaguar Land Rover, Engineering Centre, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Mouzakitis","id":"37688988700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500564","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Viewpoint Passenger State Classification Using 3D CNNs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500564","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Monitoring","Cameras","Vehicles","Kinetic theory","Solid modeling","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image motion analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual viewpoint passenger state classification","intelligent vehicle systems","human-machine interactions","dual camera setup","vehicle passengers","deep learning architecture","3D convolutional network","transfer learning","action recognition data","in-vehicle dataset","video recordings","3D action recognition network","action classes"]}],"abstract":"The rise of intelligent vehicle systems will lead to more human-machine interactions and so there is a need to create a bridge between the system and the actions and behaviours of the people inside the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a dual camera setup to monitor the actions and behaviour of vehicle passengers and a deep learning architecture which can utilise video data to classify a range of actions. The method incorporates two different views as input to a 3D convolutional network and uses transfer learning from other action recognition data. The performance of this method is evaluated using an in-vehicle dataset, which contains video recordings of people performing a range of common in-vehicle actions. We show that the combination of transfer learning and using dual viewpoints in a 3D action recognition network offers an increase in classification accuracy of action classes with distinct poses, e.g. mobile phone use and sleeping, whilst it does not apply as well for classifying those actions with small movements, such as talking and eating.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500564","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500564.pdf","startPage":"2163","endPage":"2169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Dual Viewpoint Passenger State Classification Using 3D CNNs","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","accessionNumber":"18183377","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Viewpoint Passenger State Classification Using 3D CNNs","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058587S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","articleId":"8500564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500576,"authors":[{"name":"Chiyu Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiyu","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086089544"},{"name":"John M.

Autonomous vehicles should also man- age these situations by behaving cooperatively and naturally. In this paper, we enhance our previous learning-based method to efficiently estimate other vehicles' intentions and interact with them in ramp merging scenarios, without over-the-air communication between vehicles. The proposed approach inherits our previous Probabilistic grahpical Model (PGM) and distance- keeping framework. Real driving trajectories are used to learn transition models in the PGM. Thus, besides the structure of the PGM, our method does not require human-designed reward or cost functions. The PGM-based intention estimation is followed by an off-the-shelf distance-keeping model to generate proper acceleration/deceleration controls. The PGM plays a plug-in role in our self-driving framework. The new model eliminates two assumptions in the previous model: 1) a fixed merging point for all merging agents, which is hard to determine before the merging vehicles make the merge; 2) Perfect velocity measurement, which requires sophisticated perception systems. We validate the performance of our method both on real merging data and using a designed merging strategy in simulation, and show significant improvements compared with previous methods. Parameter design is also discussed by experiments. The new method is computationally efficient, and exhibits better robustness against sensing uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500576","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1697","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500576.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smooth Behavioral Estimation For Ramp Merging Control In Autonomous Driving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Smooth Behavioral Estimation For Ramp Merging Control In Autonomous Driving","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8500576/","accessionNumber":"18168011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500576/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smooth Behavioral Estimation For Ramp Merging Control In Autonomous Driving","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071979S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":8500577,"authors":[{"name":"Liuhui Wang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Liuhui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086487924"},{"name":"Zhenfei Zhan","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Zhenfei","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37086488270"},{"name":"Xin Yang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089105694"},{"name":"Qingmiao Wang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Qingmiao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086488757"},{"name":"Yufeng Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086489050"},{"name":"Ling Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37535311100"},{"name":"Gang Guo","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086488768"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500577","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automobiles","Biological neural networks","Vehicle dynamics","Neurons","Mathematical model","Accidents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","backpropagation","brakes","braking","control engineering computing","driver information systems","neurocontrollers","road accidents","road safety","road vehicles","three-term control","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BP neural network PID controller","AEB system","autonomous Emergency Braking System","Autonomous Emergency Braking system","PID parameters","coordination control","China","backpropagation neural network PID controller","Advanced Driver Assistance System","dynamics model","CarSim","collision avoidance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500577","abstract":"Rear-end collision is one of the most common collision modes in China, which often leads to severe accident consequences.

The PID parameters can be adjusted in real time based on the self-learning property and self-adapting property of BP neural network. The dynamics model is built in CarSim, and the inverse dynamics model is built in Simulink. Through the coordination control of the throttle angle and brake pressure, the host vehicle can brake automatically to avoid collisions in case of emergency. In addition, three kinds of test scenarios for the target car, stationary, slight braking, emergency braking, are setup based on complex environment in China. Finally, the simulations are conducted in these scenarios.

In this work, we present an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for real time detection of multiple lane boundaries using a camera sensor. Our network has a simple encoder-decoder architecture and is a special two class semantic segmentation network designed to segment lane boundaries. Efficacy of our network stems from two key insights which are at the foundation of all our design decisions. Firstly, we term a lane boundary as a weak class object in the context of semantic segmentation. We show that the weak class objects which occupy relatively few pixels in the scene, also have a relatively low detection accuracy among the know segmentation methods. We present novel design choices and intuitions to improve the segmentation accuracy of weak class objects, which in turn reduces computation time. Our second insight lies in the manner we depict the ground truth information in our derived dataset. Instead of annotating just the visible lane markers, we accurately delineate the lane boundaries in the ground truth for challenging scenarios like occlusions, low light and degraded lane markings. We then leverage the CNN's ability to concisely summarize the global and local context in an image, for accurately inferring lane boundaries in these challenging cases. We evaluate our network against ENet and FCN-8, and found it performing notably better in terms of speed and accuracy. Our network achieves an encouraging 46 FPS performance on NVIDIA Drive PX2 platform and it has been validated on our test vehicle in highway driving conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18167938","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient encoder-decoder CNN architecture for reliable multilane detection in real time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient encoder-decoder CNN architecture for reliable multilane detection in real time","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072956S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","articleId":"8500598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500606,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Zeng","affiliation":["Qingdao Academy of Intelligent Industries, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086488938"},{"name":"Xiaochun Ni","affiliation":["Qingdao Academy of Intelligent Industries, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Ni","id":"37086168488"},{"name":"Yong Yuan","affiliation":["Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086317748"},{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Fei-Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086099304"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500606","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Laboratories","Europe","Bibliometrics","Bitcoin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bibliographic systems","citation analysis","cryptography","database management systems","social networking (online)","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social networks analysis","EI dataset","textual analysis","blockchain technology","bibliometric analysis","bibliographic analysis","China National Knowledge Infrastructure database","Ei Compendex database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","Bibliometric Analysis","Scientific Collaboration","Topic Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500606","abstract":"Taking Ei Compendex (EI) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases as the literature sources, this paper presented a bibliographic analysis of the blockchain-related literature between January 2011 and September 2017.

We also summarized the hot topics on the EI dataset using textual analysis and discovered researchers have shifted their attention from Bitcoin itself to the blockchain technology underlying it.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500606","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500606.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bibliometric Analysis of Blockchain Research","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Bibliometric Analysis of Blockchain Research","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18168093","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500606/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bibliometric Analysis of Blockchain Research","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042808S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8500606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500619,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Mohseni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Mohseni","id":"37086167980"},{"name":"Lars Nielsen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Nielsen","id":"37365623800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500619","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Collision avoidance","Heuristic algorithms","Vehicle dynamics","Autonomous vehicles","Aerodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion-planning method including path-planning","path-planning part","improved RRT method","smooth RRT","SRRT","RRT-based methods","regular traffic maneuvers","motion timing","sampling-based method","motion-timing algorithm","path-planning method","motion planning method","decoupled sampling-based motion-planning method","random tree approach","autonomous vehicles","urban roads","traffic maneuvers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500619","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500619.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled Sampling-Based Velocity Tuning and Motion Planning Method for Multiple Autonomous Vehicles","abstract":"This paper describes a decoupled sampling-based motion-planning method, based on the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) approach, that is applicable to autonomous vehicles, in order to perform different traffic maneuvers. This is a two-step motion-planning method including path-planning and motion timing steps, where both steps are sampling-based. In the path-planning part, an improved RRT method is defined that increases the smoothness of the path and decreases the computational time of the RRT method; it is called smooth RRT, SRRT. While some other RRT-based methods such as RRT can perform better in winding roads, in the problem of interest in this paper (which is performing some regular traffic maneuvers in usual urban roads and highways where the passage is not too winding), SRRT is more efficient since the computational time is less than for the other considered methods. In the motion timing or velocity-tuning step (VTS), a sampling-based method is introduced that guarantees collision avoidance between different vehicles. The proposed motion-timing algorithm can be very useful for collision avoidance and can be used with any other path-planning method. Simulation results show that because of the probabilistic property of the SRRT and VTS algorithms, together with the decoupling feature of the method, the algorithm works well for different traffic maneuvers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500619/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18168033","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled Sampling-Based Velocity Tuning and Motion Planning Method for Multiple Autonomous Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled Sampling-Based Velocity Tuning and Motion Planning Method for Multiple Autonomous Vehicles","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077974S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8500635,"authors":[{"name":"Sascha Wirges","affiliation":["Mobile Perception Systems Group, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Sascha","lastName":"Wirges","id":"37077515700"},{"name":"Christoph Stiller","affiliation":["Mobile Perception Systems Group, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Stiller","id":"37284652100"},{"name":"Felix Hartenbach","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement and Control Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Hartenbach","id":"37086487077"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500635","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"abstract":"A detailed environment representation is a crucial component of automated vehicles. Using single range sensor scans, data is often too sparse and subject to occlusions.

To accomplish this, we estimate motion between subsequent range sensor measurements and create an evidential 3D voxel map in an extensive post-processing step. Within this voxel map, we explicitly model uncertainty using evidence theory and create a 2D projection using combination rules. As input for our neural networks, we use a multi-layer grid map consisting of the three features detections, transmissions and intensity, each for ground and non-ground measurements. Finally, we perform a quantitative and qualitative evaluation which shows that different network architectures accurately infer evidential measures in real-time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Training","Robot sensing systems","Machine learning","Two dimensional displays","Neural networks","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cartography","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evidential occupancy grid map augmentation","Deep Learning","automated vehicles","single range sensor scans","subsequent range sensor measurements","evidence theory","multi-layer grid map","evidential 3D voxel map","2D projection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500635","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500635.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evidential Occupancy Grid Map Augmentation using Deep Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evidential Occupancy Grid Map Augmentation using Deep Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500635/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500635/","accessionNumber":"18167956","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evidential Occupancy Grid Map Augmentation using Deep Learning","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108349S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8472796","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8500355","articleId":"8500635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8500640,"authors":[{"name":"Qianqian Bi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Qianqian","lastName":"Bi","id":"37086487097"},{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085629039"},{"name":"Chunxiang Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Chunxiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085612850"},{"name":"Bing Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085487177"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500640","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Feature extraction","Detectors","Object detection","Benchmark testing","Autonomous vehicles","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","object detection","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic object detection","FMLA-CNN","two-stage detector","multilevel alignment strategy","autonomous driving scenario","feature fusion strategy","proposal generation network","pyramidal feature hierarchy","MLA strategy","detection stage","hierarchical convolutional neural network","feature fusion module","feature layers","fusion and multilevel alignment CNN"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical convolutional neural network for traffic object detection, which is defined as Fusion and Multi-level Alignment CNN (namely FMLA-CNN).

The feature fusion strategy in proposal generation network improves detection accuracy by inserting high-level semantics to the whole pyramidal feature hierarchy. Subsequently the MLA strategy in the second detection stage can exactly reserve spatial locations from corresponding feature layers determined by hierarchical region-of-interest proposals.

In this paper, LoRa is firstly applied into two typical vehicular networks, namely Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), and performance of LoRa schemes with different parameter configurations are evaluated and compared. Further, Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the schemes equipped with higher bandwidth or lower spreading factor exhibit significant advantages in combating the fast fading caused by Doppler effect in networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1111","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500655.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LoRa on the Move: Performance Evaluation of LoRa in V2X Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"LoRa on the Move: Performance Evaluation of LoRa in V2X Communications","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18183394","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LoRa on the Move: Performance Evaluation of LoRa in V2X Communications","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050527S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"5","articleId":"8500655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8500657,"authors":[{"name":"Omair Ghori","affiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Omair","lastName":"Ghori","id":"37086487926"},{"name":"Radek Mackowiak","affiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Radek","lastName":"Mackowiak","id":"37085808274"},{"name":"Miguel Bautista","affiliation":["Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Bautista","id":"38548092500"},{"name":"Niklas Beuter","affiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Niklas","lastName":"Beuter","id":"37546403500"},{"name":"Lucas Drumond","affiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Drumond","id":"37312998400"},{"name":"Ferran Diego","affiliation":["Robert Bosch GmbH, Hildesheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Ferran","lastName":"Diego","id":"37397475700"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Ommer","affiliation":["Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ommer","id":"37397477900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500657","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":351},"abstract":"For an autonomous car, the ability to foresee a humans action is very useful for mitigating the risk of a possible collision. To humans this pedestrian intention foresight comes naturally as they are able to recognize another person's actions just by perceiving subtle changes in posture. Approximating this intention inference ability by directly training a deep neural network is useful but especially challenging. First, sufficiently large datasets for intention recognition with frame-wise human pose and intention annotations are rare and expensive to compile. Second, training on smaller datasets can lead to overfitting and make it difficult to adapt to intra-class variations in action executions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a real time framework that learns (i) intention recognition using weak-supervision and (ii) locomotion dynamics of intention from pose information using transfer learning. This new formulation is able to tackle the lack of frame-wise annotations and to learn intra-class variation in action executions. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed approach leads to earlier and more stable detection of intention than other state of the art approaches with real time operation and the ability to detect intention one second before the pedestrian reaches the kerb.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Visualization","Training","Task analysis","Head","Pose

Learning via Neural Network in Driver Behavior Modeling","abstract":"Inverse Reinforcement Learning(IRL) is formulated within the framework of Markov decision process(MDP) where we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task that we want to learn to perform. Then the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that is expressible as a linear combination of known features specifying the reward function. However, in autonomous driving tasks, due to the difference of scene factor, such as obstacle and weather, the state spaces are frequently large and demonstrations can hardly visit all the states. it's hard to get an optimal policy with RL method to express driver behavior model based on the reward which recovered with IRL method in this large-scale state space. In this paper, we focus on driving behavior modeling with IRL method which introduces the convolutional neural network to extract the associated state feature automatically, and express the policy by neural network to generalize the expert's behaviors. Experimental results compared with the traditional end-to-end method on simulated vehicle show that the accuracy of decision-making greatly improved in the train curve, and in the new curve scene with a large number of unvisited state, this method shows a perfect generalization efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500666/","accessionNumber":"18167878","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Neural Network in Driver Behavior Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Neural Network in Driver Behavior Modeling","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049298S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8500666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8500677,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Hoermann","affiliation":["Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Hoermann","id":"38234688800"},{"name":"Philipp Henzler","affiliation":["Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Henzler","id":"37085411457"},{"name":"Martin Bach","affiliation":["Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Bach","id":"37268143400"},{"name":"Klaus Dietmayer","affiliation":["Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Dietmayer","id":"37283417900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500677","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":585},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500677","abstract":"We tackle the problem of object detection and pose estimation in a shared space downtown environment.

A single-stage deep convolutional neural network is trained to provide object hypotheses comprising of shape, position, orientation and an existence score from a single input DOGMa. Furthermore, an algorithm for offline object extraction was developed to automatically label several hours of training data. The algorithm is based on a two-pass trajectory extraction, forward and backward in time. Typical for engineered algorithms, the automatic label generation suffers from misdetections, which makes hard negative mining impractical. Therefore, we propose a loss function counteracting the high imbalance between mostly static background and extremely rare dynamic grid cells.

In our benchmarks, we use various input image sizes on models that are suitable for FPGA deployment, and investigate the training speed and inference accuracy of selected frameworks for these different sizes on a popular traffic sign recognition dataset. We report results by running the frameworks solely on the CPU as well as by turning on GPU acceleration. We also provide optimizations we apply to fine-tune the performance of the frameworks. We discover that Neon and MXNet deliver the best training speed and inference accuracy in general for all our test cases, while Tensorflow is always among the frameworks with the highest inference accuracies. We also observe that on the particular dataset we tested on (i.e., GTSRB), the image size of the region of interest does not necessarily affect the inference accuracy, and that using deep models, e.g., ResNet-32, which have longer training times, might not provide improvements to inference accuracy.","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500685.pdf","startPage":"1197","endPage":"1203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500685","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benchmarking Deep Learning Frameworks with FPGA-suitable Models on a Traffic Sign Dataset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Benchmarking Deep Learning Frameworks with FPGA-suitable Models on a Traffic Sign Dataset","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500685/","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18183346","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benchmarking Deep Learning Frameworks with FPGA-suitable Models on a Traffic Sign Dataset","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084753S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8500685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500691,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zou","affiliation":["Center for Automotive Electronics, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zou","id":"37086411626"},{"name":"Hua Huang","affiliation":["Schaeffler Technologies, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086487491"},{"name":"Clemens G\u00fchmann","affiliation":["Electronic Measurement and Diagnostic Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"G\u00fchmann","id":"37646440900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4452-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4451-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4453-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"8500691","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Vehicle dynamics","Observers","Biological neural networks","Adaptive systems","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","adaptive control","clutches","neurocontrollers","nonlinear dynamical systems","position control","power transmission (mechanical)","road vehicles","robust control","uncertain systems","variable structure systems","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapid position trajectory tracking performance","clutch position changes","constant control parameters","second-order sliding-mode position controller","neural network","clutch system","clutch controller","Model-in-the-Loop(MiL) simulation","neural networking","On-line Adaptive Position Control","AMT clutch systems","evaluation criteria","automated transmission control algorithms","riding comfort","calibration","transmission control unit","on-line adaptively optimization","automated manual transmission system","nonlinear dynamic system","unknown external disturbances","emission requirements","position trajectory tracking performance","sliding-mode online adaptive position control","Modelica based vehicle model","model-in-the-loop simulation","actuator control algorithm","uncertainties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clutch","Sliding Mode Control","Neural Network","On-line Adaptive"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500691","abstract":"Evaluation criteria of automated transmission control algorithms are an essential research object under increasingly stringent emission requirements and demand for riding comfort. Model-based development and calibration can be employed to optimize the corresponding actuator control algorithm in the transmission control unit (TCU). In this paper, the challenge is to realize on-line adaptively optimization of the controller based on position trajectory. The clutch in an automated manual transmission system is taken as a case study and is considered as a nonlinear dynamic system with uncertainties and unknown external disturbances. A controller with accurate and rapid position trajectory tracking performance is crucial to finding out the correlation between the clutch position changes and the shift quality. Traditionally, the control parameters are manually tuned off-line via trial-and-error, which is time-consuming and often yield poor results. Besides, any controller with constant control parameters has limited ability to adapt to dynamic, real-world conditions. This study proposes a second-order sliding-mode position controller. The parameters are improved based on neural network, to control the clutch system to get better tracking performance on-line adaptive during the vehicle starting. Finally, the clutch controller is embedded into a Modelica\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00ae</sup>\n based vehicle model and verified through the Model-in-the-Loop(MiL) simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that the controller has better tracking performance and stronger robustness compared to the conventional controller and its parameters can be efficiently tuned online via neural networking as opposed to trial-and-error.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500691","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500691.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"178","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Sliding-Mode On-line Adaptive Position Control for AMT Clutch Systems Based On Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Improved Sliding-Mode On-line Adaptive Position Control for AMT Clutch Systems Based On Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18167982","publicationDate":"June 2018","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Sliding-Mode On-line Adaptive Position Control for AMT Clutch Systems Based On Neural Networks","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054299S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","articleId":"8500691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500712,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Kurzer","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Kaiserstr, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Kurzer","id":"37086488478"},{"name":"Chenyang Zhou","affiliation":["FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Haid-und-Neu-Str, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Chenyang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086487154"},{"name":"J.

Based on cooperative modeling of other agents and Decoupled-UCT (a variant of MCTS), the algorithm evaluates the state-action-values of each agent in a cooperative and decentralized manner, explicitly modeling the interdependence of actions between traffic participants. Macro-actions allow for temporal extension over multiple time steps and increase the effective search depth requiring fewer iterations to plan over longer horizons. Without predefined policies for macro-actions, the algorithm simultaneously learns policies over and within macro-actions. The proposed method is evaluated under several conflict scenarios, showing that the algorithm can achieve effective cooperative planning with learned macro-actions in heterogeneous environments.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","startPage":"529","endPage":"536","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500712.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Cooperative Planning for Automated Vehicles with Hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Task analysis","Monte Carlo methods","Decision making","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Vehicles","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","Monte Carlo methods","planning (artificial intelligence)","traffic engineering computing","tree searching","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized cooperative planning","automated vehicles","hierarchical Monte Carlo tree search","MCTS","state-action-values","search depth","cooperative planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Cooperative Planning for Automated Vehicles with Hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500712/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18167916","publicationDate":"June 2018","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Cooperative Planning for Automated Vehicles with Hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048923S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"10","articleId":"8500712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8500715,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian K\u0142usek","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology, al.

These patterns are often modeled with averaged driver model. While this idea is very simple and intuitive in the context of driver classification by his/her patterns of maneuvers, our previous works demonstrated that assumptions underlying such models are often inaccurate and not applicable in general settings. In fact, it is very hard to express driving patterns with simple models. In this article we present a new way of modeling drivers: we employ Long-Short Term Memory networks to learn driver models from telematics data. In particular, our neural network models learn to predict driving-related signals, such as speed or acceleration, given the evolution of these signals up to the point of prediction. Solving this prediction task allows us to capture the behavioral model of the driver. We tested our models on several drivers, by predicting their future decisions. By learning our models on one driver and then evaluating them on another driver, we demonstrate that LSTM models are a powerful tool for driver profiling and detection of abnormal situations. We also evaluate the influence of data preprocessing on the quality of predictions. In this context we use Kalman filering, which can remove noise from uncertain dynamic measurements, in effect giving the best linearly estimated data.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2018.8500715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2018.8500715","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8472796/8500355/08500715.pdf","startPage":"1983","endPage":"1988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Driver Profiling by Using LSTM Networks with Kalman Filtering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2018","accessionNumber":"18167854","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver Profiling by Using LSTM Networks with Kalman Filtering","confLoc":"Changshu, China","sourcePdf":"0321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043511S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2018","isNumber":"8500355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8472796","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8500715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8500740,"authors":[{"name":"Basant K.

In-place RFFT architectures are gaining popularity due to their lower hardware complexity compared with pipeline architectures. But the scaling of in-place RFFT architecture for higher lengths and higher throughput is a challenging issue due to increasing memory access conflict and higher memory bandwidth requirement. In this paper, a design approach is presented to develop an area-delay and energy-efficient architecture for in-place RFFT. Generally, an in-place fast Fourier transform (FFT) structure consists of a butterfly block which performs a set of butterfly operations in every clock cycle. From complexity analysis we find that in-place FFT structures with larger butterfly blocks are more efficient in terms of area-time complexity and energy consumption. The resolution of memory access conflict is however more challenging for higher butterfly block sizes. Therefore, we have analyzed the data-flow and memory footprint of in-place RFFT architectures for different throughput requirements, and based on that, we have proposed here a strategy to partition the storage unit into several banks of smaller sizes (without increasing the overall memory size) to resolve the memory access conflicts by concurrent data-swapping between the banks. Synthesis result shows that the proposed structure with butterfly block of size 4 and 8 involves (~44% and ~57%) less area-delay product and (~54% and ~57%) less energy per sample than those of existing similar structure on average for different FFT lengths, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2018.2873720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8635013/08500740.pdf","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8635013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2018.2873720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area\u2013Delay\u2013Energy Efficient VLSI Architecture for Scalable In-Place Computation of FFT on Real Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Area\u2013Delay\u2013Energy Efficient VLSI Architecture for Scalable In-Place Computation of FFT on Real Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500740/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18453146","htmlLink":"/document/8500740/","volume":"66","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area\u2013Delay\u2013Energy Efficient VLSI Architecture for Scalable In-Place Computation of FFT on Real Data","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mohanty-2873720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096726S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8635013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8635013","articleId":"8500740","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500744,"authors":[{"name":"Congyin Shi","affiliation":["Google LLC, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8635013/8500744/shi-2873786-small.gif","p":["Congyin Shi (S\u201909) was born in Fuzhou, Fujian, China.

The proposed hybrid baseband chain consists of a continuous-time low-pass filter and a discrete-time (DT) finite impulse response filter with a compacted two-stage 3-tap harmonic cancellation (HC). This HC-3\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n architecture achieves notching at specific programmable frequency points. To estimate the filter linearity, two-tone test signals are injected, and the spectrum power of the DT filter's output is measured by a power detector. By changing the sampling frequency, the DT filter can switch between the normal operation mode, which allows the two test tones to pass through, or the tone suppression mode, which notches the two test tones and exposes the IM3 tone power. The proposed on-chip linearity estimation methodology is experimentally verified. A comparison between the power measured in the proposed two modes reveals how well is the filter linearity. The proposed baseband chain is fabricated in 130-nm standard CMOS technology, occupying a 0.146-mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n silicon area.

The approach allows the use of foundry cells, which are used in this paper, and requires very minor modifications to standard SRAM arrays. The PUF functionality is designed into large 1M-bit SRAM arrays fabricated on a 55-nm process using the foundry supplied SRAM cell layouts. The low variability foundry process produces good PUF results, demonstrating that the approach should also be good on conventional processes, since greater mismatch should positively impact PUF performance as measured by code word stability. The impact of process corners is also experimentally determined. Unstable bits, which we attribute to random telegraph noise is shown to be at manageable levels. We describe the circuit operation, statistical behavior, and suggest helper data functions that allow operation without error correction. This is important since error correction necessarily allows some leakage of the underlying secret codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","volume":"66","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"18434420","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8500746/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Physically Unclonable Functions Using Foundry SRAM Cells","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003393","fundingName":"Fujitsu"},{"fundingName":"Space Micro Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physically Unclonable Functions Using Foundry SRAM Cells","sourcePdf":"tcsi-clark-2873777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075505S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8635013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8635013","articleId":"8500746","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500751,"authors":[{"name":"Taehyun Yoon","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8500751/yoon-2876354-small.gif","p":["Taehyun Yoon received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National University, in 2005, 2007, and 2015, respectively.

To optimize the total transmit power for all users in the network, we investigate a comprehensive resource allocation solution consisting of joint subchannel assignments, user pairings, and power control. The optimization problem is a mixed integer linear program, which is solved in three low-complexity steps. We first group D2D users to minimize mutual interference from cellular users (CU). Second, we demonstrate a heuristic solution for coupling D2D users in each group. Finally, we minimize the total transmit power of all devices in the network while maintaining the SINR requirements for both CU and D2D users. The optimal solution is derived off-line using the Rayleigh fading channels for any given QoS level of CU and NOMA-D2D users. We recognize that both subchannel assignment and user pairings play the important roles in reducing the total transmit power of the network, in which both cellular and D2D users coexist. However, optimization of the subchannel assignment contributes more toward minimizing the total network transmit power than the proposed model of optimizing user pairings.","topic":"Advances in Interference Mitigation Techniques for Device-to-Device Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500751/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8500751/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for NOMA-Based D2D Systems Coexisting With Cellular Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003696","fundingName":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government","grantNumber":"18ZS1300 and 18AS1300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Resource Allocation for NOMA-Based D2D Systems Coexisting With Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"access-nguyen-2876354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.202444S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Advances in Interference Mitigation Techniques for Device-to-Device Communications"],"articleId":"8500751","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8500752,"authors":[{"name":"Jihwan Kim","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8613098/8500752/jkim-2874040-small.gif","p":["Jihwan Kim (S\u201907\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2005, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","His doctoral research focused on designing RF/millimeter-wave transceiver front-end ICs using CMOS/SiGe technologies.

We also investigate some of their properties in detail and show that they agree closely with simulated word error probabilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8500759/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18320989","volume":"17","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Form Word Error Rate Analysis for Successive Interference Cancellation Decoders","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11871248"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"21618329"},{"fundingName":"Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship from the Fonds de Recherche Nature et Technologies"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61661146003/NRF2016NRF-NSFC001-089"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"111-2-14"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Form Word Error Rate Analysis for Successive Interference Cancellation Decoders","sourcePdf":"twc-wen-2875699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130319S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8570921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8570921","articleId":"8500759","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8500763,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8570921/8500763/feng-2875740-small.gif","p":["Hao Feng (S\u201908\u2013M\u201918) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2017.

We consider the problem of optimal distribution of AgI services over a wireless computing network, in which nodes are equipped with both communication and computing resources. We characterize the wireless computing network capacity region and design a joint flow scheduling and resource allocation algorithm that stabilizes the underlying queuing system while achieving a network cost arbitrarily close to the minimum, with a tradeoff in network delay. Our solution captures the unique chaining and flow scaling aspects of AgI services while exploiting the use of the broadcast approach coding scheme over the wireless channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Control of Wireless Computing Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2875740","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8570921/08500763.pdf","startPage":"8283","endPage":"8298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2875740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8570921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8500763","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8570921/8500763-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8500763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Control of Wireless Computing Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8500763/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18321014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1619129"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100001017","fundingName":"California Community Foundation","grantNumber":"1423140"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Optimal Control of Wireless Computing Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-feng-2875740-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087193S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8570921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8570921","articleId":"8500763","onlineDate":"19 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501106,"authors":[{"name":"Marjan Urekar","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Marjan","lastName":"Urekar","id":"38295710600"},{"name":"Dragan Peji\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Peji\u0107","id":"37726634600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0974-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0973-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2130-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-0171"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0589-1485"}],"articleNumber":"8501106","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Energy measurement","Instruments","Threshold voltage","Time measurement","Hardware","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","comparators (circuits)","power grids","smart power grids","voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniform noise","input signal","finite time period","electrical energy","power grid","smart grid","4-bit stochastic flash ADC based instrument","low resolution stochastic flash ADC","time 180.0 s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Measurement","stochastic","flash ADC","dither","precision measurements","energy","voltage RMS","smart grid"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501106","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements (CPEM 2018)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482236/8500784/08501106.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPEM.2018.8501106","doi":"10.1109/CPEM.2018.8501106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8500784","publicationTitle":"2018 Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements (CPEM 2018)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Resolution Stochastic Flash ADC for High Precision Energy and RMS Voltage Measurements for Smart Grid","abstract":"This paper describes 4-bit Stochastic Flash ADC based instrument, with its low-resolution compensated by adding dither (uniform noise) to the input signal and calculation of the output average value over a finite time period, resulting in low part count, high sampling speed and low error.

Knowledge of the domain terminology is necessary for performing many Software Engineering tasks such as impact analysis, compliance verification, and safety certification. However, discovering domain terminology and reasoning about their interrelationships for highly technical software and system engineering domains is a complex task which requires significant domain expertise and human effort. In this paper, we present a novel approach for leveraging trace links in software intensive systems to guide the process of mining facts that contain domain knowledge. The trace links which drive our mining process, define relationships between artifacts such as regulations and requirements and enable a guided search through high-yield combinations of domain terms. Our proof-of-concept evaluation shows that our approach aids in the discovery of domain facts even in highly complex technical domains. These domain facts can provide support for a variety of Software Engineering activities. As a use case, we demonstrate how the mined facts can facilitate the task of project Q&A.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIRE.2018.00006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8501297","publicationTitle":"2018 5th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AIRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 5th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AIRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500730/8501297/08501303.pdf","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain Knowledge Discovery Guided by Software Trace Links","doi":"10.1109/AIRE.2018.00006","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Domain Knowledge Discovery Guided by Software Trace Links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501303/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18168627","publicationDate":"Aug 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8501303/","conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain Knowledge Discovery Guided by Software Trace Links","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"840400a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066716S","chronDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500730","isNumber":"8501297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500730","xplore-issue":"8501297","articleId":"8501303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8501310,"authors":[{"name":"Georgi M.

We also give a subjective logic-based method for deriving an ordering of the goals based on the amount of supporting and rebutting evidence in the discussions. Such an ordering can potentially be applied toward prioritizing goals for implementation.","doi":"10.1109/AIRE.2018.00013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIRE.2018.00013","publicationTitle":"2018 5th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AIRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 5th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AIRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500730/8501297/08501310.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8501297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Crowd-Informed Goal Models","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18183637","htmlLink":"/document/8501310/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"Aug 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowd-Informed Goal Models","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"840400a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087602S","chronDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500730","isNumber":"8501297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500730","xplore-issue":"8501297","articleId":"8501310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8501311,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Madala","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Madala","id":"37086057791"},{"name":"Shraddha Piparia","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas"],"firstName":"Shraddha","lastName":"Piparia","id":"37086502427"},{"name":"Hyunsook Do","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas"],"firstName":"Hyunsook","lastName":"Do","id":"37086056125"},{"name":"Renee Bryce","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas"],"firstName":"Renee","lastName":"Bryce","id":"37295828900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8404-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8405-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8501311","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding Component State Transition Model Elements Using Neural Networks: An Empirical Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501311","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Unified modeling language","Artificial neural networks","Data models","Natural languages","Computer architecture","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","natural language processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["component state transition model elements","component state transition diagram","use case documents","model generation","deep neural networks","neural network architecture","time consuming","writing specifications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Component State Transition Diagrams","Deep Neural Networks","Dependency Embeddings","Information Extraction"]}],"abstract":"Use cases are popular for writing specifications of a system. However, despite their semi-structured nature, it is often time consuming and error-prone to generate component state transition diagrams from use case documents as it is done manually. While attempts to automate model generation from requirements have increased with the advent of deep neural networks (DNNs), there are limited studies in which a neural network architecture successfully extracts information used to construct a component state transition diagram from use cases. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of four different neural network architectures using glove and dependency embeddings to find model elements of component state transition diagrams from use case descriptions. Our results from the study show that we may achieve performance equivalent to humans with F1-scores greater than 0.80 for each model element on test data.","doi":"10.1109/AIRE.2018.00014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIRE.2018.00014","publicationTitle":"2018 5th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AIRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 5th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AIRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8500730/8501297/08501311.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8501297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Finding Component State Transition Model Elements Using Neural Networks: An Empirical Study","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18168625","htmlLink":"/document/8501311/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"Aug 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding Component State Transition Model Elements Using Neural Networks: An Empirical Study","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"840400a054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133679S","chronDate":"21-21 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8500730","isNumber":"8501297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8500730","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8501297","articleId":"8501311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8501394,"authors":[{"name":"Jose V.

The used wireless network devices are nodes with several restrictions in terms of hardware, energy, and communication. Due to these limitations, the selection of the appropriated routing protocol represents an important task in order to seek an efficient network. Although the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is used in a great variety of smart city applications, recent studies have been identifying some drawbacks and limitations of this protocol. In this context, the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol (LOADng) can emerge as an important alternative to RPL. The LOADng is a reactive routing protocol continuously used and evaluated in various network scenarios, but its performance in a smart city network was not studied yet. Hence, this work presents a performance evaluation study considering the use of LOADng in a smart city scenario. The routing protocol was evaluated using different routing metrics aiming to define the most appropriated one for a smart city application. The LOADng and the various routing metrics described in the paper were evaluated considering the packet delivery ratio, latency, number of hops, spent energy per bit, and network energy consumption. The results express that LOADng can present an efficient performance in applications with constant periodical data messages, but it is decreased when the messages are sent sporadically.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476154/8501355/08501394.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE First Summer School on Smart Cities (S3C)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8501355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/S3C.2017.8501394","doi":"10.1109/S3C.2017.8501394","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE First Summer School on Smart Cities (S3C)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501394","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Routing protocols","Smart cities","Task analysis","Performance evaluation","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LOADng routing protocol","lightweight on-demand ad hoc distance-vector routing protocol","IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks","smart city network","reactive routing protocol","RPL","wireless network devices","pervasive network","ubiquitous network","wireless communications","network energy consumption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501394/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Assessment of the LOADng Routing Protocol in Smart City Scenarios","accessionNumber":"18183415","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","conferenceDate":"6-11 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Assessment of the LOADng Routing Protocol in Smart City Scenarios","confLoc":"Natal, Brazil","sourcePdf":"P2_09_IEEE_S3C_paper_74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045668S","chronDate":"6-11 Aug. 2017","isNumber":"8501355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476154","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8501394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8501398,"authors":[{"name":"Hugo B.

This can be obtained by operating in the weakly nonlinear regime, requiring a precise understanding of the transmission conditions. Ideally, optical transponders should be capable of estimating the regime of operation from the received signal and feeding that information to the upper management layers to optimize the transmission characteristics; however, this estimation is challenging. This paper addresses this problem by estimating the linear and nonlinear signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the received signal. This estimation is performed by obtaining features of two distinct effects: nonlinear phase noise and second-order statistical moments. A small neural network is trained to estimate the SNRs from the extracted features. Over extensive simulations covering 19,800 sets of realistic fiber transmissions, we verified the accuracy of the proposed techniques. Employing both approaches simultaneously gave measured performances of 0.04 and 0.20 dB of standard error for the linear and nonlinear SNRs, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine learning based linear and nonlinear noise estimation","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.10.000D42","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8501518/08501526.pdf","startPage":"D42","endPage":"D51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.10.000D42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8501518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Machine learning based linear and nonlinear noise estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18184615","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine learning based linear and nonlinear noise estimation","sourcePdf":"08_D42.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071499S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","isNumber":"8501518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"10","articleId":"8501526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8501527,"authors":[{"name":"Gagan Choudhury","affiliation":["AT&T Labs at 200 S.

The first one allows agile management of resources in a core IP/Optical network by using machine learning for short-term and long-term prediction of traffic flows. It also allows joint global optimization of IP and optical layers using colorless/directionless (CD) reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs). Multilayer coordination allows for significant cost savings, flexible new services to meet dynamic capacity needs, and improved robustness by being able to proactively adapt to new traffic patterns and network conditions. The second application is important as we migrate our networks to Open ROADM networks to allow physical routing without the need for detailed knowledge of optical parameters. We discuss a proof-of-concept study, where detailed performance data for established wavelengths in an existing ROADM network is used for machine learning to predict the optical performance of each wavelength. Both applications can be efficiently implemented by using a software-defined network controller.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.10.000D52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.10.000D52","startPage":"D52","endPage":"D62","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8501518/08501527.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8501518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two use cases of machine learning for SDN-enabled ip/optical networks: traffic matrix prediction and optical path performance prediction [Invited]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Two use cases of machine learning for SDN-enabled ip/optical networks: traffic matrix prediction and optical path performance prediction [Invited]","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2018","volume":"10","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18203319","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501527/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two use cases of machine learning for SDN-enabled ip/optical networks: traffic matrix prediction and optical path performance prediction [Invited]","sourcePdf":"09_D52.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071278S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","isNumber":"8501518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"18","articleId":"8501527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8501531,"authors":[{"name":"David Cote","affiliation":["Ciena Corporation, Ottawa, Ontario K2K 0L1, Canada"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cote"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"8501531","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1941},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501531","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication networks","Machine learning","Task analysis","Training","Optimized production technology","Big Data","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","telecommunication computing","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication networks","main machine learning concepts","concrete application","unsupervised machine learning","multiple network layers","optical layer","intelligent adaptive networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication networks; Cross layerdesign; Machine learning; Prediction methods; Softwaredefined networking."]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we first review how the main machine learning concepts can apply to communication networks.

In the MG scenario, users are uniformly distributed. Due to the small effective transmission range of relay user (RU), the cooperation is hindered, which limits the performance of CM. Therefore, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based two MGs joint cooperative opportunistic multicast scheme (termed as COM-NOMA) is proposed. In COM-NOMA scheme, two MGs are served as one quasi-MG. First, on the same frequency band, base station (BS) opportunistically multicasts the superposition signal, which is formed by two MGs' signals, to the users with good channel conditions in the two MGs using NOMA way. Second, some successfully receiving users are selected as RUs. The superposition signal is forwarded to the other users by Device-to-Device multicast way. Then, according to the coverage ratio of BS and the decode condition of NOMA, the signal to interference and noise ratio threshold for RU selection is given. Finally, the spectral efficiency of COM-NOMA is analyzed and the approximate expression of system coverage ratio is derived. The simulation results show that, spectral efficiency at unit transmit power (spectral efficiency per watt) and system coverage ratio is improved in comparison with other OFDMA-based CM schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"62793","endPage":"62805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOMA-Based Cooperative Opportunistic Multicast Transmission Scheme for Two Multicast Groups: Relay Selection and Performance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NOMA-Based Cooperative Opportunistic Multicast Transmission Scheme for Two Multicast Groups: Relay Selection and Performance Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18582951","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8501549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701038"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"NOMA-Based Cooperative Opportunistic Multicast Transmission Scheme for Two Multicast Groups: Relay Selection and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"access-yufang-2876598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092241S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501549","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501550,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Ouyang","affiliation":["Photonic System Group, Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Xing Ouyang (S\u201916\u2013M\u201918) received the M.Sc. degree\n in information science and engineering from Dalian Polytechnic University, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical and electronic engineering from Tyndall National Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland, in\n 2017.","During his Ph.D. degree, he was with the Photonic Systems Group, Tyndall National Institute, involved in advanced\n digital signal processing technology for next-generation fiber-optic communication.

By exploiting the pulse-compression property of the chirped waveforms, in this paper we propose a channel estimation algorithm compatible with the coherent optical (CO) OCDM system. In the proposed algorithm, a chirp from the orthogonal basis of the Fresnel transform is employed as the pilot signal. At the receiver, noise-rejection windowing is adopted in the Fresnel domain to remove the excessive noise after pulse compression, and then dispersions can be effectively compensated by efficient single-tap equalizers. It is shown that the proposed estimator is unbiased as long as the width of the noise-rejection window is wider than the maximum excess delay of the system. Moreover, the optimal window function achieving the minimum mean square error is derived in closed form. With these desired properties, it is shown that the proposed estimator outperforms conventional estimators, such as the intrasymbol frequency-domain average estimator, especially when the dispersion is severe. Finally, numerical results are provided to confirm the advantages of the CO-OCDM system with the proposed channel estimation algorithm.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8520944/08501550.pdf","startPage":"5600","endPage":"5610","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2877305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2877305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Channel Estimation for Coherent Optical Orthogonal Chirp-Division Multiplexing With Pulse Compression and Noise Rejection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2018","displayDocTitle":"Robust Channel Estimation for Coherent Optical Orthogonal Chirp-Division Multiplexing With Pulse Compression and Noise Rejection","htmlLink":"/document/8501550/","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18243418","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"23","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland","grantNumber":"12/IA/1270 and 12/RC/2276"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Channel Estimation for Coherent Optical Orthogonal Chirp-Division Multiplexing With Pulse Compression and Noise Rejection","sourcePdf":"jlt-ouyang-2877305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092281S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8520944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8520944","articleId":"8501550","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8501552,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Wai Chow","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Wai","lastName":"Chow","orcid":"0000-0002-7488-2611","id":"37277378700"},{"name":"Yen-Chun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086361797"},{"name":"Ruei-Jie Shiu","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ruei-Jie","lastName":"Shiu","id":"37086360706"},{"name":"Chien-Hung Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Photonics, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Hung","lastName":"Yeh","orcid":"0000-0002-1095-011X","id":"37085691069"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"8501552","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":728},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"307 KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/8496952/8501552/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2876798.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/8496952/8501552/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2876798.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gray-scale","Light emitting diodes","CMOS image sensors","Demodulation","Erbium","Wireless communication","Curve fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","error statistics","free-space optical communication","light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uneven light exposure","special thresholding schemes","modified adaptive scheme","bit-error-ratio measurements","CMOS image sensor","complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensor","rolling shutter pattern demodulation","high signal fluctuation","optical wireless communication","light-emitting-diode transmitter","visible light communication","rolling-shutter images","adaptive thresholding scheme","MQA scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Light emitting diode (LED)","visible light communication (VLC)","CMOS image sensor"]}],"abstract":"Light-emitting-diode transmitter and complementary-metal-oxide-semicon-ductor (CMOS) image sensor receiver based visible light communication is a promising scheme for an optical wireless communication.

The goal of the unsupervised-ADS is to detect unknown anomalous sounds without training data of anomalous sounds. The use of an AE as a normal model is a state-of-the-art technique for the unsupervised-ADS. To decrease the false positive rate (FPR), the AE is trained to minimize the reconstruction error of normal sounds, and the anomaly score is calculated as the reconstruction error of the observed sound. Unfortunately, since this training procedure does not take into account the anomaly score for anomalous sounds, the true positive rate (TPR) does not necessarily increase. In this study, we define an objective function based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma by considering the ADS as a statistical hypothesis test. The proposed objective function trains the AE to maximize the TPR under an arbitrary low FPR condition. To calculate the TPR in the objective function, we consider that the set of anomalous sounds is the complementary set of normal sounds and simulate anomalous sounds by using a rejection sampling algorithm. Through experiments using synthetic data, we found that the proposed method improved the performance measures of the ADS under low FPR conditions. In addition, we confirmed that the proposed method could detect anomalous sounds in real environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501554/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"27","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18278488","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501554/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Sound Based on Deep Learning and the Neyman\u2013Pearson Lemma","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Sound Based on Deep Learning and the Neyman\u2013Pearson Lemma","sourcePdf":"taslp-koizumi-2877258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090977S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8471003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8471003","articleId":"8501554","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501558,"authors":[{"name":"Malik Najmus Siraj","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Studies in Engineering, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501558/siraj-2875952-small.gif","p":["Malik Najmus Siraj received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology Taxila in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

Software defined networking (SDN) is the key technology behind this shift. This new paradigm not only proves the ease of network management in wired networks but also results into graceful evolution of networking protocols. Moreover, wireless distributed networks (WDNs) and software defined radios (SDRs) are also shifting towards the centralized approach. However, due to distributed control nature of WDNs, already prevailing routing algorithms cannot cope the design principle of centralized routing algorithms. Hence, a new routing algorithm that incorporates SDN in WDNs is required. In this paper, we propose a logically centralized approach for WDNs called centralized approach to mobile ad hoc network (CATMAN). It is a self-healing and hybrid routing protocol. It combines distributed and logically centralized network control along with the flavors of reactive, proactive, and opportunistic routing protocols. CATMAN is designed to automatically switch between logically centralized routing protocol and distributed routing protocol based on the types of available network nodes. The protocol significantly reduces control overhead and hence improves bandwidth utilization. While route computations, this protocol deliberately avoids the nodes with weaker batteries, optimizing the effective life of whole network. The simulation results showed that the CATMAN protocol outperform better approach to mobile ad hoc network (BATMAN) protocol by signaling overhead reduction up to 570%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8501558/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","publicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Routing Protocol for Wireless Distributed Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Center for Advanced Studies in Engineering, Islamabad, Pakistan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Hybrid Routing Protocol for Wireless Distributed Networks","sourcePdf":"access-siraj-2875952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084622S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501558","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8501559,"authors":[{"name":"Olga Vassilieva","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Olga Vassilieva (M\u201904\u2013SM\u201918) received the M.S. degree in physics from the Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in physics from The University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA, in 1999.","From 2000 to 2002, she was with Fujitsu Network Communications, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA.

In this paper, we discuss various nonlinearity mitigation techniques in electrical and optical domains. In electrical domain, multiple reduced complexity digital back-propagation algorithms were developed, including perturbation back-propagation. One drawback is that they can compensate for intra-channel self-phase modulation (SPM) effects only. The inter-channel fiber nonlinearity mitigation can be done in optical domain. For example, digital subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) can effectively mitigate both SPM and cross-phase modulation (XPM) effects. It can become even more beneficial for higher symbol rate systems (e.g., 64 Gbaud and 128 Gbaud) and has a capability to deliver longer reach than single carrier 32 Gbaud DP-16QAM signals and only slightly shorter reach (by up to 7%) compared to 32 Gbaud SCM systems. Another technique, the total intensity directed phase modulation, can provide per-span SPM and XPM compensation. However, this technique is limited to compensation of a few channels only. On the other hand, the proposed enhanced pre-dispersed spectral inversion can effectively compensate for SPM/XPM effects of multiple channels and become more practical by removing limitation to link symmetry even in nonuniform transmission links. Finally, subcarrier power pre-emphasis in optical superchannels can equalize performance of all subcarriers by mitigating intersubcarrier XPM and extend transmission reach by 20%.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2877310","startPage":"50","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2877310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8632872","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8632872/08501559.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Technologies for Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation in High Capacity Transmission Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501559/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enabling Technologies for Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation in High Capacity Transmission Systems","volume":"37","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8501559/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18438782","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2019","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Technologies for Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation in High Capacity Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-vassilieva-2877310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103328S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8632872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8632872","articleId":"8501559","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":8501562,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Shrestha","affiliation":["School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Mandi, India"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Shrestha","orcid":"0000-0003-2224-0892","id":"37851402200"},{"name":"Abhijit Sahoo","affiliation":["School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Mandi, India"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Sahoo","orcid":"0000-0002-1557-8003","id":"37086873456"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8501562","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":643},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501562","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Delays","Computer architecture","Throughput","Clocks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-efficient successive cancellation polar-decoder","logarithmic likelihood ratios","critical path delay","low complexity algorithm","p-node architecture","SC polar decoder-architecture","PE architectures","UMC CMOS process","high-speed successive cancellation polar-decoder","word length 1024.0 bit","frequency 446.0 MHz","size 180 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar code","successive-cancellation polar decoding","channel encoder & decoder","digital architectures","application-specific integrated-circuit (ASIC)","very-large scale-integration (VLSI) design"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents an algorithm for the processing element (PE) of polar decoder based on 2's complement representation of logarithmic likelihood ratios.

However, it cannot be used to analyze raptor-like LDPC code as it cannot describe the most important structural feature of raptor-like LDPC code, which is that any check node is connected to at most one degree-one variable node. In this paper, we propose a two-type degree distribution framework for raptor-like LDPC code. The proposed framework can describe the special structural feature of raptor-like LDPC code by dividing the check nodes into two different sets. One is the set of check nodes connected to those degree-one variable nodes, the other is the set of check nodes unconnected to those degree-one variable nodes. Furthermore, we propose a two-type discrete density evolution algorithm and a two-type Gaussian approximation density evolution algorithm based on the proposed two-type degree distribution framework to estimate the threshold of raptor-like LDPC code. During the decoding analysis, the proposed algorithms treat the check nodes belonging the two separate sets differently. Compared with the traditional multi-edge type (MET) algorithm, the proposed algorithms allow us to calculate the threshold more quickly without much sacrifice in accuracy. For some raptor-like LDPC codes adopted by the Advanced Television Systems Committee 3.0 (ATSC3.0) standard, the thresholds estimated by the proposed algorithms can be very close to the thresholds estimated by the traditional MET algorithm. The deviations are less than 0.07 dB. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithms can tremendously reduce the computation complexity because of the two-type degree distribution framework and the Gaussian approximation.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2877134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8577058/08501569.pdf","startPage":"11900","endPage":"11912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2877134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Density Evolution Based on Two-Type Degree Distribution Framework of Raptor-Like LDPC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Density Evolution Based on Two-Type Degree Distribution Framework of Raptor-Like LDPC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501569/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18344978","htmlLink":"/document/8501569/","volume":"67","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601286, 61671297 and 61420106008"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2015AA015802"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing","grantNumber":"STCSM15DZ2270400"},{"fundingName":"111 Program","grantNumber":"B07022"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2017ZX03001027"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density Evolution Based on Two-Type Degree Distribution Framework of Raptor-Like LDPC","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2877134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116903S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8501569","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501570,"authors":[{"name":"He Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8572808/8501570/hzhu-2873342-small.gif","p":["He Zhu received the B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Global Big Data Technologies Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia.

Unlike previously published ones, the proposed designs use a \u201ccell-based\u201d approach, which utilizes identical broadside-coupled resonators (BCRs) with series and shunt capacitors. The capacitors are mainly used as J-inverters to achieve the desired frequency responses. To fully understand the operational mechanism of the presented approach, both the BCR and BPFs are analyzed using the simplified LC-equivalent circuit models. To prove the concept, both BPFs are implemented in a standard 0.13-\u03bcm silicon-germanium bipolar complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. According to the on-wafer measurement results, the BPFs exhibit the excellent performance including flat in-band responses with relatively large harmonic suppression. The first design has a 1-dB bandwidth from 23.9 to 39.7 GHz with an insertion loss of 3.9 dB at the center frequency of 31 GHz. The stopband attenuation is better than 45 dB at 58 GHz. The 1-dB bandwidth of the second design covers from 26.7 to 44.3 GHz with an insertion loss of 3.1 dB at the center frequency of 35 GHz, and stopband attenuation up to 35 dB is achieved at 59 GHz.

In this work, we introduce a hybrid framework to improve the performance of lattice reduction (LR) aided precoding in VP. First, we perform a simple precoding using zero forcing (ZF) or successive interference cancellation (SIC) based on a reduced lattice basis. Since the signal space after LR-ZF or LR-SIC precoding can be shown to be bounded to a small range, then along with sufficient orthogonality of the lattice basis guaranteed by LR, they collectively pave the way for the subsequent application of an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, which further boosts the performance of any suboptimal precoder. Our work shows that the AMP algorithm can be beneficial for a lattice decoding problem whose data symbols lie in integers \u2124 and entries of the lattice basis may not be i.i.d. Gaussian. Numerical results confirm that the low-complexity AMP algorithm can improve the symbol error rate performance of LR-aided precoding significantly. Finally, the hybrid scheme is also proven effective when solving the data detection problem of massive MIMO systems without using LR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Vector Perturbation Precoding: The Blessing of Approximate Message Passing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2877205","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8541135/08501573.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2877205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8541135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Vector Perturbation Precoding: The Blessing of Approximate Message Passing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8501573/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2018","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2019","accessionNumber":"18281641","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Vector Perturbation Precoding: The Blessing of Approximate Message Passing","sourcePdf":"tsp-ling-2877205-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118955S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8541135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8541135","articleId":"8501573","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501584,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8577058/8501584/liu-2877265-small.gif","p":["Jun Liu (S\u201911\u2013M\u201913\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006, the M.S. degree in mathematics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012.","From July 2012 to December 2012, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.

In this framework, each microgrid not only schedules its local hybrid biogas-solar-wind renewables for coupled multicarrier energy supplies based on the concept of energy hub but also exchanges energy with interconnected microgrids and via the transactive market. The multimicrogrid scheduling is a challenging optimization problem due to its severe constraints and strong couplings. A multimicrogrid multienergy coupling matrix is thus formulated to model and exploit the inherent biogas-solar-wind energy couplings among electricity, gas, and heat flows. Furthermore, a distributed stochastic optimal scheduling scheme with minimum information exchange overhead is proposed to dynamically optimize energy conversion and storage devices in the multimicrogrid system. The proposed method has been fully tested and benchmarked on the different scaled multimicrogrid system over a 24-h scheduling horizon. Comparative results demonstrated that the proposed approach can reduce the system operating cost and enhance the system energy-efficiency, and also confirm its scalability in solving large-scale multimicrogrid problems.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2018.2877143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8736410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2018.2877143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8736410/08501585.pdf","startPage":"3254","endPage":"3266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Multienergy Coordination of Multimicrogrids With Biogas-Solar-Wind Renewables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Multienergy Coordination of Multimicrogrids With Biogas-Solar-Wind Renewables","volume":"15","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8501585/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18741028","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501585/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51877072 and 51507056"},{"fundingName":"Hunan Strategic Industries Scientific and Technological Project","grantNumber":"2017GK4028"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Basic Research Project"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK20180284"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"3174057"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Multienergy Coordination of Multimicrogrids With Biogas-Solar-Wind Renewables","sourcePdf":"tii-zhou-2877143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15791S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8736410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8736410","articleId":"8501585","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501590,"authors":[{"name":"Ryo Hayakawa","affiliation":["Kyoto Daigaku, Kyoto, JP"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8519803/8501590/hayak-2877170-small.gif","p":["Ryo Hayakawa (S\u201916) received the Bachelor's degree in\n engineering and the Master's degree in informatics from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2015 and 2017,\n respectively.

The proposed algorithm, referred to as discreteness-aware approximate message passing (DAMP), is based on the idea of approximate message passing (AMP), which has been originally proposed for compressed sensing. The DAMP algorithm has low computational complexity and its performance in the large system limit can be predicted analytically via state evolution framework, where we provide a condition for the exact reconstruction with DAMP in the noise-free case. From the analysis, we also propose a method to determine the parameters of the SOAV optimization. Moreover, based on the state evolution, we provide Bayes optimal DAMP, which has the minimum mean-square-error at each iteration of the algorithm. Simulation results show that the DAMP algorithms can reconstruct the discrete-valued vector from underdetermined linear measurements and the empirical performance agrees with our theoretical results in large-scale systems. When the problem size is not large enough, the SOAV optimization with the proposed parameters can achieve better performance than the DAMP algorithms for high signal-to-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2877170","startPage":"6443","endPage":"6457","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8519803/08501590.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2877170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8519803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discreteness-Aware Approximate Message Passing for Discrete-Valued Vector Reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Signal processing algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Message passing","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","compressed sensing","expectation-maximisation algorithm","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","mean square error methods","message passing","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-valued random vector","discrete-valued vector reconstruction","Bayes optimal DAMP","SOAV optimization","exact reconstruction","DAMP algorithm","discreteness-aware approximate message passing","sum-of-absolute-value optimization","possibly underdetermined linear measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete-valued vector reconstruction","sum-of-absolute-value optimization","approximate message passing","state evolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","displayDocTitle":"Discreteness-Aware Approximate Message Passing for Discrete-Valued Vector Reconstruction","volume":"66","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/8501590/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18213539","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific","grantNumber":"15K06064, 15H02252, 18K04148 and 18H03765"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan","grantNumber":"17J07055"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discreteness-Aware Approximate Message Passing for Discrete-Valued Vector Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tsp-hayakawa-2877170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132984S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8519803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8519803","articleId":"8501590","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":8501593,"authors":[{"name":"Mahendra K.

We employ user selection coupled with antenna selection (AS) scheme at the BS so as to maximize the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratios. In the considered system, by employing two possible combining techniques at the eavesdropper, viz., maximum ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC), we derive the novel tight closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) under Rayleigh fading channels. We present an asymptotic secrecy diversity order analysis of the considered system for the large transmit power, and demonstrate that the eavesdropping reduces the secrecy diversity order from min(N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>\n, K) to 1. Further, we present some useful insights into the impact of eavesdropper and number of antennas and users on the SOP performance. It is shown that the eavesdropper has a severe impact on the SOP performance, regardless of number of antennas and users. The numerical and simulation results corroborate our theoretical findings, and demonstrate the influence of eavesdropper and relay positions on the SOP performance. We show that the SOP performance improves significantly when the eavesdropper is far away from the BS and USs. It is also shown that the SOP performance enhances noticeably if the relay location is chosen optimally, for different eavesdropper positions and/or different values of antennas and users. Moreover, our results also reveal that only coding gain rather than diversity gain is achieved by increasing N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>\n and K, because of the dominance of information leakage by the first time phase.

However, existing searchable encryption (SE) schemes just apply to IIoT records containing textual keyword fields rather than both digital and textual keyword ones. Besides, the key management issue still impedes the practicality and availability of SE schemes due to high key storage overhead. To this end, we present an outsourced Hybrid Keyword-Field Search over encrypted data with efficient Keys Management (HKFS-KM) scheme by utilizing the relevance score function and keyed hash tree. Formal security analysis proves that the HKFS-KM scheme can achieve keyword privacy and trapdoor unlinkability in both known ciphertexts attack model and known background attack model. Experimental results using real-world dataset show its efficiency and practicality in practice.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Keyword-Field Search With Efficient Key Management for Industrial Internet of Things","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2018.2877146","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8736410/08501594.pdf","startPage":"3206","endPage":"3217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2018.2877146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8736410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Keyword-Field Search With Efficient Key Management for Industrial Internet of Things","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8501594/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18740996","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702404, 61702105, 61472310 and 61672413"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M613080"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB171504"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201806965010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Keyword-Field Search With Efficient Key Management for Industrial Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tii-m-2877146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139038S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8736410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8736410","articleId":"8501594","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501595,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9224203/8501595/sli-2870724-small.gif","p":["Shu Li received the B.S. degree in information and computing science and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from the Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

With the typical model of the WMR transformed into an affine nonlinear DT system, a delay matrix function and appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are introduced to overcome the problems caused by the state and input time delays, respectively. Furthermore, with the approximation of the radial basis function neural networks (NNs), the adaptive controller, the critic NN, and action NN adaptive laws are defined to guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the WMR system, and the tracking errors convergence to a small compact set to zero. Two examples of simulation are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501595/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"20034839","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8501595/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Neural Network-Based Adaptive Control for State and Input Time-Delayed Wheeled Mobile Robots","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51822502"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51521003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HIT.BRETIV.201903"},{"fundingName":"\u201c111 Project\u201d","grantNumber":"B07018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning Neural Network-Based Adaptive Control for State and Input Time-Delayed Wheeled Mobile Robots","sourcePdf":"tsmc-ding-2870724-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114207S","chronDate":"Nov.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9224203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9224203","articleId":"8501595","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8501597,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shi","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8519803/8501597/shi-2877193-small.gif","p":["Jun Shi (M\u201914) received the B.E. degree in communication\n engineering from Hohai University, Nanjing, China, in 2006, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in information and\n communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2008 and 2013,\n respectively.","From September 2011 to March 2012, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Electrical and Computer\n Engineering, University of Delaware, DE, USA.

Many of its fundamental properties are already known; however, little attention has been paid to the design and implementation of matched filters in the LCT domain. The objective of this paper is to design this type of filters that maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio, dubbed the linear canonical matched filter (LCMF). We first derive some facts of the LCT spectral analysis for random signals. Then, by applying the derived results, the LCMF design theory associated with the LCT is developed.

Under the new electricity market environment, it is of great significance to build a win-win situation for prosumers and the hub manager (HM) at the community level without bringing extra burden to the utility grid. This paper proposes a cooperative trading mode for a community-level energy system (CES), which consists of the energy hub and PV prosumers with the automatic demand response (DR) capability. In the cooperative trading framework, a real-time rolling horizon energy management model is proposed based on cooperative game theory considering the stochastic characteristics of PV prosumers and the conditional value at risk (CVaR). The validity of the proposed model is analyzed through optimality proof of the grand coalition. A contribution-based profit distribution scheme and its stability proof are also provided. Moreover, in order to solve the optimization model, it is further transformed into a more easily resolved mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model by adding auxiliary variables. Finally, via a practical example, the effectiveness of the model is verified in terms of promoting local consumption of PV energy, increasing HM's profits, and reducing prosumers' costs, etc.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2877236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8643660/08501599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2877236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643660","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Rolling Horizon Energy Management for the Energy-Hub-Coordinated Prosumer Community From a Cooperative Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Rolling Horizon Energy Management for the Energy-Hub-Coordinated Prosumer Community From a Cooperative Perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18470761","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501599/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51877076"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Grid-connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES)","grantNumber":"Award GR-17-14"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Rolling Horizon Energy Management for the Energy-Hub-Coordinated Prosumer Community From a Cooperative Perspective","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-liu-2877236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101438S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8643660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8643660","articleId":"8501599","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8501603,"authors":[{"name":"Jairo Quiros-Tortos","affiliation":["Universidad de Costa Rica, San Jose, San Jos\u00c3\u00a9, CR"],"bio":{"p":["Jairo Quir\u00f3s-Tort\u00f3s is with the University of Costa Rica, San Jose."]},"firstName":"Jairo","lastName":"Quiros-Tortos","orcid":"0000-0002-3329-8910","id":"37085730804"},{"name":"Luis Ochoa","affiliation":["The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, AU"],"bio":{"p":["Luis (Nando) Ochoa is with the University of Melbourne, Australia, and the University of Manchester, United Kingdom."]},"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Ochoa","id":"37272308100"},{"name":"Timothy Butler","affiliation":["EA Technology Ltd, Capenhurst, Cheshire, GB"],"bio":{"p":["Timothy Butler is with EA Technology, Chester, United Kingdom."]},"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Butler","id":"37085813660"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1540-7977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4216"}],"articleNumber":"8501603","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1745},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/pes/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501603","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Economics","Automobiles","Electric vehicle charging","Substations","Histograms","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","power generation economics","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle trials","low-carbon electricity generation portfolio","Global EV Outlook 2017","current EV fleet","plug-in hybrids","EVs","grid work"]}],"abstract":"In the coming years, hundreds of thousands of new electric vehicles (EVs), from plug-in hybrids to fully electric, will hit the roads around the world, adding to the current EV fleet of more than 2 million, according to the Global EV Outlook 2017.

Companies that are able to analyze the current state of their processes, forecast its most optimal progress and proactively control them basing on reliable predictions will stay significantly ahead their competitors. This result can be achieved by embedding predictive analytics systems, such systems allow to prevent emergencies and optimize existing processes on the basis of historical process data. The analysis and processing of process signals are at the heart of these systems. These tasks are reduced to a number of other subtasks, one of the most important of them is the detection of a change point in the process signals. Change points are abrupt variations in process signals. Such abrupt changes may represent transitions that occur between states of equipment or process stages. The paper proposes the application of the cascade classification of time series approach for detecting the region of a changepoint in process signals. It is assumed that this approach to the refinement of the moment of a changepoint is more suitable for signals characterizing the different flow stages of the processes. The rationale for using this approach in the field of automated control systems is presented, the results of experiments performed on model data with different levels of noise are demonstrated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8501604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RUSAUTOCON.2018.8501677","publicationTitle":"2018 International Russian Automation Conference (RusAutoCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Russian Automation Conference (RusAutoCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484862/8501604/08501677.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/RUSAUTOCON.2018.8501677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Change Point in Process Signals by Cascade Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-16 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Change Point in Process Signals by Cascade Classification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-16 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8501677/","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18168375","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501677/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Change Point in Process Signals by Cascade Classification","confLoc":"Sochi, Russia","sourcePdf":"5596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047026S","chronDate":"9-16 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484862","isNumber":"8501604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484862","xplore-issue":"8501604","articleId":"8501677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":8501692,"authors":[{"name":"Anton I.

A comparative modeling for all developed controllers is conducted using the robot mathematical model. Its results show that application of the neural network controller with the online training allows to reduce the energy consumption to stabilize the robot by 30.4% and 27.9% in comparison with the LQR-controller and the PID-controller respectively.

The paper proposes the use of a neural network-based estimator for the reaction forces allowing the simplification of the mentioned control problem. Two architectures of the neural network are proposed, both are based on fully connected layers with rectified linear unit activation functions. The generation of the training dataset for the network is discussed. It is shown that the trained network is capable of accurately predicting the values of normal reactions using the values of generalized coordinates and velocities, as well as control actions as inputs. The predictions demonstrate a constant offset, which we refer to as the static prediction error. The paper presents some possible use cases for the designed reaction estimator.","doi":"10.1109/RUSAUTOCON.2018.8501736","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 International Russian Automation Conference (RusAutoCon)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RUSAUTOCON.2018.8501736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8501604","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Russian Automation Conference (RusAutoCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484862/8501604/08501736.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network-Based Reaction Estimator for Walking Robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501736/","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network-Based Reaction Estimator for Walking Robots","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18168397","publicationDate":"September 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2018","conferenceDate":"9-16 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-16 Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network-Based Reaction Estimator for Walking Robots","confLoc":"Sochi, Russia","sourcePdf":"5688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034218S","chronDate":"9-16 Sept. 2018","isNumber":"8501604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484862","citationCount":"4","articleId":"8501736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8501737,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Makarov","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Applied mathematics, Vladimir State University, Vladimir, Russia"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Makarov","id":"37085412092"},{"name":"Anton Kuryshov","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Applied mathematics, Vladimir State University, Vladimir, Russia"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Kuryshov","id":"37086130856"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4938-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4939-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8501737","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Monitoring","Computer architecture","Decision making","Biological neural networks","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","decision making","fault tolerant computing","neural nets","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network decision-making component","robotics system","information processing","parameters variations","fault-tolerant architecture","destabilizing impacts","computed path control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault tolerance","artificial neural network","reliability","decision-making components","robotics systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501737","abstract":"This article proposes and investigates a method of optimizing the reliability of robotics systems designed via the use of the neural network components of information processing.

The best neural-fuzzy ship collision prevention systems' testing has proved to be able of evaluating the value of changing the ship - operator's route very accurately to avoid ship collision in a heavy traffic zone.

It is found that steep SS can be understood as a transient phenomenon and is present when significant polarization changes occur. The experimental signature of the TNC is investigated, and guidelines for detecting it in measured data are outlined.

These vertical interconnects enable design of high performance 3D Network-on-Chip (NoC) as a communication backbone for massive manycore platforms. However, existing 3D NoCs are still bottlenecked due to simple extension of 2D architectures without fully exploiting the advantages of the 3D integration. Moreover, the anticipated performance gain of 3D NoC-enabled manycore chips will be compromised due to potential failures of through silicon vias (TSVs) that are predominantly used as vertical interconnects. To address these problems, we explore a holistic design methodology starting from the physical layer to the overall interconnection architecture where the vertical data exchange takes place through contactless links using near field inductive coupling (NFIC).","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8501894","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8167715/8203744/08501894.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8501894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8203744","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient and robust 3D NoCs with contactless vertical links (Invited paper)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient and robust 3D NoCs with contactless vertical links (Invited paper)","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreNote":"This article was mistakenly omitted from the original submission to IEEE Xplore.

In the proposed scheme, the secondary users harvest energy from the radio-frequency signals to securely transmit the secondary privacy information with the NOMA technique. Unlike the conventional ideal linear energy harvesting, we employ the practical nonlinear energy harvesting model for energy harvesting. To implement the proposed scheme, the energy transmitter first broadcasts radio-frequency signals to power the secondary users. Then, the secondary users employ the NOMA technique to transmit the uplink privacy information, which is threatened by the eavesdropper. Considering two scenarios: two secondary users and more than two secondary users, we first provide comprehensive analysis of the secondary secrecy performances and derive the closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability for both scenarios. Following the above analysis, we develop the optimization problems to optimally allocate the time slot and the secondary transmit power such that the minimum secrecy energy efficiency is maximized under the constraints of the transmission security and reliability requirements. A two-stage algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the above optimization problems. Numerical results are presented to verify the analysis in terms of the secrecy rate and secrecy energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501901.pdf","startPage":"62707","endPage":"62716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Energy Efficiency for NOMA Based Cognitive Radio Networks With Nonlinear Energy Harvesting","topic":"Wirelessly Powered Networks Algorithms, Applications and Technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Secure Energy Efficiency for NOMA Based Cognitive Radio Networks With Nonlinear Energy Harvesting","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18582953","htmlLink":"/document/8501901/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"31020180QD095 and 31020170QD091"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BX20180262"},{"fundingName":"Medical Science and Technology Research Foundation of Guangdong","grantNumber":"B2018108"},{"fundingName":"Youth Creative Talent Project (Natural Science) of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2017KQNCX041"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Secure Energy Efficiency for NOMA Based Cognitive Radio Networks With Nonlinear Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2876970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082581S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Wirelessly Powered Networks Algorithms, Applications and Technologies"],"articleId":"8501901","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501905,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Alfonso Boh\u00f3rquez Camargo","affiliation":["Faculdade de Engenharia El\u00e9trica e de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501905/bohor-2877364-small.gif","p":["Claudio Alfonso Boh\u00f3rquez Camargo was born in Chiquinquir\u00e1, Boyac\u00e1, Colombia.

In this paper, we consider such energy harvesting (EH) devices operating in a two-tier orthogonal frequency-division multiple access-based heterogeneous network. Critically, we investigate how such EH devices can be supported alongside non-RF harvesting or legacy devices. Our aim is to minimize the downlink sum transmit power of both femto and macro base stations and ensure that legacy and EH devices receive a given data rate and amount of energy, respectively. Critically, we study sub-carrier and power allocation to both types of devices and investigate novel questions related to interference, which reduces network capacity but improves the amount of harvested energy by EH devices. To study these questions, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and propose three linear approximations to the MINLP where devices are either assigned one or multiple sub-carriers. Numerical results show that EH devices will not affect network capacity if they can harvest sufficient energy from data transmissions to legacy devices. In addition, if multiple sub-carriers can be assigned to devices, our results show that the sum transmit power decreases by approximately 15% as compared with assigning a single sub-carrier to these devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501909.pdf","startPage":"62538","endPage":"62551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Supporting Legacy and RF Energy Harvesting Devices in Two-Tier OFDMA Heterogeneous Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Interference","Resource management","Radio frequency","Power control","Energy harvesting","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","integer programming","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF energy harvesting devices","radio-frequency signals","EH devices","nonRF harvesting","network capacity","harvested energy","OFDMA heterogeneous networks","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access-based heterogeneous network","mixed-integer non-linear program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-tier","resource allocation","sub-carrier","transmit power","macro base stations","femto base stations","OFDMA","heterogeneous networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"On Supporting Legacy and RF Energy Harvesting Devices in Two-Tier OFDMA Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8501909/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18582956","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004681","fundingName":"Higher Education Commission, Pakistan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On Supporting Legacy and RF Energy Harvesting Devices in Two-Tier OFDMA Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"access-sarwar-2876914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11197S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501909","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501910,"authors":[{"name":"Haya R.

Current PoD systems are mostly centralized and heavily dependent on a trusted third party (TTP) especially for payment. Such existing PoD systems often lack security, transparency, and visibility, and are not highly credible, as the TTP can be subject to failure, manipulation, corruption, compromise, and hacking. In this paper, we propose a decentralized PoD solution for PoD of digital assets. Our solution leverages key features of blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts to provide immutable and tamper-proof logs, accountability, and traceability. Ethereum smart contracts are used to orchestrate and govern all interactions and transactions including automatic payments in Ether cryptocurrency between customers, digital-content provider, and the file server hosting the digital content. All entities are incentivized to act honestly, and our solution has a mechanism to handle dispute if arisen among participants. The solution has an off-chain secure download phase involving the file server and customers. Moreover, our solution leverages the benefits of interplanetary file system to store the agreed upon terms and conditions between the smart contract actors. A security analysis of our proposed system has been provided. The full code of the smart contract has been publicly made available on Github.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Media","Videos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contracts","electronic money","file servers","security of data","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain","digital media","current PoD systems","trusted third party","TTP","decentralized PoD solution","Ethereum smart contracts","tamper-proof logs","automatic payments","digital-content provider","off-chain secure download phase","interplanetary file system","smart contract actors","security analysis","digital asset","proof of delivery","Ether cryptocurrency","file server hosting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","Ethereum","smart contracts","proof of delivery","digital content"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501910","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876971","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501910.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876971","startPage":"65439","endPage":"65448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proof of Delivery of Digital Assets Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Proof of Delivery of Digital Assets Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501910/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8501910/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495553","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Proof of Delivery of Digital Assets Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts","sourcePdf":"access-salah-2876971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057846S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501910","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501913,"authors":[{"name":"Jehad M.

Particularly, in highly dispersive channels, CP rate might be very large in order to maintain the low-complex frequency-domain equalization. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can fit the low latency and high spectral efficiency requirements of future 5G wireless services by eliminating the need for inserting CP between successive OFDM symbols while keeping the whole detection process the same at the receiver side. In order to achieve that, we utilize specially designed alignment signals that can cancel the interference of one symbol on the other and add an additional signal component that makes the signal circularly convolved with the channel at the receiver side. Simulation results prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of enhancing spectral and power efficiency, reducing latency, and improving physical-layer security against eavesdropping while using a low-complexity one-tap frequency-domain equalizer. These numerous, simultaneous, and desirable advantages have the potential to make the proposed technique a suitable fit for future 5G wireless services and applications including Internet of Things-based massive machine-type communication, ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, and enhanced mobile broadband.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","accessionNumber":"18495555","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8501913/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CP-Less OFDM With Alignment Signals for Enhancing Spectral Efficiency, Reducing Latency, and Improving PHY Security of 5G Services","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"CP-Less OFDM With Alignment Signals for Enhancing Spectral Efficiency, Reducing Latency, and Improving PHY Security of 5G Services","sourcePdf":"access-hamamreh-2877321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146509S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501913","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501914,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Liu","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501914/liu-2877018-small.gif","p":["Zhe Liu received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the Chengdu Institute of Meteorology, Chengdu, China, in 1999, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2002 and 2009, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for the MTI (CNN-MTI) to overcome the limitations of these methods. In the proposed method, the CNN architecture is deliberately designed, and the training data set is greatly augmented to ensure the CNN be deep and well-trained; in addition, the SD only act as the background interference during the augmentation of the training data set. These procedures ensure that the effective features of different classes of moving targets can be extracted, so that good MTI performance can be achieved without the requirement of the sufficient and homogeneous SD or the high SCR condition. Simulation results from the synthetic data and the experimental data demonstrate the validity and the robustness of the CNN-MTI with limited SD support in non-homogeneous and low SCR environment.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877018","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501914.pdf","startPage":"65651","endPage":"65660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving Target Indication Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Moving Target Indication Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18495556","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8501914/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Central University Fund","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016J033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771113"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Moving Target Indication Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2877018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11216S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501914","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8501915,"authors":[{"name":"James Kweku Nkrumah Nyarko","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501915/nyark-2877139-small.gif","p":["James Kweku Nkrumah Nyarko received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from Ghana Technology University College in 2011.

The information blocks of inner polar codes are split into several information sub-blocks, and several segment successive cancellation list (S-SCL) decoders are carried out in parallel for all inner polar codes. Moreover, for a better error-correcting performance, an improved SCL decoder with a selective extension is proposed for the concatenated polar codes, which will be referred to selective extended segment SCL (SES-SCL) decoder. The SES-SCL decoder uses soft information of some unreliable information sub-blocks for the decoding of subsequent sub-blocks so as to mitigate the error propagation of premature hard decision of S-SCL decoder. Simulation results show that NBLDPC-polar codes can outperform Reed Solomon -polar codes. The NBLDPC-polar codes with the proposed SES-SCL algorithm can also be comparable with pure polar codes with cyclic redundancy check aided successive cancellation list (CA-SCL) decoding with list size L = 4 in the high SNR, but require lower decoding storage. Therefore, the NBLDPC-polar codes may strike a better balance between memory space and performance compared with the state-of-the-art schemes in the finite length regime.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501923.pdf","startPage":"65088","endPage":"65097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Concatenations of Polar Codes and Non-Binary LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"On the Concatenations of Polar Codes and Non-Binary LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501923/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18495560","htmlLink":"/document/8501923/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671128 and 61601414"},{"fundingName":"Henan Scientific and Technological Research Project","grantNumber":"182102210307"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"010403302/CUC18A007-2 and 3132018XNG1808"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Concatenations of Polar Codes and Non-Binary LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"access-yu-2877178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105974S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501923","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501924,"authors":[{"name":"Hanyu Zheng","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501924/zheng-2877199-small.gif","p":["Hanyu Zheng received the B.Sc. degree in information engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information and Electronics.

In this paper, the resource allocation problem for NOMA-enabled V2X communications is investigated. For V2I links, in view of the user fairness and the different requirements of cellular users (CUEs), weighted max-min rate fairness for CUEs is applied, where both identical weights and different weights are considered. As for V2V users (VUEs), the minimum signal-to-interference-plusnoise ratio (SINR) requirements are imposed on the problem formulation. To solve the proposed optimization problem, it is decoupled into three stages: 1) power allocation for CUEs; 2) power control and subcarrier (SC) assignment for VUE pairs; 3) SC assignment and user clustering for CUEs. For the three stages, algorithms based on the Perron-Frobenius theorem, the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, and the matching theory are proposed separately. Finally, an algorithm integrated the three stages is presented to obtain a joint solution.

Computer aided detection and diagnosis of cancer at the initial stages can increase the chances of recovery and thus reduce the mortality rate through timely prognosis and adequate treatment planning. The nuclear atypia scoring or histopathological breast tumor grading remains to be a challenging problem due to the various artifacts and variabilities introduced during slide preparation and also because of the complexity in the structure of the underlying tissue patterns. Inspired by the success of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices in many of the challenging tasks in machine learning and computer vision, a sparse coding and dictionary learning on SPD matrices is proposed in this paper for the breast tumor grading. The proposed covariance-based SPD matrices form a Riemannian manifold and are represented as the sparse combination of Riemannian dictionary atoms. Non-linearity of the SPD manifold is tackled by embedding into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space using kernels derived from log-Euclidean metric, Jeffrey and Stein divergences and compared with the non-kernel-based affine invariant Riemannian metric. The novelty of the work lies in exploiting the kernel approach for the Hilbert space embedding of the Riemannian manifold, that can achieve a better discrimination of the breast cancer tissues, following a sparse representation over learned dictionaries and henceforth it outperforms many of the state-of-the-art algorithms in breast cancer grading in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8501929/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18211976","pubMedId":"30346284","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Representation Over Learned Dictionaries on the Riemannian Manifold for Automated Grading of Nuclear Pleomorphism in Breast Cancer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Representation Over Learned Dictionaries on the Riemannian Manifold for Automated Grading of Nuclear Pleomorphism in Breast Cancer","sourcePdf":"tip-das-2877337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13728S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8511005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8511005","articleId":"8501929","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8501939,"authors":[{"name":"Konpal Shaukat Ali","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Divison, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8501939/ali-2877328-small.gif","p":["Konpal Shaukat Ali (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, in 2014, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

The approach is of practical value, as network services comprising a chain of virtual network functions (VNFs) are proposed to be queued on the basis of leading unexecuted VNFs at every server, rather than on the typical basis of services, reducing queues per server and facilitating queue management and signaling. It is also non-trivial because the VNFs of network services must be executed correctly in order at different VMs, coupling the optimal decisions of VMs on processing or offloading. Exploiting Lyapunov optimization techniques, we decouple the optimal decisions by deriving and minimizing the instantaneous upper bound of the NFV cost in a distributed fashion, and achieve the asymptotically minimum time-average cost. We also reduce the queue length by allowing individual VMs to (un)install VNFs based on local knowledge, achieving stable redeployment of VNFs, adapting to the network topology and the temporal and spatial variations of services. Simulations show that the proposed approach is able to reduce the time-average cost of NFV by 71% and reduce the queue length (or delay) by 74%, as compared with existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877336","startPage":"1225","endPage":"1237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08501940.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Function Placement and Online Optimization of Network Functions Virtualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Automated Function Placement and Online Optimization of Network Functions Virtualization","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18453653","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501940/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671154"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB0403402"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"17510710400"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Function Placement and Online Optimization of Network Functions Virtualization","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chen-2877336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108383S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8501940","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501941,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8501941/bjorn-2877331-small.gif","p":["Emil Bj\u00f6rnson (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912\u2013SM\u201917) received the M.S. degree in engineering mathematics from Lund University, Sweden, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, in 2011.

This distortion is correlated across the antennas but has been often approximated as uncorrelated to facilitate (tractable) SE analysis. To determine when this approximation is accurate, basic properties of distortion correlation are first uncovered. Then, we separately analyze the distortion correlation caused by third-order non-linearities and by quantization. Finally, we study the SE numerically and show that the distortion correlation can be safely neglected in massive MIMO when there are sufficiently many users.

The metasurface antennas consist of a printed cavity with dynamically tunable metamaterial radiators patterned on one side and fed by multiple radio frequency ports on the other side (each port representing one communication node), forming a shared aperture. By individual tuning of the radiators, the antennas can generate steerable, concurrent beams that can be adapted to the properties of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In this paper, we present a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system with simulated metasurface antennas as transmit and receive antennas operating at 5.9 GHz. We demonstrate that the flexibility in beamforming supported by the metasurface antennas can be used to achieve low spatial correlation and high SNR gain in clustered MIMO channels, leading to a significant improvement of the channel capacity. Numerical studies show 2.36-fold, 2.11-fold enhancements of capacity in MIMO channels with one and two clusters, respectively, compared with an MIMO system consisting of linear dipoles. The MIMO system based on the metasurface antennas can be low cost, low profile, and low power. The metasurface antenna thus has potential applications in small cell networks requiring high data rate under bandwidth, energy, and cost constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","volume":"67","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18467823","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501944/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Capacity of Spatial Multiplexing Systems Using Reconfigurable Cavity-Backed Metasurface Antennas in Clustered MIMO Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-12-1-0491 and FA9550-18-1-0187"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Capacity of Spatial Multiplexing Systems Using Reconfigurable Cavity-Backed Metasurface Antennas in Clustered MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yoo-2876899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141657S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8501944","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501945,"authors":[{"name":"Renaud-Alexandre Pitaval","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Kista, AB, Sweden"],"firstName":"Renaud-Alexandre","lastName":"Pitaval","orcid":"0000-0002-9300-8348","id":"38260775700"},{"name":"Branislav M.

In this paper, the error rate performance of NOMA systems is investigated over Nakagami-m fading channels, while considering imperfect successive interference cancellation. In particular, this paper focuses on the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, where exact PEP expressions are derived to characterize the performance of all users under different fading conditions. The obtained PEP expressions are then used to derive an exact union bound on the bit error rate (BER). Through the derived PEP expressions, the asymptotic PEP analysis is presented to investigate the maximum achievable diversity gain of NOMA users. Moreover, using the derived BER bound, the power allocation problem for all users in NOMA systems is considered under average power and users BER constraints, which allows realizing the full potential of NOMA. Monte Carlo simulation and numerical results are presented to corroborate the derived analytical expressions and give valuable insights into the error rate performance of each user and the achievable diversity gain.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2876867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08501953.pdf","startPage":"1586","endPage":"1599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2876867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Probability Analysis of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Over Nakagami-- Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Error Probability Analysis of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Over Nakagami-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501953/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18467813","htmlLink":"/document/8501953/","volume":"67","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012823","fundingName":"Telecommunications Regulatory Authority","grantNumber":"11/15/TRA-ICTFund/KU"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Probability Analysis of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Over Nakagami-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-aldweik-2876867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111246S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8501953","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501955,"authors":[{"name":"James Shey","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8621584/8501955/shey-2876835-small.gif","p":["James Shey received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2003, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, in 2008, and the M.E.M. degree from Old Dominion University in 2008.

Substantial changes in architecture have brought about not only improvements in speed and energy usage but also new security concerns. The presence of proprietary firmware onboard SSD controllers in particular raises the possibility that data believed by a user or operating system to be deleted physically remains on the drive and can thus be recovered. This security issue has a direct application to malware detection, digital forensics, and consumer privacy. To begin to address this, we propose a novel, noninvasive side-channel approach to infer the SSD trim operation. We demonstrate that it is possible to infer the trim operation with better than 99% accuracy using current probe measurements in conjunction with machine learning techniques. We find that the sampling frequency can be reduced to 200 kSps while maintaining greater than 80% of the total power in the 0-1 MHz band. The classifier accordingly uses only information in the frequency range between 0 and 100 kHz in achieving its high accuracy. We also validate our current probe measurement technique by comparing it with an in-line resistor.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2018.2876835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8621584/08501955.pdf","startPage":"1296","endPage":"1306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8621584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2018.2876835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring Device Current to Characterize Trim Operations of Solid-State Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring Device Current to Characterize Trim Operations of Solid-State Drives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501955/","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18410283","htmlLink":"/document/8501955/","volume":"14","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring Device Current to Characterize Trim Operations of Solid-State Drives","sourcePdf":"tifs-shey-2876835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122759S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8621584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8621584","articleId":"8501955","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501958,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Xiao","orcid":"0000-0003-2402-611X","id":"37579297100"},{"name":"Geyi Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Geyi","lastName":"Sheng","orcid":"0000-0003-3561-0215","id":"37086303473"},{"name":"Xiaoyue Wan","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyue","lastName":"Wan","orcid":"0000-0003-4808-7443","id":"37086017979"},{"name":"Wei Su","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Su","orcid":"0000-0003-1874-1256","id":"37402410200"},{"name":"Peng Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Cheng","orcid":"0000-0002-4221-2162","id":"37287113500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8501958","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":921},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Sensors","Channel estimation","Underwater acoustics","Frequency modulation","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","radio networks","telecommunication security","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark PHY-layer authentication","spoofing detection accuracy","deep learning","authentication accuracy","deep RL-based authentication scheme","light-weight spoofing detection","authentication parameter","underwater acoustic channel","power delay profile","underwater sensor networks","spoofing attacks","physical-layer authentication framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PHY-layer authentication","underwater sensor networks","reinforcement learning","spoofing detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501958","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8605392/08501958.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2877317","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2877317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-Based PHY-Layer Authentication for Underwater Sensor Networks","abstract":"In this letter, we propose a physical (PHY)-layer authentication framework to detect spoofing attacks in underwater sensor networks.

Experiment results show that this scheme improves the spoofing detection accuracy and increases the utility of the network compared with the benchmark PHY-layer authentication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501958/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"23","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18392420","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501958/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning-Based PHY-Layer Authentication for Underwater Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671396 and 61671398"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61761136012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011311","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology","grantNumber":"ICT180036"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Based PHY-Layer Authentication for Underwater Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-su-2877317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052869S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8605392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8605392","articleId":"8501958","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501960,"authors":[{"name":"Udit Satija","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Information Technology Dharwad, Hubli, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8568021/8501960/satij-2877055-small.gif","p":["Udit Satija received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Rajasthan Technical University, Kota, India, in 2010, the M.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, India, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in cardiovascular signal processing from the School of Electrical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar in 2018.

The proposed method consists of three major stages: 1) the ECG signal quality assessment (\u201cacceptable\u201d or \u201cunacceptable\u201d) based on our previous modified complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition and temporal features; 2) the ECG signal reconstruction and R-peak detection; and 3) the ECG beat classification including the ECG beat extraction, beat alignment, and normalized cross-correlation-based beat classification. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are evaluated using different normal and abnormal ECG signals taken from the standard MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Evaluation results show that the proposed quality-aware ECG beat classification method can significantly achieve false alarm reduction ranging from 24% to 93% under noisy ECG recordings. The R-peak detector achieves the average Se = 99.67% and positive predictivity (Pp) = 93.10% and the average sensitivity (Se) = 99.65% and Pp = 98.88% without and with denoising approaches, respectively. Results further showed that the proposed ECG beat extraction approach can improve the classification accuracy by preserving the QRS complex portion and suppressing the background noises under acceptable level of noises. The quality-aware ECG beat classification methods achieve higher kappa values for the classification accuracies which can be consistent as compared with the heartbeat classification methods without the ECG quality assessment process.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2018.2877055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2018.2877055","startPage":"277","endPage":"286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8568021/08501960.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8568021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Automated Signal Quality-Aware ECG Beat Classification Method for Unsupervised ECG Diagnosis Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"A New Automated Signal Quality-Aware ECG Beat Classification Method for Unsupervised ECG Diagnosis Environments","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18320953","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501960/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Automated Signal Quality-Aware ECG Beat Classification Method for Unsupervised ECG Diagnosis Environments","sourcePdf":"jsen-satija-2877055-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127447S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8568021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8568021","articleId":"8501960","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501961,"authors":[{"name":"Xianling Wang","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of Communication Network and Information Processing, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501961/wang-2877181-small.gif","p":["Xianling Wang (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

Different from prior works, we focus on opportunistically multiplexing different users on the same subchannel to avoid the severe inter-cell interference brought in by ultradense networking. Aiming to maximize the network throughput, we formulate a distributed subchannel assignment problem with local information exchange. This problem is analyzed through a locally cooperative game model, and the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) is confirmed by proving that the formulated game is an exact potential game. To solve the problem, we design two concurrent distributed algorithms based on best response (BR) and spatial adaptive play (SAP), respectively. The BR-based algorithm guarantees rapid convergence to an NE, which may not be globally optimal. On the contrary, the SAP-based algorithm can find the global optimum with an arbitrary large probability, although the learning process requires more iterations to converge. Simulation results reveal that the aggregate interference can be more efficiently suppressed in NOMA enhanced networks, which can lead to higher network throughputs. Besides, the superiority of NOMA over orthogonal multiple access is more obvious when the network grows denser.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Distributed Interference Mitigation for Small Cell Networks With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: A Locally Cooperative Game","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877181","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501961.pdf","startPage":"63107","endPage":"63119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Distributed Interference Mitigation for Small Cell Networks With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: A Locally Cooperative Game","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8501961/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18582958","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61822104, 61471025, 61771044, 61801412 and 61701422"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003392","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2016J01323 and 2017J01785"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST","grantNumber":"2016QNRC001"},{"fundingName":"Research Foundation of Ministry of Education of China & China Mobile","grantNumber":"MCM20170108"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"L172025 and L172049"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B170003"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"FRF-GF-17-A6 and RC1631"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimal Distributed Interference Mitigation for Small Cell Networks With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: A Locally Cooperative Game","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2877181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165333S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501961","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501963,"authors":[{"name":"Xiwang Dong","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8930649/8501963/dong-2873063-small.gif","p":["Xiwang Dong (M\u201913) received the B.E. degree in automation from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2014.","From 2014 to 2015, he was a Research Fellow with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and from 2014 to 2018, he was a Lecturer with the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

A TVFT control protocol is firstly constructed utilizing local neighboring information, where the information of the leader UAV is only available to partial followers and the neighborhood can be switching. An algorithm composed of four steps is provided to design the TVFT protocol. It is proved that the UAV swarm system can realize the TVFT using the designed protocol if the dwell time for the switching directed topologies is larger than a fixed threshold and the TVFT feasibility condition is satisfied. Based on the ultrawideband positioning technology, a quadrotor UAV formation control platform with four quadrotor UAVs is given. The obtained theoretical results are applied to solve the target enclosing problems of the UAV swarm systems. A flying experiment for three follower quadrotor UAVs to enclose a leader quadrotor UAV is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the presented results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8930649/08501963.pdf","startPage":"3674","endPage":"3685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2873063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2873063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Varying Formation Tracking for UAV Swarm Systems With Switching Directed Topologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Protocols","Target tracking","Time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","helicopters","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","position control","time-varying systems","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV swarm system","unmanned aerial vehicles","switching directed interaction topologies","TVFT control protocol","dwell time","TVFT feasibility condition","formation control platform","follower quadrotor UAVs","leader quadrotor UAV","neighboring information","time varying formation tracking control problems","ultrawideband positioning technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Formation tracking control","swarm system","switching directed topology","target enclosing","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Time-Varying Formation Tracking for UAV Swarm Systems With Switching Directed Topologies","volume":"30","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8501963/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19334817","pubMedId":"30346294","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873011, 61803014, 61503009 and 61333011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4182035"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST","grantNumber":"2017QNRC001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012130","fundingName":"Chinese Aeronautical Establishment","grantNumber":"2016ZA51005 and 20170151001"},{"fundingName":"Special Research Project of Chinese Civil Aircraft"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex Systems"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Zone Project","grantNumber":"17-163-11-ZT-004-017-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"YWF-18-BJ-Y-73"},{"fundingName":"Singapore MOE AcRF Tier1","grantNumber":"RG60/12(2012-T1-001-158)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Varying Formation Tracking for UAV Swarm Systems With Switching Directed Topologies","sourcePdf":"tnnls-dong-2873063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182733S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8930649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8930649","articleId":"8501963","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8501966,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Yin","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501966/yin-2877160-small.gif","p":["Rui Yin (S\u201903\u2013M\u201913) received the B.S.E. degree in computer engineering from Yanbian University in 2001, China, the M.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in information and electronic engineering from Zhejiang University in 2011.

Since the small base station (SBS) can use both licensed and unlicensed bands, the EE on licensed and unlicensed spectrum need to be considered jointly to improve the EE of the whole system. First, the trade-off between the EE on licensed and unlicensed bands is analyzed when the SBS reuses the licensed bands with a macro base station (MBS) and shares unlicensed bands with multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP)s. Furthermore, the weighted Tchebycheff method is applied to demonstrate the Pareto optimal EE tradeoff on licensed and unlicensed bands numerically. Based on the analysis, how the EE on the licensed bands interacts with the EE on the unlicensed bands is revealed. Accordingly, ajoint power, licensed and unlicensed spectrum allocation scheme is proposed to improve the system EE. Numerical results are presented to validate the analysis and verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501966.pdf","startPage":"64050","endPage":"64062","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency in LTE-U Based Small Cell Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency in LTE-U Based Small Cell Systems","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8501966/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495563","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771429, 61301143 and 61871021"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY14F010002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy Efficiency in LTE-U Based Small Cell Systems","sourcePdf":"access-yin-2877160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094638S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501966","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8501970,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501970/li-2877252-small.gif","p":["Fei Li received the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from Inner Mongolia University, China, in 2014.

The most fascinating features of FBMC are high spectral efficiency and extremely low out-of-band emissions by removing the CP and using well-localized pulse shapes. FBMC exhibits intrinsic inter-carrier/intersymbol interference which can be mitigated by techniques such as offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM). However, OQAM does not work well in multi-path fading channels. Consequently, conventional channel estimation methods and MIMO based upon space-time/frequency block coding are not straightforward applicable to the FBMC system. This paper presents two new transceiver architectures for the FBMC/QAM matrix. First of all, the matrix models of the FBMC/QAM scheme are derived. Second, based on the matrix models, three receiver methods are then described. Then, the scheme of combining FBMC/QAM with channel estimation and MIMO is proposed. Finally, two simplified receiver algorithms based on the matrix models are proposed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed transceivers of the FBMC/QAM matrix scheme can directly combine with the channel estimation and MIMO techniques used in conventional OFDM systems. Furthermore, the proposed transceivers of the FBMC/QAM matrix scheme have almost the same BER performance compared with the conventional OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501970.pdf","startPage":"63987","endPage":"63998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QAM Signal Transmission Based on Matrix Model in Filter-Bank Multicarrier Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501970/","displayDocTitle":"QAM Signal Transmission Based on Matrix Model in Filter-Bank Multicarrier Systems","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495565","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8501970/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61628102 and 61271183"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"QAM Signal Transmission Based on Matrix Model in Filter-Bank Multicarrier Systems","sourcePdf":"access-zheng-2877252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103558S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501970","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501973,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Zhan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8511005/8501973/zhan-2877335-small.gif","p":["Kun Zhan received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.

We learn a consensus graph with minimizing disagreement between different views and constraining the rank of the Laplacian matrix. Since diverse views admit the same underlying cluster structure across multiple views, we use a new disagreement cost function for regularizing graphs from different views toward a common consensus. Simultaneously, we impose a rank constraint on the Laplacian matrix to learn the consensus graph with exactly k connected components where k is the number of clusters, which is different from using fixed affinity matrices in most existing graph-based methods. With the learned consensus graph, we can directly obtain the cluster labels without performing any post-processing, such as kmeans clustering algorithm in spectral clustering-based methods. A multiview consensus clustering method is proposed to learn such a graph. An efficient iterative updating algorithm is derived to optimize the proposed challenging optimization problem. Experiments on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of seven metrics.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Kernel","Linear programming","Learning systems","Periodic structures","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","iterative methods","matrix algebra","optimisation","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization problem","efficient iterative updating algorithm","k-means clustering algorithm","exactly k connected components","rank constraint","regularizing graphs","disagreement cost function","data points","multiview consensus graph clustering method","cluster structure","graph structure","spectral clustering-based methods","cluster labels","learned consensus graph","fixed affinity matrices","Laplacian matrix","clustering performance","graph-based multiview"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unsupervised learning","multiview clustering","image retrieval","graph learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501973","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2877335","startPage":"1261","endPage":"1270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8511005/08501973.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2877335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501973/","displayDocTitle":"Multiview Consensus Graph Clustering","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","volume":"28","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18211975","pubMedId":"30346283","htmlLink":"/document/8501973/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201422"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20120211120013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiview Consensus Graph Clustering","sourcePdf":"tip-wang-2877335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140305S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8511005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8511005","articleId":"8501973","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501974,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8501974/wang-2877210-small.gif","p":["Qian Wang received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2015, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications.

In this paper, we study secure transmission in a four-node (source, destination, mobile relay, and eavesdropper) system, wherein we focus on maximizing the secrecy rate via jointly optimizing the relay trajectory and the source/relay transmit power. Nevertheless, due to the coupling of the trajectory designing and the power allocating, the secrecy rate maximization problem is intractable to solve. Accordingly, we propose an alternating optimization approach, wherein the trajectory designing and the power allocating are tackled in an alternating manner. Unfortunately, the trajectory designing is a nonconvex problem, and thus, it is still hard to solve. To circumvent the nonconvexity, we exploit sequential convex programming to derive an iterative algorithm, which is proven to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the trajectory design problem. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the joint power and trajectory design in improving the secrecy throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08501974.pdf","startPage":"62849","endPage":"62855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power and Trajectory Design for Physical-Layer Secrecy in the UAV-Aided Mobile Relaying System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power and Trajectory Design for Physical-Layer Secrecy in the UAV-Aided Mobile Relaying System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501974/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18582959","htmlLink":"/document/8501974/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571089 and 61631004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Power and Trajectory Design for Physical-Layer Secrecy in the UAV-Aided Mobile Relaying System","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2877210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081601S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8501974","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501976,"authors":[{"name":"Yating Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yating","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-2303-3740","id":"37086546161"},{"name":"Tian Song","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Song","orcid":"0000-0003-3275-6593","id":"37086545781"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8501976","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501976","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network security","Payloads","Bandwidth","Analytical models","Scalability","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequent packet fragmentation","nontrivial traffic overhead","unlimited-length names","local name translation","succinct local communication","scalable naming","succinctness","hierarchical naming","globally massive data","named data networking of things","succinct communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Named data networking","Internet of Things","succinct communication","name convention"]}],"abstract":"Scalable and hierarchical naming on contents enables the flexibility of named data networking of things towards globally massive data and applications.

We demonstrate the vulnerability of the CSI estimation process to pilot-contamination (PC) attacks. In our attack model, the attacker aims at minimizing the sum rate of downlink transmissions by contaminating the uplink pilots. We first study these attacks for two downlink power allocation strategies under the assumption that the attacker knows the locations of the BS and its users. Later on, we relax this assumption and consider the case when such knowledge is probabilistic. The formulated problems are solved using stochastic optimization, Lagrangian minimization, and game-theoretic methods. A closed-form solution for a special case of the problem is obtained. Furthermore, we analyze the achievable individual secrecy rates under PC attacks and provide an upper bound on these rates. We also study this scenario without a priori knowledge of user locations at the attacker by introducing chance constraints.

In particular, we consider a cellular system, where popular files are cached in a distributed fashion in a limited number of the mobile devices using an MDS code and can be downloaded from them using device-to-device (D2D) communication. The base station controls the D2D communication and assists the requests that cannot be fully satisfied by the distributed caching (DC) network by providing the missing data. We consider a network model, where the cell is divided into clusters, where D2D links can be activated. We derive an analytical expression for the delay incurred in downloading content from the wireless network assuming that devices roam in and out of clusters according to a Poisson random process. Our analysis allows to identify the parameters of the wireless network that mostly affect the performance and to compare different caching strategies in terms of delay. We show that DC using MDS codes can dramatically reduce the download delay with respect to the scenario where content is always downloaded from the base station and to the case of uncoded DC.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2876921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2876921","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08501981.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MDS-Coded Distributed Caching for Low Delay Wireless Content Delivery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"MDS-Coded Distributed Caching for Low Delay Wireless Content Delivery","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18467794","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501981/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Marie Curie fellowship","grantNumber":"contract 658785-DISC-H2020-MSCA-IF-2014"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council","grantNumber":"#2016-04253"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MDS-Coded Distributed Caching for Low Delay Wireless Content Delivery","sourcePdf":"tcomm-piemontese-2876921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082729S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8501981","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501982,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuaki Nakamura","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8621584/8501982/nakam-2876752-small.gif","p":["Kazuaki Nakamura (M\u201913) received the B.S. degree in engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in informatics from Kyoto University in 2005, 2007, and 2011, respectively.

In addition, the performance of image recognition has drastically increased with deep learning technologies. From these backgrounds, some photo-based information services provided in a client-server architecture are getting popular: client users take a photo of a certain spot and send it to a server, while the server identifies the spot with an image recognizer and returns its related information to the users. However, this kind of client-server image recognition can cause a privacy issue because image recognition results are sometimes privacy-sensitive. To tackle the privacy issue, in this paper, we propose a framework of privacy-preserving image recognition called EnfPire, in which the server cannot uniquely determine the recognition result but client users can do so. An overview of EnfPire is as follows. First, client users extract a visual feature from their taken photo and transform it so that the server cannot uniquely determine the recognition result. Then, the users send the transformed feature to the server that returns a set of candidates of the recognition result to the users. Finally, the users compare the candidates to the original visual feature for obtaining the final result. Our experimental results demonstrate that EnfPire successfully degrades the server's spot-recognition accuracy from 99.8% to 41.4% while keeping 86.9% of the spot-recognition accuracy on the user side.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8621584/08501982.pdf","startPage":"1264","endPage":"1279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2018.2876752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2018.2876752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8621584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encryption-Free Framework of Privacy-Preserving Image Recognition for Photo-Based Information Services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Image recognition","Visualization","Privacy","Information services","Cryptography","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","feature extraction","image recognition","image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spot-recognition accuracy","EnfPire","privacy-sensitive","privacy issue","client-server image recognition","image recognizer","client users","client-server architecture","photo-based information services","privacy-preserving image recognition","encryption-free framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Privacy protection","image recognition","client-server architectures","feature transformation","photo-based information services"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Encryption-Free Framework of Privacy-Preserving Image Recognition for Photo-Based Information Services","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8501982/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18410277","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"JP16H06302 and JP17K00235"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Encryption-Free Framework of Privacy-Preserving Image Recognition for Photo-Based Information Services","sourcePdf":"tifs-nakamura-2876752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137681S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8621584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8621584","articleId":"8501982","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8501983,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8501983/zheng-2877329-small.gif","p":["Zhong Zheng (S\u201910\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree from the Beijing University of Technology, China, in 2007, the M.Sc. degree from the Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, in 2010, and the D.Sc. degree from Aalto University, Finland, in 2015.

The cooperative MIMO system in this paper (referred to as reconfigurable distributed MIMO) is formed by temporarily activating clusters of nearby trusted mobile devices, with each cluster being centrally coordinated by its corresponding cluster head. We assume that the transmitters apply a practical eigendirection precoding scheme to transmit the confidential signal and artificial noise, while the eavesdropper can be located in multiple possible locations in the proximity. We first obtain the expression of the secrecy rate, where the required average mutual information between the transmitters and the eavesdropper is characterized by closed-form approximations. The proposed approximations are especially useful in the secrecy rate maximization, where the original non-convex problem can be solved by the successive convex approximations. Numerical results show that the secrecy rate can be significantly improved by leveraging the location constraint of the eavesdropper, compared to the existing result. We also demonstrate that the secrecy rate can be further improved by increasing the cluster size.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08501983.pdf","startPage":"1356","endPage":"1370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Rate of Cooperative MIMO in the Presence of a Location Constrained Eavesdropper","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8501983","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8642462/8501983-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Rate of Cooperative MIMO in the Presence of a Location Constrained Eavesdropper","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501983/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18467806","htmlLink":"/document/8501983/","volume":"67","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"W911NF1810406"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECSS-1533282"},{"fundingName":"German research council (DFG) via the CRC 1283: \u201cTaming uncertainty and profiting from randomness and low regularity in analysis, stochastics and their applications\u201d"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Secrecy Rate of Cooperative MIMO in the Presence of a Location Constrained Eavesdropper","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zheng-2877329-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134171S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8501983","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501987,"authors":[{"name":"Shakil Ahamed Khan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/8651608/8501987/khan-2877397-small.gif","p":["Shakil Ahamed Khan (S\u201918) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET), Rajshahi, Bangladesh, in 2009, and the master's degree from the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2015.

A cascaded control scheme consisting of a finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) with an extended state observer (ESO) is proposed to govern the converter. In this scheme, a proportional integral (PI) controller combined with an ESO-based disturbance observer is employed as an external control loop. This control loop dynamically modifies the active power reference to realize the desired operating point of the system state (converter output voltage). The proposed control system presents a high degree of disturbance rejection capability and robustness against the external disturbances to the converter, whereas the conventional PI control performance suffers in the presence of these disturbances. In this paper, the inner current tracking loop is accomplished by an FCS-MPC algorithm. This algorithm is derived to force the input currents to track the reference values while realizing a user-defined reactive power and maintaining balanced voltages in the series-connected capacitors. Theoretical analysis and the design procedure of the proposed control system are presented. Finally, experimental studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501987/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2019","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2019","accessionNumber":"18509129","publicationDate":"March-April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501987/","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Observer Based Control for Single-Phase Asymmetrical T-Type AC/DC Power Converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Observer Based Control for Single-Phase Asymmetrical T-Type AC/DC Power Converter","sourcePdf":"tia-khan-2877397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135456S","chronDate":"March-April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"8651608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8651608","articleId":"8501987","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":8501989,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8501989/xu-2877466-small.gif","p":["Jing Xu received the B.E. degree in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and information engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2001 and 2011, respectively.

Multiple relays capable of energy harvesting are deployed in the network to assist the information transmission. The hybrid access point can wirelessly supply energy to the relays, achieving multi-user gains from signal and energy cooperation. We propose a joint optimization for signal beamforming of the hybrid access point as well as wireless energy harvesting and collaborative beamforming strategies of the relays. The objective is to maximize the network throughput subject to probabilistic interference constraints at the cellular user equipment. We formulate the throughput maximization with both the time-switching and power-splitting schemes, which impose very different couplings between the operating parameters for wireless power and information transfer. Although the optimization problems are inherently non-convex, they share similar structural properties that can be leveraged for an efficient algorithm design. In particular, by exploiting monotonicity in the throughput, we maximize it iteratively via customized polyblock approximation with reduced complexity. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve close to optimal performance in terms of the energy efficiency and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08501989.pdf","startPage":"973","endPage":"987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Transmissions in Wireless-Powered Multi-Relay Networks With Chance Interference Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Robust Transmissions in Wireless-Powered Multi-Relay Networks With Chance Interference Constraints","volume":"67","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8501989/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18467801","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501989/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601449, 61503368 and 61602462"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Basic Research Program","grantNumber":"JCYJ20151117161854942"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Talent Peacock Plan Program","grantNumber":"KQTD2015071715073798"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61771162"},{"fundingName":"Singapore MOE Tier 1","grantNumber":"2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17"},{"fundingName":"MOE Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15 and NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Transmissions in Wireless-Powered Multi-Relay Networks With Chance Interference Constraints","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gong-2877466-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147046S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8501989","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501993,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, The University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8501993/xu-2877471-small.gif","p":["Chao Xu (S\u201909\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunications from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2008, the B.Sc.(Eng.) degree (Hons.) in telecommunications from the Queen Mary University of London, U.K., in 2008, through the Sino-U.K. Joint Degree Program, and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in radio frequency communication systems and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from The University of Southampton, U.K., in 2009 and 2015, respectively.

The bespoke design is the first MSDSD solution in the open literature that is applicable to the generic differential space-time modulation (DSTM) for transmission over Ricean fading. In the light of this development, the recently developed differential spatial modulation and its diversity counterpart of differential space-time block coding using index shift keying are specifically recommended for aeronautical applications owing to their low-complexity single-RF and finite-cardinality features. Moreover, we further devise a noncoherent decision-feedback differential detection and a channel-state information estimation aided coherent detection, which also take into account the same Ricean features. Finally, the advantages of the proposed techniques in different scenarios lead us to propose for the aeronautical systems to adaptively: 1) switch between coherent and non-coherent schemes; 2) switch between single- and multiple-antenna-based schemes as well as; and 3) switch between high-diversity and high-throughput DSTM schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877471","startPage":"1099","endPage":"1116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08501993.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Coherent/Non-Coherent Single/Multiple-Antenna Aided Channel Coded Ground-to-Air Aeronautical Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Coherent/Non-Coherent Single/Multiple-Antenna Aided Channel Coded Ground-to-Air Aeronautical Communication","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18467802","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8501993/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/PO34284/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Coherent/Non-Coherent Single/Multiple-Antenna Aided Channel Coded Ground-to-Air Aeronautical Communication","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-2877471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.321246S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8501993","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8501995,"authors":[{"name":"Peyman Faizian","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of North Florida, Jacksonville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/8630102/8501995/faizi-2877264-small.gif","p":["Peyman Faizian received the BS degree in computer science and the MS degree in algorithms and computation from the University of Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer science from Florida State University, in 2018.

UGAL directs traffic based on link loads but may make inappropriate adaptive routing decisions in various situations, which degrades its performance. In this work, we propose traffic pattern-based adaptive routing (TPR) for Dragonfly that improves UGAL by incorporating a traffic pattern-based adaptation mechanism. The idea is to explicitly use the link usage statistics that are collected in performance counters to infer the traffic pattern, and to take the inferred traffic pattern plus link loads into consideration when making adaptive routing decisions. Our performance evaluation results on a diverse set of traffic conditions indicate that by incorporating the traffic pattern-based adaptation mechanism, TPR is much more effective in making adaptive routing decisions and achieves significant lower latency under low load and higher throughput under high load than its underlying UGAL.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8630102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/8630102/08501995.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2018.2877264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2018.2877264","startPage":"931","endPage":"943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TPR: Traffic Pattern-Based Adaptive Routing for Dragonfly Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8501995/","displayDocTitle":"TPR: Traffic Pattern-Based Adaptive Routing for Dragonfly Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8501995/","volume":"4","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2019","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"0000219853 and DE-SC0016039"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TPR: Traffic Pattern-Based Adaptive Routing for Dragonfly Networks","sourcePdf":"tmscs-faizian-2877264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07241S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"8630102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8630102","articleId":"8501995","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8502020,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502020/hu-2877432-small.gif","p":["Rui Hu received the B.E. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and the M.S. degree from Ohio State University in 2014.

Channel estimators that require knowledge of the array response, such as those using compressive sensing (CS) methods, may suffer from performance degradation when array-inherent impairments bring unknown phase errors and gain errors to the antenna elements. In this paper, we design matrix completion (MC)-based channel estimation schemes which are robust against the array-inherent impairments. We first design an open-loop training scheme that can sample entries from the effective channel matrix randomly and is compatible with the phase shifter-based hybrid system. Leveraging the low-rank property of the effective channel matrix, we then design a channel estimator based on the generalized conditional gradient framework and the alternating minimization approach. The resulting estimator is immune to array-inherent impairments and can be implemented to systems with any array shapes for its independence of the array response. In addition, we extend our design to sample a transformed channel matrix following the concept of inductive matrix completion (IMC), which can be solved efficiently using our proposed channel estimator and can achieve similar performance with a lower requirement of the dynamic range of the transmission power per antenna. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed MC-based channel estimator in terms of estimation performance, computational complexity, and robustness against array-inherent impairments over the orthogonal matching pursuit-based CS channel estimator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18582961","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8502020/","displayDocTitle":"Matrix Completion-Based Channel Estimation for MmWave Communication Systems With Array-Inherent Impairments","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Matrix Completion-Based Channel Estimation for MmWave Communication Systems With Array-Inherent Impairments","sourcePdf":"access-hu-2877432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153686S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502020","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502025,"authors":[{"name":"Guizhong Guo","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xinxiang University, Xinxiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502025/guo-2877023-small.gif","p":["Guizhong Guo was born in Nanyang, Henan, China in 1978.

With the development of deep learning algorithms, studies that are based on the human gait using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) have achieved promising performance for human identification. However, CNN and LSTM-based methods have the limitation of having higher loss of temporal and spatial information, respectively. In our approach, we use shallow CNN stacked with LSTM and deep CNN followed by score fusion to capture more spatial and temporal features. In addition, there have been a few studies regarding gait-based human identification based on the front and back view images of humans captured in low-illumination environments. This makes it difficult to extract conventional features, such as skeleton joints, cycle, cadence, and the lengths of walking strides. To overcome these problems, we designed our method considering the front and back view images captured in both highand lowillumination environments. The experimental results obtained using a self-collected database and the open database of the institute of automation Chinese academy of sciences gait dataset C show that the proposed method outperforms previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502031.pdf","startPage":"63164","endPage":"63186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Gait-Based Human Identification by Combining Shallow Convolutional Neural Network-Stacked Long Short-Term Memory and Deep Convolutional Neural Network","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18582966","htmlLink":"/document/8502031/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2018R1D1A1B07041921"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1D1A1B03028417"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1C1B5074062"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Gait-Based Human Identification by Combining Shallow Convolutional Neural Network-Stacked Long Short-Term Memory and Deep Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-park-2876890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133828S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502031","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502032,"authors":[{"name":"Zhilin Feng","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Power Transmission and Distribution Equipment Technology, College of IoT Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502032/feng-2877398-small.gif","p":["Zhilin Feng received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Hohai University, China, in 2017, where she is currently pursuing the M.S. degree in electrical engineering.

The neural network adaptive law is obtained by using the Lyapunov method, and the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are guaranteed by adjusting the adaptive weight. The super-twisting sliding mode control method is adopted in order to improve the convergence speed and weaken the chattering. Finally, the simulation results verify the superiority and validity of the proposed method and compare it with the super-twisting sliding mode control without RBF neural network. Simulation results indicate that the control method proposed in this paper is very effective and feasible, achieving the required dynamic and static performance.

However, the latest video compression standards have more complex artifacts than the JPEG, including the flickering which is not well reduced by the CNN-based methods developed for still images. Moreover, recent video compression algorithms include in-loop filters which reduce the blocking artifacts, and thus post-processing barely improves the performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal-CNN architecture to reduce the artifacts in video compression standards as well as in JPEG. Specifically, we exploit a simple CNN structure and introduce a new training strategy that captures the temporal correlation of the consecutive frames in videos. The similar patches are aggregated from the neighboring frames by a simple motion search method, and they are fed to the CNN, which further reduces the artifacts. Experiments show that our approach shows improvements over the conventional CNN-based methods with similar complexities for image and video compression standards, such as MPEG-2, AVC, and HEVC, with average PSNR gain of 1.27, 0.47, and 0.23 dB, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Video Compression Artifacts Based on Deep Temporal Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502045.pdf","startPage":"63094","endPage":"63106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Video Compression Artifacts Based on Deep Temporal Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8502045/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18582971","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003600","fundingName":"Korean National Police Agency","grantNumber":"PA-C000001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reduction of Video Compression Artifacts Based on Deep Temporal Networks","sourcePdf":"access-cho-2876864-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096142S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502045","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502058,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8550816/8502058/xiao-2869964-small.gif","p":["Yong Xiao (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2012.

This paper introduces a novel inter-operator network slicing framework in which multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) can coordinate and jointly slice their accessible spectrum resources in both licensed and unlicensed bands. For licensed band slicing, we propose an inter-operator spectrum aggregation method that allows two or more MNOs to cooperate and share their licensed bands to support a common set of service types. We then consider the sharing of unlicensed bands. Because all MNOs enjoy equal rights to access these bands, we introduce the concept of right sharing for MNOs to share and trade their spectrum access rights. We develop a modified back-of-the-envelope method for MNOs to evaluate their Value-of-Rights when coexisting with other wireless technologies. A network slicing game based on the overlapping coalition formation game is formulated to investigate the possible cooperation among MNOs. We prove that our proposed game always has at least one stable slicing structure that maximizes the social welfare. To implement our proposed framework without requiring MNOs to reveal private information to other MNOs, we develop a distributed algorithm called distributed alternating direction method of multipliers with partially variable splitting. Performance evaluation of our proposed framework is provided using a discrete-event simulator that is driven by real MNO deployment scenarios based on over 400 base station locations deployed by two primary cellular operators in the city of Dublin. Numerical results show that our proposed frameworks can almost double the capacity for all supported services for each MNO in an urban setting.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8550816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2018.2869964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8550816/08502058.pdf","startPage":"2260","endPage":"2274","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2018.2869964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Network Slicing Over Licensed and Unlicensed Bands","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/8550816/8502058-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Network Slicing Over Licensed and Unlicensed Bands","volume":"36","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8502058/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18285760","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"# IIP-1265960, CNS-1731164, CNS-1409172 and CNS-1563655"},{"fundingName":"Broadband Wireless Access & Applications Center (BWAC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Distributed Resource Allocation for Network Slicing Over Licensed and Unlicensed Bands","sourcePdf":"jsac-xiao-2869964-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106098S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8550816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8550816","articleId":"8502058","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8502059,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Schuiki","affiliation":["D-ITET, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/8664420/8502059/schui-2876312-small.gif","p":["Fabian Schuiki received the BSc and MSc degree in electrical engineering from ETH Z\u00fcrich, in 2014 and 2016, respectively.

We consider two residual self-interference (RSI) models with or without direct links. We propose a sub-optimal relay selection (SRS) scheme which requires only the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links. To evaluate the performance, the outage probability of SRS is derived for different scenarios depending on RSI models and the availability of direct links. To further investigate, asymptotic expressions are derived for the high-transmit power regime. For comparison purposes, 1) the average throughputs of the FD and half-duplex (HD) modes are derived; 2) non-orthogonal transmission is considered and its performance is discussed with approximations; and 3) the impact of imperfect CSI is investigated with the aid of analysis. While simulation results are provided to verify the analytical results, they reveal interesting fundamental trends. It turns out that a significant throughput degradation occurs with FD mode over HD mode when self-interference is fully proportional to the transmit power. Since all users can communicate in the same coherence time with the FD mode, these joint RS schemes are useful for user-fairness low-latency applications.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877393","startPage":"955","endPage":"972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08502064.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-User Relay Selection for Full-Duplex Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User Relay Selection for Full-Duplex Radio","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18467805","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502064/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DE160100020"},{"fundingName":"Discovery Project (DP)","grantNumber":"DP180101205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User Relay Selection for Full-Duplex Radio","sourcePdf":"tcomm-bandaraatapattu-2877393-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.247193S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8502064","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502066,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez-Amarillo","affiliation":["Telematics Department, University of Cauca, Popay\u00e1n, Colombia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502066/gonza-2877293-small.gif","p":["Carlos Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez-Amarillo received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the Universidad Pedag\u00f3gica y Tecnol\u00f3gica de Colombia, Tunja, Colombia, in 2017.

Traced products are generally of high quality and high commercial value, making the voluntary adoption of traceability processes for the market in processed products and trade in fresh products more common today. The transmission of diseases to humans, along with the cases of chemical poisoning, provided the motive for changes in trade relations between the countries and in the manner of assessing consumer safety. The model allows the tracking of variables, such as luminosity, humidity, temperature, and water consumption, thereby revealing overall water use, growth patterns of the plants, and the timeline for harvest of produce. The system enables automated control of the indoor environment of the greenhouse using an irrigation system or temperature control and presents the main outline of internal traceability of agricultural products from seed to final produce. By means of an IoT platform, this greenhouse design finally facilitates a novel analysis of the behavior of a number of species that comprise the local agriculture in one region of Colombia.","topic":"New Trends in Brain Signal Processing and Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","publicationDate":"2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8502066/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2018","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An IoT-Based Traceability System for Greenhouse Seedling Crops","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005682","fundingName":"Universidad del Cauca","grantNumber":"779-2017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An IoT-Based Traceability System for Greenhouse Seedling Crops","sourcePdf":"access-ramirezgonzalez-2877293-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05531S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["New Trends in Brain Signal Processing and Analysis"],"articleId":"8502066","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8502067,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/8854959/8502067/gao-2877459-small.gif","p":["Hui Gao received the PhD degree from the State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2017.

However, new challenges arise: one is how to evaluate the quality of data each mobile user potentially is capable of providing; another is how to allocate a satisfactory yet profitable amount of reward to mobile users in order to keep them participating in crowd sensing tasks. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical model for characterizing quality of sensing data to be contributed by mobile users. Then, we present a utility function and formulate an optimization problem for the platform, who recruits participants to contribute sensing data, to maximize the amount of high quality sensing data under a limited task budget. We next present an effective and quality-aware incentive mechanism to solve this problem for online scenarios where participants may arrive or leave at any random time. Moreover, the proposed incentive mechanism allows the platform to provide selected participants with an extra bonus according to task completion level and their previous performance to motivate them further. We formally show the proposed mechanism has the desirable properties of truthfulness, individual rationality, budgetary feasibility, and computational efficiency. We compare the proposed scheme with existing methods via simulation using a real dataset. Extensive simulation results well justify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach, e.g, compared with another online method \u201cOMG\u201d, the gap to the optimum for our proposed Online-QIM approach is reduce by 33.3 percent when budget B = 1000.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/8854959/08502067.pdf","startPage":"2589","endPage":"2603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2018.2877459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2018.2877459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8854959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Quality-Aware Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing with Extra Bonus","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Task analysis","Data integrity","Mobile computing","Computer science","Mobile handsets","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human factors","incentive schemes","mobile computing","optimisation","utility theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile crowd sensing","extra bonus","smart mobile devices","online quality-aware incentive mechanism","urban environments","utility function","optimization","Online-QIM approach","motivation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile crowd sensing","incentive mechanism design","data quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Online Quality-Aware Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing with Extra Bonus","volume":"18","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8502067/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2019","accessionNumber":"19044180","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61602051"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017RC11"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002766","fundingName":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","grantNumber":"SKLNST-2016-2-04"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772072"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1525920"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Quality-Aware Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing with Extra Bonus","sourcePdf":"tmc-liu-2877459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.220223S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8854959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8854959","articleId":"8502067","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8502070,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hammouda","affiliation":["McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488902/8920153/8502070/hammo-2877441-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Hammouda received the MASc degree from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, in 2017."]},"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hammouda","id":"38138739600"},{"name":"Rong Zheng","affiliation":["McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488902/8920153/8502070/zheng-2877441-small.gif","p":["Rong Zheng (S'03-M'04-SM'10) received the BE and ME degress in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, P.R.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal opportunistic multi-channel spectrum sensing and access using full-duplex (FD) radios in the presence of uncertain primary user (PU) activity statistics. A joint learning and spectrum access scheme is proposed. To optimize its throughput, the SU sensing period has to be carefully tuned. However, in absence of exact knowledge of the PU activity statistics, the PU's performance may be adversely affected. To address this problem, we formulate a robust optimization problem. Our analysis shows that under some non-restrictive simplifying assumptions, the robust optimization problem is convex. We analyze the impact of the sensing period on the PU collision probability and the SU throughput, and find the optimal sensing period via convex optimization. We show that sublinear regrets can be attained by the proposed estimation and robust optimization strategy. Simulation studies also demonstrate that the resulting robust solution provides a good trade-off between optimizing the SU's throughput and protecting the PU.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSE.2018.2877441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8920153","startPage":"885","endPage":"897","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488902/8920153/08502070.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-Theoretic Multi-Channel Spectrum Sensing and Access in Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio Networks with Unknown Primary User Activities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502070/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning-Theoretic Multi-Channel Spectrum Sensing and Access in Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio Networks with Unknown Primary User Activities","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19194213","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"Discovery"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Theoretic Multi-Channel Spectrum Sensing and Access in Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio Networks with Unknown Primary User Activities","sourcePdf":"tnse-zheng-2877441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083989S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488902","isNumber":"8920153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488902","xplore-issue":"8920153","articleId":"8502070","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502072,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Fei Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8613096/8502072/hu-2877301-small.gif","p":["Peng Fei Hu (S\u201917) was born in Xiangyang, China.

The patch antenna is fed by an F-shaped probe, which consists of one upper and two lower horizontal arms, as well as a vertical arm that connects them. Owing to the novel excitation scheme, two probe modes along with a patch mode are simultaneously excited within the passband, producing a wide bandwidth of 21.3% with stable antenna gains and radiation patterns. Meanwhile, cross-coupling is constructed in the antenna, generating two symmetrical radiation nulls right at the two sides of the passband. Consequently, a compact filtering antenna with bandpass response and high selectivity is obtained, without utilizing any extra filtering circuit. This design is also extended to realize a reconfigurable filtering antenna. Two varactor diodes are embedded in the F-shaped probe to continuously tune the frequency of the operating band from 2.05 to 2.52 GHz. The antenna bandwidth can be flexibly tuned from 2.2% to 21.3%, and simultaneously good filtering performance is kept during the tuning of different states.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2877301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8613096/08502072.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8613096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2877301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"121","endPage":"130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Filtering Patch Antenna With Reconfigurable Frequency and Bandwidth Using F-Shaped Probe","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Filtering Patch Antenna With Reconfigurable Frequency and Bandwidth Using F-Shaped Probe","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502072/","volume":"67","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8502072/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18409982","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871187"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"2016A030306007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Filtering Patch Antenna With Reconfigurable Frequency and Bandwidth Using F-Shaped Probe","sourcePdf":"tap-pan-2877301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10758S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8613096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8613096","articleId":"8502072","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502082,"authors":[{"name":"Ruijuan Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502082/zheng-2877423-small.gif","p":["Ruijuan Zheng received the Dr.Eng. degree in computer application from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2008.

These applications can be delivered among different devices with different operating systems, computing tasks, and data storage capabilities, adopting D2D communication mode. However, because the application delivery process covers three entities, namely user-environmental-service, trusted problems are ubiquitous. Therefore, before cloud provides substantive services, how to identify the trusted degree of user identity and its behaviors for D2D communications is the core problem. First, from the perspective of user trustability, this paper proposed an analysis method to user abnormal behaviors for D2D communications in mobile cloud environment. In this method, user behavior is normalized to a \u201cuser sequence operation\u201didentity fragment with the same length, offset, and amplitude. The hierarchical matching method and the blacklist mechanism are used to determine whether the user behavior for D2D communications is beyond the scope of trusted tolerance. Second, considering that the user sequence behavior step is a complex graph structure with continuous dynamic growth, this paper proposed a pattern growth method based on maximum and right-most path extension for autonomous optimization. At last, the experimental results showed that the classification accuracy under the KDD CUP99 data set and real network environment was 94.8% and 90.2%, respectively, which was 5.3% and 6.9% higher than the traditional methods. In addition, it can be seen from the experimental results that this scheme could significantly improve the recognition speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502082.pdf","startPage":"63005","endPage":"63020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anomaly Recognition and Autonomic Optimization Method to User\u2019s Sequence Behaviors for D2D Communications in MCC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Cloud computing","Anomaly detection","Blacklisting","Optimization","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","graph theory","mobile computing","security of data","storage management","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile cloud environment","user behavior","user sequence operationidentity fragment","hierarchical matching method","trusted tolerance","user sequence behavior step","pattern growth method","autonomous optimization","anomaly recognition","autonomic optimization method","mobile cloud computing uses cloud","mobile devices","data storage capabilities","D2D communication mode","application delivery process","user-environmental-service","trusted problems","substantive services","trusted degree","user identity","user trustability","analysis method","user abnormal behaviors","operating systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MCC","D2D communications","user\u2019s sequence behaviors","on-line identification"]}],"topic":"Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Anomaly Recognition and Autonomic Optimization Method to User\u2019s Sequence Behaviors for D2D Communications in MCC","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8502082/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18582972","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61602155, U1604155, 61871430 and 61370221"},{"fundingName":"Henan Science and Technology Innovation Project","grantNumber":"174100510010"},{"fundingName":"Industry University Research Project of Henan Province","grantNumber":"172107000005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Anomaly Recognition and Autonomic Optimization Method to User\u2019s Sequence Behaviors for D2D Communications in MCC","sourcePdf":"access-zheng-2877423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093341S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications"],"articleId":"8502082","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502084,"authors":[{"name":"Jinming Wen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, and the College of Cyber Security, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8502084/wen-2877460-small.gif","p":["Jinming Wen received the bachelor\u2019s degree in information and computing science from the Jilin Institute of Chemical Technology, Jilin, China, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree in pure mathematics from the Mathematics Institute, Jilin University, Jilin, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from McGill University, Montreal, Canada, in 2015.

The extraordinary wave engineering provided by such slabs is comprised of unidirectional wavefront shaping, nonreciprocal frequency generation, and spatial decomposition of ST harmonics (STHs). We first derive a rigorous analytical solution for the wave scattering from general ST permittivity- and permeability-modulated (STP&PM) slabs. The analytical solution considers the most general form of spatiotemporal variation and wave incidence, i.e., oblique incidence and scattering from time-periodic spatially aperiodic/periodic STP&PM slabs. The spatial aperiodicity may be utilized for further spectrum engineering and suppression of undesired STHs. Next, it will be shown that an equilibrated ST refractive-index-modulated slab with equal permittivity and permeability modulation strengths exhibits highly enhanced nonreciprocity. The FDTD numerical simulation of general STM slabs is presented, providing extra leverage for the analyses of wave propagation and scattering in such media. We show that oblique incidence to an STM slab yields nonreciprocal spatial decomposition of generated STHs. The explored peculiar properties of STM slabs under oblique incidence is expected to pave the way for the realization of new class of subharmonic generators, radars, illusion cloaks, and spatial mixers and isolators.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8613096/08502085.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8613096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2877394","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2877394","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502085","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slabs","Media","Permeability","Permittivity","Antennas","Modulation","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","invisibility cloaks","permeability","permittivity","refractive index","slabs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["obliquely illuminated space-time-modulated slab","advanced wave engineering technique","unidirectional frequency generation","general space-time-modulated","extraordinary wave engineering","unidirectional wavefront shaping","nonreciprocal frequency generation","ST harmonics","rigorous analytical solution","wave scattering","general ST permittivity","permeability-modulated slabs","general form","spatiotemporal variation","wave incidence","oblique incidence","time-periodic spatially aperiodic/periodic STP&PM","spectrum engineering","undesired STHs","equilibrated ST refractive-index-modulated slab","equal permittivity","permeability modulation strengths","general STM slabs","wave propagation","generated STHs","subharmonic generators","spatial mixers","isolators","nonreciprocal spatial decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Permeability","permeability","refractive index","scattering","slab","space\u2013time modulation (STM)","wave engineering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Wave Engineering via Obliquely Illuminated Space-Time-Modulated Slab","accessionNumber":"18409954","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502085/","volume":"67","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Wave Engineering via Obliquely Illuminated Space-Time-Modulated Slab","sourcePdf":"tap-taravati-2877394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09022S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8613096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8613096","articleId":"8502085","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502093,"authors":[{"name":"Zhipeng Xue","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8566078/8502093/xue-2876621-small.gif","p":["Zhipeng Xue received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2015.

noise source, much like amplified spontaneous emission and nonlinear interference. In this framework, we emphasize that the step size of a numerical simulation targeting a given error on the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) should be launch-power independent, and should scale inversely with the square of the signal bandwidth. From this we conclude that the commonly used nonlinear phase criterion for the step update along the distance is not optimal due to its power dependence and its unawareness of signal bandwidth. We propose a general criterion, based on four-wave mixing control, to set the first step of a series of exponentially increasing steps at the desired received SNR accuracy. Finally, we discuss the behavior of the SSFM accuracy versus step-size showing that at practical accuracies of interest the well-known arguments based on the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula may not hold, and explain how to set up a correct SSFM simulation to target an acceptable SNR error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Accuracy of Split-Step Fourier Simulations for Wideband Nonlinear Optical Communications","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2877384","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8520944/08502098.pdf","startPage":"5669","endPage":"5677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2877384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2018","displayDocTitle":"On the Accuracy of Split-Step Fourier Simulations for Wideband Nonlinear Optical Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/8502098/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"18243414","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Accuracy of Split-Step Fourier Simulations for Wideband Nonlinear Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"jlt-musetti-2877384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078658S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8520944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8520944","articleId":"8502098","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502099,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["Bytedance Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8511005/8502099/kzhan-2877355-small.gif","p":["Kai Zhang (M\u201917) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2011.

AMC in JEM employs a 4-parameter affine model between the current block and its reference block. With this model, the motion vectors (MV) of each sub-block can be derived from the MVs at two control points. In this paper, we present a practical framework to further improve the AMC in JEM. First, we introduce a multi-model AMC approach, which allows the encoder to select either the 4-parameter affine model or the 6-parameter affine model adaptively. Second, we improve the affine inter-mode in two aspects. For the normative part, we present an efficient affine motion coding method, which replaces the affine MV Prediction (MVP) candidates in JEM with more accurate but simpler ones, and employs a second-order MVP. For the non-normative part, we enhance the motion estimation process for AMC, by regulating the optimization algorithm. Finally, we propose to unify the affine merge-mode and the normal merge-mode into a unified merge-mode, which combine affine merge candidates and normal merge candidates in a single merge candidate list. Partial of these methods have been adopted into the next generation video coding standard named Versatile Video Coding. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can achieve 1.67% BD rate savings in average for the random access configurations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8511005/08502099.pdf","startPage":"1456","endPage":"1469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2877355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2877355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Framework of Affine Motion Compensation in Video Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Standards","Motion compensation","Adaptation models","Encoding","Decoding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","motion compensation","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine motion compensation","promising coding tool","JEM","4-parameter affine model","motion vectors","multimodel AMC approach","6-parameter affine model","affine inter-mode","efficient affine motion coding method","affine MV Prediction candidates","motion estimation process","affine merge-mode","joint video exploration team","versatile video coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video coding","affine","JEM","VVC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Framework of Affine Motion Compensation in Video Coding","volume":"28","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8502099/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18241598","pubMedId":"30346285","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005144","fundingName":"Qualcomm"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Framework of Affine Motion Compensation in Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tip-zhang-2877355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149097S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8511005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8511005","articleId":"8502099","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502108,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Sepahvand","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8585164/8502108/sepah-2877360-small.gif","p":["Majid Sepahvand received the M.Sc. degree in software engineering from Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran, in 2015, with a thesis on Hand Written Character Recognition Using Inertial Sensors, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering.

One of the important challenges for the progress in this area is the storage, transmission, and processing of large quantities of inertial sensors signal. To address this issue, this paper presents a method for near-lossless compression of multi-axis inertial signals. To improve the inertial signal compression capability, the proposed compression method employs the independent component analysis method with a principal component analysis preprocessing step to extract independent components from the signals. A deep autoencoder is used to compress the independent components and later to estimate them in the reconstruction phase. The reconstruction error is also quantized and coded using arithmetic coding and transmitted alongside the compressed components. This paper also proposes a new approach for improving the quality of the reconstructed signals. In this approach, on the receiver side, the reconstruction error is fed to the Madgwick filter as an external noise and is compensated using this filter. The experimental results demonstrate the high compression rate and low reconstruction error of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

put forward a method of numerical optimization for the circular-aperture time-modulated grid array. The amplitude weight and the time modulation pulsewidth are optimized based on a differential evolution algorithm to get the needed array pattern. Adopting the weighting mode of the conventional rectangular array, the equivalent weighting of a circular-aperture time-modulated array is decomposed into two independent components, respectively, in the horizontal and vertical directions, so as to shorten the length of the optimization vector from M \u00d7 N order to M + N order. Besides, the circular-aperture time-modulated array is symmetrically excited in the horizontal and vertical directions. The numerical experiments show that the differential evolution algorithm can realize a sidelobe level of -35 dB and a nulling level of -60 dB in the patterns of the center frequency and one chosen sideband, and the unexploited sidebands are also suppressed with their peak levels lower than -35 dB. Meanwhile, the dynamic range of the amplitude weighting and the time modulation pulsewidth can be limited to 10 dB. The overall efficiency of the time-modulated array is 0.28.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18285359","htmlLink":"/document/8502110/","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming Optimization for Time-Modulated Circular-Aperture Grid Array With DE Algorithm","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Topnotch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","grantNumber":"TAPPPPZY2015A035"},{"fundingName":"Aviation Science Foundation","grantNumber":"20140169001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming Optimization for Time-Modulated Circular-Aperture Grid Array With DE Algorithm","sourcePdf":"lawp-jiang-2877470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08848S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"8552698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8552698","articleId":"8502110","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502111,"authors":[{"name":"Ai-Min Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Engineering Calculation in Tangshan City, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502111/yang-2877428-small.gif","p":["Ai-Min Yang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Yanshan University in 2002, 2004, and 2015, respectively.

In this paper, we propose multiscale single image super-resolution (SR) based on dilated convolutions. We adopt dilated convolutions to expand the receptive field size without incurring additional computational complexity. We mix standard convolutions and dilated convolutions in each layer, called mixed convolutions, i.e., in the mixed convolutional layer, and the feature extracted by dilated convolutions and standard convolutions are concatenated. We theoretically analyze the receptive field and intensity of mixed convolutions to discover their role in SR. Mixed convolutions remove blind spots and capture the correlation between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs successfully, thus achieving good generalization ability. We verify those properties of mixed convolutions by training 5-layer and 10-layer networks. We also train a 20-layer deep network to compare the performance of the proposed method with those of the state-of-the-art ones. Moreover, we jointly learn maps with different scales from a LR image to its HR one in a single network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of PSNR and SSIM, especially for a large-scale factor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCSR: Dilated Convolutions for Single Image Super-Resolution","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2877483","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8548629/08502129.pdf","startPage":"1625","endPage":"1635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2877483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8548629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"DCSR: Dilated Convolutions for Single Image Super-Resolution","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8502129/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18286381","pubMedId":"30346286","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872280"},{"fundingName":"International S&T Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFG12780"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCSR: Dilated Convolutions for Single Image Super-Resolution","sourcePdf":"tip-jung-2877483-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084108S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8548629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8548629","articleId":"8502129","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502134,"authors":[{"name":"Venkatesan Guruswami","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Venkatesan Guruswami received his Bachelor\u2019s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras in 1997 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001.

The aim is to find the shortest index code that minimizes the total number of coded bits sent by the senders. In this paper, built on the classic single-sender minrank concept, we develop a new rank-minimization framework for MSUIC that explicitly takes into account the sender message constraints and minimizes the sum of the ranks of encoding matrices subject to the receiver decoding requirements. This framework provides a systematic way to construct multi-sender linear index codes and to study their capability in achieving the shortest index codelength per message length (i.e., the optimal broadcast rate). In particular, we establish the optimal broadcast rate for all critical MSUIC instances with up to four receivers and show that a binary linear index code is optimal for all, except 15 instances with four receivers. We also propose a heuristic algorithm (in lieu of exhaustive search) to solve the rank-minimization problem. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated by numerical studies of MSUIC instances with four or more receivers.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08502138.pdf","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Sender Index Coding for Collaborative Broadcasting: A Rank-Minimization Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Sender Index Coding for Collaborative Broadcasting: A Rank-Minimization Approach","volume":"67","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8502138/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18467822","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502138/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FT140100219 and DP150100903"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Sender Index Coding for Collaborative Broadcasting: A Rank-Minimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tcomm-li-2877392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.283347S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8502138","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502139,"authors":[{"name":"Huy Phan","affiliation":["University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, GB"],"firstName":"Huy","lastName":"Phan","orcid":"0000-0003-4096-785X","id":"37086496664"},{"name":"Fernando Andreotti","affiliation":["University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, GB"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Andreotti","orcid":"0000-0001-6868-4718","id":"37085335304"},{"name":"Navin Cooray","affiliation":["University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, GB"],"firstName":"Navin","lastName":"Cooray","id":"37086497083"},{"name":"Oliver Y.

This paper proposes a joint classification-and-prediction framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic sleep staging, and, subsequently, introduces a simple yet efficient CNN architecture to power the framework. Given a single input epoch, the novel framework jointly determines its label (classification) and its neighboring epochs' labels (prediction) in the contextual output. While the proposed framework is orthogonal to the widely adopted classification schemes, which take one or multiple epochs as contextual inputs and produce a single classification decision on the target epoch, we demonstrate its advantages in several ways. First, it leverages the dependency among consecutive sleep epochs while surpassing the problems experienced with the common classification schemes. Second, even with a single model, the framework has the capacity to produce multiple decisions, which are essential in obtaining a good performance as in ensemble-of-models methods, with very little induced computational overhead. Probabilistic aggregation techniques are then proposed to leverage the availability of multiple decisions. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we conducted experiments on two public datasets: Sleep-EDF Expanded (Sleep-EDF), which consists of 20 subjects, and Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) dataset, which consists of 200 subjects. The proposed framework yields an overall classification accuracy of 82.3% and 83.6%, respectively. We also show that the proposed framework not only is superior to the baselines based on the common classification schemes but also outperforms existing deep-learning approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first work going beyond the standard single-output classification to consider multitask neural networks for automatic sleep staging. This framework provides avenues for further studies of different neural-network architectures for automatic sleep staging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","volume":"66","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"18616896","pubMedId":"30346277","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502139/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Classification and Prediction CNN Framework for Automatic Sleep Stage Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013373","fundingName":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010269","fundingName":"Wellcome Trust","grantNumber":"098461/Z/12/Z"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Classification and Prediction CNN Framework for Automatic Sleep Stage Classification","sourcePdf":"tbme-phan-2872652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131059S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8694044","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8694044","articleId":"8502139","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502141,"authors":[{"name":"Jianguo Chen","affiliation":["National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/8685251/8502141/chen-2877359-small.gif","p":["Jianguo Chen received the PhD degree from the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, China.

However, the training process of CNNs is very time-consuming, where large amounts of training samples and iterative operations are required to obtain high-quality weight parameters. In this paper, we focus on the time-consuming training process of large-scale CNNs and propose a Bi-layered Parallel Training (BPT-CNN) architecture in distributed computing environments. BPT-CNN consists of two main components: (a) an outer-layer parallel training for multiple CNN subnetworks on separate data subsets, and (b) an inner-layer parallel training for each subnetwork. In the outer-layer parallelism, we address critical issues of distributed and parallel computing, including data communication, synchronization, and workload balance. A heterogeneous-aware Incremental Data Partitioning and Allocation (IDPA) strategy is proposed, where large-scale training datasets are partitioned and allocated to the computing nodes in batches according to their computing power. To minimize the synchronization waiting during the global weight update process, an Asynchronous Global Weight Update (AGWU) strategy is proposed. In the inner-layer parallelism, we further accelerate the training process for each CNN subnetwork on each computer, where computation steps of convolutional layer and the local weight training are parallelized based on task-parallelism. We introduce task decomposition and scheduling strategies with the objectives of thread-level load balancing and minimum waiting time for critical paths. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed BPT-CNN effectively improves the training performance of CNNs while maintaining the accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18598705","htmlLink":"/document/8502141/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","volume":"30","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Bi-layered Parallel Training Architecture for Large-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0200201"},{"fundingName":"National Outstanding Youth Science Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61625202"},{"fundingName":"International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program","grantNumber":"2018024"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018T110829"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-1526499, IIS-1763325 and CNS-1626432"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61672313"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bi-layered Parallel Training Architecture for Large-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tpds-chen-2877359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145402S","chronDate":"May 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8685251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8685251","articleId":"8502141","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502143,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Leturc","affiliation":["Thales Communications & Security, Gennevilliers, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8577058/8502143/letur-2877507-small.gif","p":["Xavier Leturc was born in Alen\u00e7on, France, in 1992.

The RA is performed considering the Rayleigh channel, and assuming that only statistical channel state information is available, which fits well device-to-device (D2D) communications setup. Moreover, the use of practical modulation and coding schemes is taken into account. We formulate several RA problems with different EE criteria, subject to constraints on the minimum goodput and the maximum transmit power per-link. Based on a packet error probability approximation, we provide a framework which allows us to derive algorithms maximizing most of the common EE criteria, namely the sum of the EE of the links, the product of the EE, the EE of the link with the worst EE, and the EE of the whole network. The complexity of the proposed algorithms is also provided. The performance related to each criterion are evaluated through simulations and ranked according to the network configurations. We also illustrate on a practical example the real effectiveness of the EE criterion to achieve a better user experience than other common criteria such as the maximum sum rate and the minimum transmit power.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8577058/08502143.pdf","startPage":"11936","endPage":"11949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2877507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2877507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for HARQ With Statistical CSI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Optimization","Resource management","Transmitters","Automatic repeat request","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel allocation","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation problem","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","single carrier frequency division multiple access","hybrid automatic repeat request","HARQ","energy efficiency","Rayleigh channel","statistical channel state information","device-to-device communications setup","coding schemes","RA problems","maximum transmit power per-link","packet error probability approximation","energy-efficient resource allocation","statistical CSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HARQ","energy efficiency","resource allocation","fractional programming","geometric programming","successive convex approximation","alternating optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for HARQ With Statistical CSI","volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8502143/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18344988","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for HARQ With Statistical CSI","sourcePdf":"tvt-leturc-2877507-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119929S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8502143","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502144,"authors":[{"name":"Kenan Turbic","affiliation":["INESC-ID/Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502144/turbi-2877500-small.gif","p":["Kenan Turbic was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1988.

Motion is represented as a composition of a linear forward movement plus a periodic component, modeled by a Fourier series with up to two harmonics. The model is simple, yet realistic, as Motion Capture (MoCap) data are used to calculate its parameters. It is suitable for use with a variety of propagation channel models, including deterministic ray-tracing and stochastic geometry-based ones, but can also allow for analytical inference in simplified scenarios. Considering an off-body communication scenario, simulations show that the proposed mobility model provides similar received power as the skeleton-based model with MoCap data, the maximum difference in the considered scenario being below 1 dB. A significant influence of user's motion on the channel is observed for both free-space and multipath propagation, yielding received power variations up to 28 dB in the considered scenarios.","topic":"Wireless Body Area Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18495581","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502144/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Mobility Model for Wearable Antennas on Dynamic Users","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"COST Action CA15104, IRACON"},{"fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/00066/2013"},{"fundingName":"Project Forester","grantNumber":"PCIF/SSI/0102/2017"},{"fundingName":"Program Investigador FCT","grantNumber":"IF/00325/2015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Mobility Model for Wearable Antennas on Dynamic Users","sourcePdf":"access-turbic-2877500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107061S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Wireless Body Area Networks"],"articleId":"8502144","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502148,"authors":[{"name":"Min Shi","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/8685251/8502148/shi-2877363-small.gif","p":["Min Shi (S\u201915) received the MS degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China.

In the past, various methods have been proposed to facilitate the service selection process based on the original functional descriptions. However, the mined features from the descriptions are usually too sparse for training a well-performed model. In addition, most methods neglect to differentiate the weights of various features, while words included in descriptions usually exhibit different intentions (e.g., functional or non-functional). To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a text expansion and deep model-based approach for service recommendation. Specifically, we first expand the description of services at sentence level based on a novel probabilistic topic model that learns topics of words, sentences and descriptions in a stratified fashion. The expansion process can bridge the vocabulary gap between services and user queries with the collective semantic similarity of sentences and descriptions. Then, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory-based model to recommend services with two attention mechanisms - a functional attention mechanism that takes tags as functional prior to mine the function-related features of services and Mashups, and a contextual attention mechanism that considers Mashup requirements as application scenario to help select the most appropriate services. We evaluate the proposed approach on a real-world dataset and the results show it has an improvement of 34 percent in F-measure over the basic LSTM model.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2018.2877363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2018.2877363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/8685251/08502148.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8685251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"Functional and Contextual Attention-Based LSTM for Service Recommendation in Mashup Creation","volume":"30","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18598696","htmlLink":"/document/8502148/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"1 May 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Florida Center for Cybersecurity","grantNumber":"FC2"},{"fundingName":"Walter and Lalita Janke Innovations in Sustainability Science Research Fund","grantNumber":"N_PolyU519/12"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872139 and 61572187"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional and Contextual Attention-Based LSTM for Service Recommendation in Mashup Creation","sourcePdf":"tpds-tang-2877363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.252043S","chronDate":"May 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8685251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8685251","articleId":"8502148","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502149,"authors":[{"name":"Chengjun Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/9316344/8502149/cai-2877332-small.gif","p":["Chengjun Cai received the BS degree in computer science and technology from Jinan University, in 2016.

Decentralized storage such as Storj and Sia leverages blockchain to establish an open platform for sharing economy, which provides private and reliable file-outsourcing services. However, the ubiquitous keyword search function over encrypted files is yet to be supported. To enable this function, we first apply searchable encryption techniques to the decentralized setting. But this primitive can hardly ensure the service integrity. The reason is that decentralized storage commonly faces severe threats from both clients and service peers. Service peers may return partial or incorrect results, while clients may intentionally slander the service peers to avoid payments. To address these threats, we utilize the smart contract to record the logs of encrypted search (aka evidence) on the blockchain, and devise a fair protocol to handle disputes and issue fair payments. Using a dynamic-efficient searchable encryption scheme as an instantiation, we craft a concrete scheme that preserves encrypted search capability and enforces ecosystem healthiness, so that service peers are incentivized to make real efforts and jointly guarantee service reliability. We implement our scheme in Python and Solidity, and test its search performance and transaction costs on Ethereum.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2018.2877332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2018.2877332","startPage":"131","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure

distributed computing problem of multiplying a matrix by a set of vectors. The first scheme is based on partitioning the matrix into submatrices and applying maximum distance separable (MDS) codes to each submatrix. For this scheme, we prove that up to a given number of partitions the communication load and the computational delay (not including the encoding and decoding delay) are identical to those of the scheme recently proposed by Li et al., based on a single, long MDS code. However, due to the use of shorter MDS codes, our scheme yields a significantly lower overall computational delay when the delay incurred by encoding and decoding is also considered. We further propose a second coded scheme based on Luby transform (LT) codes under inactivation decoding. Interestingly, LT codes may reduce the delay over the partitioned scheme at the expense of an increased communication load. We also consider distributed computing under a deadline and show numerically that the proposed schemes outperform other schemes in the literature, with the LT code-based scheme yielding the best performance for the scenarios considered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","volume":"67","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"18527991","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502151/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Block-Diagonal and LT Codes for Distributed Computing With Straggling Servers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det","grantNumber":"2016-04253"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005416","fundingName":"Norges Forskningsr\u00e5d","grantNumber":"240985/F20"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Diagonal and LT Codes for Distributed Computing With Straggling Servers","sourcePdf":"tcomm-severinson-2877391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183145S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8667745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8667745","articleId":"8502151","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502153,"authors":[{"name":"Yuyu Yin","affiliation":["School of Computer, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502153/yin-2877137-small.gif","p":["Yuyu Yin (M\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Zhejiang University in 2010.

Considering this, recommending useful services to users is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Collaborative filtering (CF) approaches have been successfully adopted for services recommendation. Nevertheless, the prediction accuracy of the existing CF approaches is likely to reduce due to many reasons, such as inability to use side information and high data sparsity, which further lead to low quality of services recommendation. In order to solve these problems, some model-based CF approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a novel quality of service prediction approach based on probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF), which has the capability of incorporating network location (an important factor in mobile computing) and implicit associations among users and services. First, we propose a novel clustering method that is capable of utilizing network location to cluster users. Based on the clustering results, we further propose an enhanced PMF model. The proposed model also incorporates the implicit associations among users and services. In addition, our model incorporates the implicit relationships between the users and the services. We conducted experiments on one real-world data set, and the experimental results show that our model outperforms the compared methods.","topic":"Mobile Service Computing with Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18582975","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502153/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Location-Aware Service Recommendation With Enhanced Probabilistic Matrix Factorization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2017YFB1400601"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702391"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY12F02003"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2018JQ6050"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities","grantNumber":"JBX171007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Location-Aware Service Recommendation With Enhanced Probabilistic Matrix Factorization","sourcePdf":"access-yin-2877137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081357S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Mobile Service Computing with Internet of Things"],"articleId":"8502153","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502159,"authors":[{"name":"Donato Impedovo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bari, Bari, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/9372348/8502159/imped-2865345-small.gif","p":["DONATO IMPEDOVO (M'08-SM'17) received the MEng degree cum laude in computer engineering and the PhD degree in computer engineering.

Since its theoretical analysis was introduced by Minorsky nearly 100 years ago [1], it has been explained primarily by its representation in the Positional form of the equation. This paper will present the PID algorithm as a PVA (Position, Velocity, Acceleration) algorithm, which explains the theory based on the Velocity instead of the Positional form of the equation. PVA is not a new controller but a different representation of the PID from a Velocity instead of Positional view. The paper does not intend to suggest that the implementation of controllers should change from PID to PVA; only that PVA provides a more intuitive way to introduce the theory so that engineers better understand how to configure and tune PID control loops. Despite a long history of teaching the Positional form, and implementation of the Positional (PID) form in control systems, the Velocity (PVA) form offers a way to introduce the algorithm in a more familiar and understandable way to engineering students and practicing engineers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502191/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18194869","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502191/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Coming to Terms with PID","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coming to Terms with PID","confLoc":"Appleton, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"2018-PPIC-0314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073979S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8424854","isNumber":"8502184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8424854","xplore-issue":"8502184","articleId":"8502191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502208,"authors":[{"name":"Raghad Al-Shabandar","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502208/alsha-2876755-small.gif","p":["Raghad Al-Shabandar received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Al-Mustansiriya, Iraq, and the M.Sc. degree in information system from Liverpool John Moores, U.K., in 2014, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Faculty of Engineering and Technology.

The opportunity of accessing high quality courseware content within such platforms, while eliminating the burden of educational, financial, and geographical obstacles has led to a rapid growth in participant numbers. The increasing number and diversity of participating learners has opened up new horizons to the research community for the investigation of effective learning environments. Learning Analytics has been used to investigate the impact of engagement on student performance. However, the extensive literature review indicates that there is little research on the impact of MOOCs, particularly in analyzing the link between behavioral engagement and motivation as predictors of learning outcomes. In this paper, we consider a dataset, which originates from online courses provided by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, delivered through the edX platform. Two sets of empirical experiments are conducted using both statistical and machine learning techniques. Statistical methods are used to examine the association between engagement level and performance, including the consideration of learner educational backgrounds. The results indicate a significant gap between success and failure outcome learner groups, where successful learners are found to read and watch course material to a higher degree. Machine learning algorithms are used to automatically detect learners who are lacking in motivation at an early time in the course, thus providing instructors with insight in regards to student withdrawal.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502208.pdf","startPage":"73669","endPage":"73685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing Learners Behavior in MOOCs: An Examination of Performance and Motivation Using a Data-Driven Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing Learners Behavior in MOOCs: An Examination of Performance and Motivation Using a Data-Driven Approach","htmlLink":"/document/8502208/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2018","publicationDate":"2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analyzing Learners Behavior in MOOCs: An Examination of Performance and Motivation Using a Data-Driven Approach","sourcePdf":"access-hussain-2876755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100941S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502208","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502210,"authors":[{"name":"Kohki Shibahara","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Kohki Shibahara (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in physics, the M.S. degree in geophysics, and the Ph.D. degree in informatics from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2008, 2010, and 2017, respectively.

Mode-division multiplexed signals exhibit different transmission behavior depending on excited spatial modes in the presence of mode-relevant physical phenomena including DMD and mode-dependent loss (MDL). In weakly coupled FMF transmission over long distance where overall DMD and MDL grow almost linearly with fiber length, these phenomena restrict achievable information capacity and/or transmission reach. This paper presents a newly developed transmission scheme and a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal processing technique that are designed for achieving long-haul FMF transmission. Permutating spatial channels cyclically at each span induced quasi-strongly coupled transmission regime and hence significantly suppressed DMD-induced pulse broadening. Layered MIMO signal processing comprising multiple stages performing successive signal detection and intermodal interference canceling mitigated MDL impact with more than 2-dB Q-factor improvement. The combined use of these techniques enabled us to achieve the first-ever transoceanic-class long-haul FMF transmission.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2877213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2877213","startPage":"138","endPage":"147","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8632872/08502210.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8632872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DMD-Unmanaged Long-Haul SDM Transmission Over 2500-km 12-Core \u00d7 3-Mode MC-FMF and 6300-km 3-Mode FMF Employing Intermodal Interference Canceling Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"DMD-Unmanaged Long-Haul SDM Transmission Over 2500-km 12-Core \u00d7 3-Mode MC-FMF and 6300-km 3-Mode FMF Employing Intermodal Interference Canceling Technique","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2019","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2019","volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8502210/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18438781","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502210/","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"DMD-Unmanaged Long-Haul SDM Transmission Over 2500-km 12-Core \u00d7 3-Mode MC-FMF and 6300-km 3-Mode FMF Employing Intermodal Interference Canceling Technique","sourcePdf":"jlt-shibahara-2877213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076454S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8632872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8632872","articleId":"8502210","onlineDate":"22 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8502214,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaopeng Zhong","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085465484"},{"name":"Qian Yu","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086491755"},{"name":"Amine Bermak","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Amine","lastName":"Bermak","id":"37275353200"},{"name":"Chi-Ying Tsui","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chi-Ying","lastName":"Tsui","id":"37278549800"},{"name":"May-Kay Law","affiliation":["University of Macau, Macau"],"firstName":"May-Kay","lastName":"Law","id":"37086489167"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4214-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4215-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2158-5601"}],"articleNumber":"8502214","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":491},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Feature extraction","Image edge detection","Histograms","CMOS image sensors","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","edge detection","feature extraction","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional local binary pattern extraction","edge detection","energy-efficient multimode CMOS image sensor","normal imaging","group-switchable multiinput multioutput comparator","mixed-signal processing circuits","multimode operations","prototype sensor","high-accuracy on-chip LBP-E","MIMO processing","full 8-direction LBP-E","energy-efficient column-parallel GC","group computation scheme","mixed-signal 4-pixel CG scheme","power 12.7 muW","energy 2.0 pJ","energy 3.9 pJ","size 0.18 mum","power 6.5 muW"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an energy-efficient multi-mode CMOS image sensor featuring omnidirectional local binary pattern extraction (LBP-E), edge detection (ED) and normal imaging.

The project was designed and executed in four phases that lasted a total of three years. The first phase of the project replaced the original four master controllers with new state-of-the-art controllers, which were compatible with the communication protocols of the existing drive system. The subsequent three phases of the project replaced the existing drives, all from a mix of different manufacturers, with a new modern drive system. In total, 142 drives were installed, commissioned, and tuned during the course of this upgrade. A challenge was presented by continuing to operate with the unique combination of existing drives, from different manufacturers, and new drives during the phases of the project. The staged design of the project helped reduce the outage time impact. This Paper Machine upgrade project was completed ahead of schedule and has exceeded the expectation of a successful upgrade.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502219/","conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18194876","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502219/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Phased Paper Machine Drive & Control System Upgrade","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Phased Paper Machine Drive & Control System Upgrade","confLoc":"Appleton, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"2018-PPIC-0307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029298S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8424854","isNumber":"8502184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8424854","xplore-issue":"8502184","articleId":"8502219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502220,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis K.

Preventive maintenance of electrical equipment, specifically with regard to power circuit breakers, is often overlooked or is performed infrequently or inadequately. This paper provides insights into the typical maintenance requirements for power circuit breakers, both low- and medium-voltage. Also addressed is the potential impact on the arc flash incident energy when maintenance is not performed. An unintentional time delay in the operation of a circuit breaker due to a sticky operating mechanism can cause the incident energy of an arc flash to rise, sometimes dramatically.","doi":"10.1109/PPIC.2018.8502220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PPIC.2018.8502220","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE IAS Pulp, Paper and Forest Industries Conference (PPFIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE IAS Pulp, Paper and Forest Industries Conference (PPFIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8424854/8502184/08502220.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Typical Power Circuit Breaker Maintenance Considerations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Typical Power Circuit Breaker Maintenance Considerations","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502220/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18194862","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502220/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Typical Power Circuit Breaker Maintenance Considerations","confLoc":"Appleton, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"2018-PPIC-0304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057125S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8424854","isNumber":"8502184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8424854","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8502184","articleId":"8502220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502224,"authors":[{"name":"Del John Ventruella","affiliation":["High Voltage Maintenance Corporation, Dayton, OH, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Del John Ventruella completed the BSEE degree at The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and the MSEE degree at The University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Proper sizing involves consideration of fault and overload conditions that are possible. The basis for such sizing is commonly derived from NEC limits. These NEC imposed limits are the legal limits, but direct application of these maximum values to size transformer primary side fuses is ill-advised. The primary side fuse for medium voltage (MV) applications greater than 1000 volts, as with most MV protective devices, is not intended to provide overload protection. That is achieved by design (considering the intended loading on the transformer). The National Electrical Code recognizes this by permitting the fuse to be sized up to 300 percent of the transformer full load ampere rating. It is generally not a good idea to apply the NEC as an absolute standard for fuse sizing to protect transformers in the absence of the application of other techniques (such as plotting the ANSI/IEEE thermal-mechanical damage characteristic for transformers on a time current curve along with the primary side (MV) fuse time current curve characteristic). These considerations are discussed in the course of this paper. The focus here is on dry type, low voltage (LV) transformers, although the content can be easily extended to liquid filled transformers by using the equations from the appropriate standard.","doi":"10.1109/PPIC.2018.8502224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PPIC.2018.8502224","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE IAS Pulp, Paper and Forest Industries Conference (PPFIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE IAS Pulp, Paper and Forest Industries Conference (PPFIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8424854/8502184/08502224.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformer Fuse Sizing - The NEC is not the Last Word","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Transformer Fuse Sizing - The NEC is not the Last Word","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502224/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18194867","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502224/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformer Fuse Sizing - The NEC is not the Last Word","confLoc":"Appleton, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"2018-PPIC-0299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053927S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8424854","isNumber":"8502184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8424854","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8502184","articleId":"8502224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8502227,"authors":[{"name":"Richard C.

Where applicable, the generator and excitation system are required go through a series of tests for model validation. These tests can be quite time consuming and expensive. Not all paper mills are required to comply, but some may be directed to do so by the utility because of their machine's size, its relative interconnection to the system, and how and where the generator output is directed. [1] One feature for modern excitation systems is a Power System Stabilizer (PSS). The PSS is used on machines 25 MVA or larger where power system stability issues develop on voltage-weak systems and where NERC compliance applies. Power system stability is generally an issue in the western United States depending upon the power plant's location. The PSS augments the control of the excitation system to dampen MW oscillations after a system disturbance. This paper discusses the testing expectations for modeling NERC-compliant plants and the strategies for tuning a PSS.

Engineers and technicians understand the DC motor structure and components. They also have experience in rebuilding, testing, and making performance adjustments to the DC machines. Those that truly understand commutation, the commutation zone, and the characteristics of the carbon brush are, alas, few in number. Traditionally, the lack of a visible arc has been the defining quality for good commutation - hence the term \u201cblack\u201d. The lack of proper understanding and relatively high-level physical science involved has led to the art of achieving this condition being nicknamed \u201cBlack Magic\u201d. It is a reference to both the brush coloration, and commutation. The purpose of this paper is to define the commutating zone and present the critical components that create the zone. An explanation of specific brush properties and their contribution to successful commutation is included.","doi":"10.1109/PPIC.2018.8502236","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE IAS Pulp, Paper and Forest Industries Conference (PPFIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE IAS Pulp, Paper and Forest Industries Conference (PPFIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8424854/8502184/08502236.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PPIC.2018.8502236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Secret to that Old Black Magic - Commutation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"The Secret to that Old Black Magic - Commutation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502236/","publicationDate":"June 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18194864","htmlLink":"/document/8502236/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Secret to that Old Black Magic - Commutation","confLoc":"Appleton, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"2018-PPIC-0309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047614S","chronDate":"17-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8424854","isNumber":"8502184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8424854","xplore-issue":"8502184","articleId":"8502236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502260,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Chun Shih","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Chun","lastName":"Shih","id":"37086350118"},{"name":"Chia-Fu Lee","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Fu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37696405900"},{"name":"Yen-An Chang","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-An","lastName":"Chang","id":"37086489110"},{"name":"Po-Hao Lee","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Hao","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086490223"},{"name":"Hon-Jarn Lin","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hon-Jarn","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086336912"},{"name":"Yu-Lin Chen","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086491334"},{"name":"Ku-Feng Lin","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ku-Feng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37536164600"},{"name":"Ta-Ching Yeh","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ta-Ching","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37086489065"},{"name":"Hung-Chang Yu","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Chang","lastName":"Yu","id":"38581102300"},{"name":"Harry Chuang","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37085831273"},{"name":"Yu-Der Chih","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Der","lastName":"Chih","id":"37390898600"},{"name":"Jonathan Chang","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37716411500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4214-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4215-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2158-5601"}],"articleNumber":"8502260","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":935},"abstract":"A new MRAM reference and sensing circuit that can achieve <; \u00b11\u03bcA resolution and 17.5nS read access from -40C to 125C is presented in this paper.

A transformer-based LC-PLL sends a single-phase differential clock to the voltage-mode transmitter and the receiver. Local multi-phase clocks are generated in each TX/RX lane to support digital phase interpolation. The receiver equalization consists of a single-stage CTLE that performs both high-frequency peaking and long-tail cancellation, a two-stage programmable gain amplifier, and a 15-tap DFE. The digital CDR achieves <;14ns lock time in a synchronous burst-mode operation. At 28Gb/s, the transceiver achieves <;1E-15 BER over 30dB channel while consuming

Acceleration for Fully Connected Layers","abstract":"Neural Networks (NNs) have emerged as a fundamental technology for machine learning. The sparsity of weight and activation in NNs varies widely from 5%-90% and can potentially lower computation requirements. However, existing designs lack a universal solution to efficiently handle different sparsity in various layers and neural networks. This work, named STICKER, first systematically explores NN sparsity for inference and online tuning operations. Its major contributions are: 1) autonomous NN sparsity detector that switches the processor modes; 2) Multi-sparsity compatible Convolution (CONV) PE arrays that contain a multi-mode memory supporting different sparsity, and the set-associative PEs supporting both dense and sparse operations and reducing 92% memory area compared with previous hash memory banks; 3) Online tuning PE for sparse FCs that achieves 32.5x speedup compared with conventional CPU, using quantization center-based weight updating and Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) based back propagations. Peak energy efficiency of the 65nm STICKER chip is up to 62.1 TOPS/W at 8bit data length.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502404/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18196258","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502404/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sticker: A 0.41-62.1 TOPS/W 8Bit Neural Network Processor with Multi-Sparsity Compatible Convolution Arrays and Online Tuning Acceleration for Fully Connected Layers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sticker: A 0.41-62.1 TOPS/W 8Bit Neural Network Processor with Multi-Sparsity Compatible Convolution Arrays and Online Tuning Acceleration for Fully Connected Layers","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"c04-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091307S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484863","isNumber":"8502213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484863","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"8502213","articleId":"8502404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502405,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Snakowska","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Snakowska","id":"37086489658"},{"name":"Karolina Kolber","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Karolina","lastName":"Kolber","id":"37086489323"},{"name":"\u0141ukasz Gorazd","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"\u0141ukasz","lastName":"Gorazd","id":"37086490308"},{"name":"Jerzy Jurkiewicz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Automatics, Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Jurkiewicz","id":"38229049000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7114-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7113-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7115-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8502405","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ducts","Scattering","Acoustics","Exhaust systems","Junctions","Generators","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic field","acoustic noise","acoustic signal processing","acoustic wave propagation","acoustic wave transmission","silencers","S-matrix theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-mode generator","acoustic monopoles","scattering matrix formalism","acoustical systems","acoustic mufflers","multimode wave propagation","acoustic two-port scattering matrix","independent sound fieldduct-like elements","noise reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["circular duct","multimode wave","two-port approach","muffler","scattering matrix","single-mode generator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502405","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Joint Conference - Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488333/8502215/08502405.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACOUSTICS.2018.8502405","doi":"10.1109/ACOUSTICS.2018.8502405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502215","publicationTitle":"2018 Joint Conference - Acoustics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Derivation of an Acoustic Two-Port Scattering Matrix for a Multimode Wave Applying the Single-Mode Generator","abstract":"The paper presents the procedure of experimental derivation of an acoustic two-port scattering matrix for a multimode wave propagating, for example, in a muffler of a complicated design, applying the single-mode generator. The self-designed single-mode generator is constructed in the form of a matrix of acoustic monopoles and is capable to generate a selected single mode. The scattering matrix formalism is a new approach to analyse the acoustical systems containing one or more duct-like elements (joints) connected by some undefined elements such as, for example, acoustic mufflers of different types and so the formalism is frequently applied to analyse the phenomena of noise reduction in such systems. Experimental derivation of the scattering matrix for a wave composed of N modes demands, in general, excitation of N different sound fields at each side of the two-port first. Finally the matrix composed of the modal pressures measurements obtained for each of the exited fields must be inversed to obtain the scattering matrix. Generating single N modes the matrix of the incoming pressure data is, theoretically, diagonal which makes derivation of the scattering matrix much easier. Generation of independent sound fields in the shape of single modes ensures the matrix to be well conditioned.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502405/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18196886","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"September 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502405/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Derivation of an Acoustic Two-Port Scattering Matrix for a Multimode Wave Applying the Single-Mode Generator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Derivation of an Acoustic Two-Port Scattering Matrix for a Multimode Wave Applying the Single-Mode Generator","confLoc":"Ustka, Poland","sourcePdf":"56_PID5587203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074775S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488333","isNumber":"8502215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488333","xplore-issue":"8502215","articleId":"8502405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502408,"authors":[{"name":"Shinzo Koyama","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinzo","lastName":"Koyama","id":"37086489315"},{"name":"Motonori Ishii","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Motonori","lastName":"Ishii","id":"37065260900"},{"name":"Shigeru Saito","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Saito","id":"37086491003"},{"name":"Masato Takemoto","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Takemoto","id":"37088193803"},{"name":"Yugo Nose","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yugo","lastName":"Nose","id":"37681193800"},{"name":"Akito Inoue","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Akito","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37088739515"},{"name":"Yusuke Sakata","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Sakata","id":"37072974100"},{"name":"Yuki Sugiura","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Sugiura","id":"37087619959"},{"name":"Manabu Usuda","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Manabu","lastName":"Usuda","id":"37293803100"},{"name":"Tatsuya Kabe","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Kabe","id":"37088738620"},{"name":"Shigetaka Kasuga","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigetaka","lastName":"Kasuga","id":"37275281100"},{"name":"Mitsuyoshi Mori","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuyoshi","lastName":"Mori","id":"37275299900"},{"name":"Yutaka Hirose","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yutaka","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37424981900"},{"name":"Akihiro Odagawa","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Odagawa","id":"37086091085"},{"name":"Tsuyoshi Tanaka","affiliation":["Panasonic Corp., Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37085715007"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4214-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4215-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2158-5601"}],"articleNumber":"8502408","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":734},"abstract":"We have developed a direct time-of-flight (TOF) 220 m ranging CMOS image sensor (CIS) based on a 688 \u00d7 384 pixel array of vertical avalanche photodiodes.

The recognition performance of penetration for aluminum alloy in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) still needs to be improved to meet the strict industry demands. This paper proposed a novel recognition method, time-frequency image based convolution neural network (TF-CNN), for GTAW penetration recognition. Time-frequency images were calculated from arc sound signals using short time Fourier transform and applied to analyze the non-stationarity of arc sound. The logarithm of time-frequency image was taken to construct the appropriate input matrix of CNN, which was optimized to improve its recognition performance, including the activation function, learning rate and architecture of network. The experimental results show that the proposed TF-CNN achieved an excellent recognition performance with 98.2% recognition accuracy and 0.21 accuracy variance for GTAW seam penetration recognition and outperformed the traditional methods. This paper provides some guidance for the application of CNN to other monitoring signals of intelligent manufacturing.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502478","startPage":"853","endPage":"860","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488382/8502441/08502478.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seam Penetration Recognition for GTAW Using Convolutional Neural Network Based on Time-Frequency Image of Arc Sound","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Welding","Convolution","Feature extraction","Time-frequency analysis","Robot sensing systems","Mechanical engineering","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium alloys","arc welding","convolution","feedforward neural nets","Fourier transforms","image recognition","intelligent manufacturing systems","optimisation","production engineering computing","quality control","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GTAW seam penetration recognition","welding quality","intelligent welding manufacturing","gas tungsten arc welding","TF-CNN","arc sound signals","Fourier transform","online monitoring","aluminum alloy","industry demands","time-frequency image based convolution neural network","matrix input","optimisation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arc sound","convolution neural network","intelligent welding","penetration recognition","time-frequency analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Seam Penetration Recognition for GTAW Using Convolutional Neural Network Based on Time-Frequency Image of Arc Sound","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8502478/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197197","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seam Penetration Recognition for GTAW Using Convolutional Neural Network Based on Time-Frequency Image of Arc Sound","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"0853-tf-003778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07129S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488382","isNumber":"8502441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488382","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8502441","articleId":"8502478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8502481,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Bonini","affiliation":["Synesis Scarl, Lomazzo, CO, Italy"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Bonini","id":"37086492808"},{"name":"Andrea Forni","affiliation":["Synesis Scarl, Lomazzo, CO, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Forni","id":"37086496892"},{"name":"Mauro Mazzolini","affiliation":["Synesis Scarl, Lomazzo, CO, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Mazzolini","id":"37598993800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7108-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7107-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7109-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"8502481","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","manufacturing systems","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent handling system design","product differentiation","product lifecycle","production systems","automation solutions","Big Data","knowledge-based systems technology","artificial intelligence","multiobjective optimization strategies","multilevel optimization strategies","Industry 4.0"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Manufacturing system design","Optimization","Knowledge-based engineering","Genetic Algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502481","abstract":"Increasing product differentiation and shortening of product lifecycle impose a deep change in production systems and automation solutions, moving toward architectures and technologies that enable real time distributed flexibility, rapid reconfiguration and global optimization pursuing specific strategic objectives.

However, the usual presence of several hundreds of similarly looking, but completely different types of blister packages, in a crowded dispensing station makes it prone to human error, posing serious safety and health concerns for a patients life. In this work, we propose a highlighted deep learning (HDL) based approach for accurate identification of blister packages. HDL allows smart manipulation on raw data in order to better segment the identified targets and to expose inherent descriptive features, thus facilitating an accurate deep learning based classification process. Specifically, HDL uses automatic detection and then segments and processes the raw blister pack images irrespective of position, lighting variations, etc., making them suitable for CNN to classify the correct blister pack types. A ResNet CNN classifier has been trained using the processed images, and the resultant CNN model is finally deployed for classification. We have conducted an extensive experiment at the adult lozenge dispensing station of MacKay Memorial Hospital. The database that will be released along with this paper, consists of 272 types of blister packages, with 65 images belonging to each type for training and additional 7 images for validation. On real testing scenario, the proposed approach yielded almost 100% accuracy, consistently over the entire testing set. The proposed solution can also be extended to any dispensing station for automatic detection and classification of blister packages, thereby offering an highly effective and efficient delivery system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502488/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197295","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Highlighted Deep Learning based Identification of Pharmaceutical Blister Packages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highlighted Deep Learning based Identification of Pharmaceutical Blister Packages","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"0638-tf-002437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12912S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488382","isNumber":"8502441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488382","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8502441","articleId":"8502488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8502515,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Pahlevan","affiliation":["University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Pahlevan","id":"37086391791"},{"name":"Roman Obermaisser","affiliation":["University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Obermaisser","id":"37298714500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7108-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7107-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7109-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"8502515","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":814},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502515","abstract":"Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is introduced as a series of Ethernet extensions to address strict temporal constraints of modern mission-critical applications. TSN offers determinism using global Time-Triggered (TT) transmission schedules. Most of existing scheduling solutions ignore interdependence of routing and scheduling problems and derive the design space of system implementations only from scheduling constraints. This strategy limits the capability of former approaches to compute a global schedule of TT communication for several real-time systems. In this paper, we present a heuristic scheduling approach based on a genetic algorithm. Our approach combines the routing and scheduling constraints and generates static global schedules using joint constraints in a single-step. The number of scheduling possibilities within the design space that is derived from joint routing and scheduling constraints increases in comparison to the approaches that only use the fixed routing. Thereby, the schedulability is improved by our solution. Our genetic-based approach also considers the distribution of real-time applications, multicast patterns and interdependencies of TT flows in the scheduling process. Due to optimized task binding and resource allocation, the experimental results show a significant enhancement of schedulability, TT transmission efficiency and resource utilization compared to the state-of-art solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502515","startPage":"337","endPage":"344","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488382/8502441/08502515.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm for Scheduling Time-Triggered Traffic in Time-Sensitive Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Routing","Job shop scheduling","Schedules","Task analysis","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","local area networks","real-time systems","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","Time-Sensitive networks","TSN offers determinism","global Time-Triggered transmission schedules","real-time systems","heuristic scheduling approach","static global schedules","time-triggered traffic","mission-critical applications","TT transmission efficiency","resource utilization","Ethernet extensions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm for Scheduling Time-Triggered Traffic in Time-Sensitive Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8502515/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197341","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm for Scheduling Time-Triggered Traffic in Time-Sensitive Networks","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"0337-tf-000264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13255S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488382","isNumber":"8502441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488382","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8502441","articleId":"8502515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8502547,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiko Takahashi","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277671400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7108-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7107-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7109-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"8502547","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Quaternions","Control systems","Biological neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete time systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","MIMO systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive-type direct controller","recurrent quaternion neural network","fully connected recurrent neural network","network parameters","quaternion numbers","real-time recurrent learning algorithm","nonlinear system","adaptive-type servo controller","discrete-time non-linear multiple-input and multiple-output plant","RQNN-based adaptive-type direct controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502547","abstract":"In this study, a fully connected recurrent neural network is applied to controlling non-linear systems, where all the network parameters and signals are expressed in quaternion numbers, and its training is conducted using a real-time recurrent learning algorithm.

Virtualization and decentralized computation is becoming a de-facto solution for factory automation. Edge Computing (EC) is a promising approach to achieve the low latencies required by many industrial systems. It employs resource rich edge servers distributed within a factory that are placed close to end devices and assist them in executing computation intensive tasks and also in coordinating with each other. This paper discusses the requirements and challenges of EC for factory automation applications. In a distributed EC infrastructure, safe and timely operation of industrial applications require load balancing and mobility support and thus a seamless service migration between the edge servers. With the recent advances in virtualization and due to its advantages, virtual machine (VM) and container technologies are pavings its way into factory. Though containers have some distinctive advantages over VMs in EC, the service live migration has comparatively high downtime. This paper proposes a novel live migration scheme called redundancy migration that reduces the downtime by a factor of 1.8 compared to the stock migration in linux containers.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502659","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488382/8502441/08502659.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Container Live Migration for Latency Critical Industrial Applications on Edge Computing","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197158","htmlLink":"/document/8502659/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Container Live Migration for Latency Critical Industrial Applications on Edge Computing","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"0083-tf-004391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076941S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488382","isNumber":"8502441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488382","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8502441","articleId":"8502659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8502663,"authors":[{"name":"Santosh Kumar Panda","affiliation":["inIT - Institute Industrial IT, OWL University of Applied Science, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Santosh Kumar","lastName":"Panda","id":"37086494206"},{"name":"Tizian Schr\u00f6der","affiliation":["Institute for Automation Technology, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Tizian","lastName":"Schr\u00f6der","id":"37086271761"},{"name":"Lukasz Wisniewski","affiliation":["inIT - Institute Industrial IT, OWL University of Applied Science, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Lukasz","lastName":"Wisniewski","id":"37543410000"},{"name":"Christian Diedrich","affiliation":["Institute for Automation Technology, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Diedrich","id":"38353190800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7108-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7107-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7109-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"8502663","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Plugs","Production systems","Industries","Semantics","Standards","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data description","factory automation","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automation industry","self-descriptive semantic device data description","data elements","Plug & Produce system architecture","OPC UA based data-space","manufacturing and production systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Industry 4.0","Asset Administration Shell","Plug & Produce","OPC UA","EDDL"]}],"abstract":"Current manufacturing and production systems are becoming more flexible and adaptable.

Once this greater goal is described, physical elements should execute steps leading towards that goal. They often supposed to take into account the dynamically changing environment, as well as the availability and the capabilities of the surrounding systems and their services. While the Arrowhead Framework already provides support for tackling interoperability, integrability, service discovery, security and other challenges, it does not intrinsically support the execution of such, runtime workflows. The current paper proposes a supporting system - namely: the Choreographer - to be utilized for service chaining, and workflow execution. Besides describing the main services provided by the Choreographer, the principles behind its operation we detail how its control sequences fit into the orchestration and event handling procedures of Arrowhead. Furthermore, we describe a novel, Petri Net based method to demonstrate how data-driven methodology can support parallelized service execution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Petri nets","Task analysis","Unified modeling language","Tools","System of systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber-physical systems","Internet of Things","Petri nets","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Choreographer","service chaining","data-driven methodology","data-driven workflow execution","service oriented IoT architectures","cyber-physical context","service discovery","runtime workflows","parallelized service execution","Petri net","Arrowhead framework"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502665","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488382/8502441/08502665.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Workflow Execution in Service Oriented IoT Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Workflow Execution in Service Oriented IoT Architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502665/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502665/","accessionNumber":"18197269","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Workflow Execution in Service Oriented IoT Architectures","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"0203-tf-003433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071308S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488382","isNumber":"8502441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488382","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8502441","articleId":"8502665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8502707,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Raj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, Bihta, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/8554318/8502707/raj-2877481-small.gif","p":["Sandeep Raj (S\u201913) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Allahabad Agricultural Institute-Deemed University, Allahabad, India, in 2009 and the M.Tech.

However, the existing ECG monitoring devices exhibit limited performance, such as they only store the ECG data, have low accuracy and their inability to perform event-by-event diagnosis at the place of data acquired. Therefore, the personalized healthcare demands an efficient method and point-of-care platform capable of providing real-time feedback to consumers as well as subjects. In this paper, a novel ECG signal analysis method using discrete cosine stockwell transform for feature extraction and artificial bee colony optimized least-square twin support vector machines as classifier is developed and prototyped using commercially available 32-bit microcontroller test platform. The prototype is evaluated under two schemes, i.e., the class and personalized schemes and validated on the benchmark MIT-BIH arrhythmia data. A higher overall accuracy of 96.14% and 86.5% respectively is reported by the prototype in the aforesaid two evaluation schemes than the existing works. The platform can be utilized as an early warning system in detecting abnormal ECG in home care environment to the state-of-art diagnosis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/8554318/08502707.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2018.2877481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2018.2877481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8554318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Personalized Point-of-Care Platform for Real-Time ECG Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Feature extraction","Real-time systems","Transforms","Biomedical monitoring","Time-frequency analysis","Medical services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial bee colony algorithm","discrete cosine transforms","electrocardiography","feature extraction","health care","least squares approximations","medical disorders","medical signal processing","microcontrollers","patient monitoring","signal classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine stockwell transform","artificial bee colony optimized least-square twin support vector machines","ECG signal analysis method","ECG monitoring devices","real-time ECG monitoring","home care environment","abnormal ECG","evaluation schemes","benchmark MIT-BIH arrhythmia data","personalized schemes","32-bit microcontroller test platform","feature extraction","real-time feedback","event-by-event diagnosis","ECG data","long-term biomedical signals","continuous monitoring","wearable devices","personalized healthcare technology","personalized point-of-care platform","BIH"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrocardiogram","artificial bee colony","cosine stockwell transform","32-bit microcontroller","support vector machines","point-of-care (PoC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Personalized Point-of-Care Platform for Real-Time ECG Monitoring","volume":"64","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8502707/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18284175","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DST INSPIRE Fellowship Scheme grant funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India","grantNumber":"IF 120841"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Personalized Point-of-Care Platform for Real-Time ECG Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tce-raj-2877481-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095164S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"8554318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8554318","articleId":"8502707","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502709,"authors":[{"name":"Zichuan Xu","affiliation":["School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/8854959/8502709/xu-2877623-small.gif","p":["Zichuan Xu (M'17) received the BSc and ME degrees from the Dalian University of Technology, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the PhD degree from the Australian National University, in 2016, all in computer science.

In particular, the deployment of cloudlets in metropolitan area networks enables network service providers to provide low-latency services to mobile users through implementing their specified virtualized network functions (VNFs) while meeting their Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we formulate a novel task offloading problem in a mobile edge-cloud network, where each offloading task requests a specified network function with a tolerable delay. We aim to maximize the number of requests admitted while minimizing the operational cost of admitted requests within a finite time horizon, through either sharing existing VNF instances or creating new VNF instances in cloudlets. We first show that the problem is NP-hard, and then devise an efficient online algorithm for the problem by reducing it to a series of minimum weight maximum matching problems. Considering dynamic changes of task offloading request patterns over time, we further develop an effective prediction mechanism for new VNF instance creations and idle VNF instance releases to further lower the operational cost of the network service provider. Also, we devise an online algorithm with a competitive ratio for a special case of the problem where the delay requirements of requests are negligible. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms are promising.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2018.2877623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

In the scheme, to exploit the subchannels difference of the users in the system, a dynamic connection network and an analog precoding matrix are first jointly designed. After that, the matched-filter or zero-forcing criterion is used to design the digital precoding matrix with the equivalent channel after analog precoding. Simulation results show that the DC-HP scheme achieves a better performance than the traditional sub-connected hybrid precoding and adaptive hybrid precoding schemes, while it also enjoys a much lower hardware implementation complexity and hardware power consumption than the full digital baseband precoding and fully connected hybrid precoding schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502711/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"18320902","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502711/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically Connected Hybrid Precoding Scheme for Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501072"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Project of the Common Key Technology of Chongqing Major Industries","grantNumber":"cstc2017zdcy-zdyfX0021"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team","grantNumber":"IRT16R72"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically Connected Hybrid Precoding Scheme for Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-jing-2877744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063895S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8570950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8570950","articleId":"8502711","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502712,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Han","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8502712/han-2877671-small.gif","p":["Shuai Han (S\u201911\u2013M\u201912\u2013SM\u201917) began his university studies in communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology in 2000.

In this paper, a power allocation algorithm is proposed for SCMA downlink systems where each tone is taken by more than one user to maximize the system's sum capacity. In SCMA systems, users are divided into different user groups. Thus, our proposed algorithm includes three-level power allocation. Since the power allocation problem is non-convex, the complexity of finding the optimal solutions is prohibitive. The Lagrange dual decomposition method is employed to efficiently solve the non-convex optimization problem.

Applying TMR to the design successfully reduces the design's neutron cross section by 80\u00d7. The effectiveness of TMR, however, is limited by the presence of single bits in the configuration memory which cause more than one TMR domain to fail simultaneously. We present three strategies to mitigate against these failures and improve the effectiveness of TMR: incremental routing, incremental placement, and striping. These techniques were tested using both fault injection and a wide spectrum neutron beam with the best technique offering a 400\u00d7 reduction to the design's sensitive neutron cross section. An analysis from the radiation test shows that no single bits caused failure and that multicell upsets were the main cause of failure for these mitigation strategies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategies for Removing Common Mode Failures From TMR Designs Deployed on SRAM FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2018.2877579","startPage":"207","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2018.2877579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8620398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/8620398/08502717.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502717","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/23/8620398/8502717-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Strategies for Removing Common Mode Failures From TMR Designs Deployed on SRAM FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"66","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8502717/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18409757","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1 265 957"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006310","fundingName":"Utah Space Grant Consortium","grantNumber":"NS-2017-7574-A and NS-2017-7574-F"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Strategies for Removing Common Mode Failures From TMR Designs Deployed on SRAM FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tns-cannon-2877579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091566S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"8620398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8620398","articleId":"8502717","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8502749,"authors":[{"name":"Shiji Mei","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502749/mei-2877219-small.gif","p":["Shiji Mei received the B.S. degree in computer science from the College of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2017.

However, with the explosive growth of communication devices, spectrum resources are becoming more and more scarce, which in turn makes it impossible to send information in time. Cognitive radio technology is an effective way to resolve spectrum allocation shortages, while the spatiotemporal uncertainty of spectrum has a great influence on the secondary user (SU)'s throughput. In this paper, we investigate the network coding scheme in cognitive radio networks under multiple primary and SU relationships, including non-collaboration, collaboration, and lease. Moreover, we propose a hybrid network coding scheme to improve the utilization efficiency of idle spectrum. In particular, the successful transmission rate and the packet loss rate can be increased and decreased through redundant coding, respectively. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve a better performance in terms of both delay and throughput than the existing mechanisms.","topic":"Collaboration for Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18495589","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502749/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Network Coding Scheme in Cognitive Radio Networks With Multiple Secondary Users","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672283"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology on Avionics Integration Laboratory and Aviation Science Foundation","grantNumber":"20175552039"},{"fundingName":"Funding of Jiangsu Innovation Program for Graduate Education","grantNumber":"KYLX15_0325"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"kfjj20171607"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Hybrid Network Coding Scheme in Cognitive Radio Networks With Multiple Secondary Users","sourcePdf":"access-mei-2877219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125023S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Collaboration for Internet of Things"],"articleId":"8502749","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502750,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Lu","affiliation":["Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robot, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502750/lu-2877422-small.gif","p":["Tao Lu received the B.S and M.S degrees from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2003 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software, Wuhan University, in 2013.

Learning-based SR algorithms infer latent HR images by the guidance of coexisted priors from training samples. Various regularization methods have been successfully applied in face hallucination to ameliorate its ill-posed nature. But most of them only consider the local manifold geometry of a single patch which results in an unstable solution for SR reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel face hallucination algorithm to embed group patches for accurate prior representation and reconstruction. First, we select multiple recurrent self-similar patches to form a group embedding matrix. Then, a graph regularization term and another multiple-manifold regularization term are used to exploit accurate representation for SR performance. Our resulting ADMM algorithm gives a stable solution in an iterative manner. Furthermore, we use a two-step searching strategy for accelerated patch matching. Experimental results on the LFW database, FEI database, and some real-world images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method when compared with state-of-the-art face hallucination results both on subjective and objective qualities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18495590","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8502750/","displayDocTitle":"Group Embedding for Face Hallucination","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502354, 61501413, 61671332 and 41501505"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2018ZYYD059, 2015CFB451, 2014CFA130, 2012FFA099, 2012FFA134 and 2013CF125"},{"fundingName":"Hubei Chenguang Talented Youth Development Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Hubei Province Technological Innovation Major Project","grantNumber":"2017AAA123"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008869","fundingName":"Wuhan Institute of Technology","grantNumber":"2017ZT07X152"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Group Embedding for Face Hallucination","sourcePdf":"access-lu-2877422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162167S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502750","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502753,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Al Disi","affiliation":["Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502753/disi-2877679-small.gif","p":["Mohammed Al Disi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Qatar University.

Compressive sensing (CS) has been explored as a method to extend the battery lifetime of medical wearable devices. However, it is usually associated with computational complexity at the decoding end, increasing the latency of the system. Meanwhile, mobile processors are becoming computationally stronger and more efficient. Heterogeneous multicore platforms (HMPs) offer a local processing solution that can alleviate the limitations of remote signal processing. This paper demonstrates the real-time performance of compressed ECG reconstruction on ARM's big.LITTLE HMP and the advantages they provide as the primary processing unit of the IoT architecture. It also investigates the efficacy of CS in minimizing power consumption of a wearable device under real-time and hardware constraints. Results show that both the orthogonal matching pursuit and subspace pursuit reconstruction algorithms can be executed on the platform in real time and yield optimum performance on a single A15 core at minimum frequency. The CS extends the battery life of wearable medical devices up to 15.4% considering ECGs suitable for wellness applications and up to 6.6% for clinical grade ECGs. Energy consumption at the gateway is largely due to an active internet connection; hence, processing the signals locally both mitigates system's latency and improves gateway's battery life. Many remote health solutions can benefit from an architecture centered around the use of HMPs, a step toward better remote health monitoring systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502753.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"69130","endPage":"69140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG Signal Reconstruction on the IoT-Gateway and Efficacy of Compressive Sensing Under Real-Time Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ECG Signal Reconstruction on the IoT-Gateway and Efficacy of Compressive Sensing Under Real-Time Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495705","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502753/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"9-114-2-055"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Library"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"ECG Signal Reconstruction on the IoT-Gateway and Efficacy of Compressive Sensing Under Real-Time Constraints","sourcePdf":"access-aldisi-2877679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123503S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502753","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502754,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Peng","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502754/peng-2877687-small.gif","p":["Shuang Peng was born in Hunan, China, in 1990.

Most of the existing studies solve the satellite onboard observation task planning problem (SOOTP) by searching algorithms. However, the limited computing resources and the changes of onboard condition present a new challenge for these methods. In this paper, we develop a sequential decision-making model and propose a deep learning-based planning method to solve the SOOTP. Instead of generating a short-term or long-term plan in advance, the sequential decisionmaking model enables the satellite to decide the observation task to execute in real-time. In the deep learning-based planning method, a long short-term memory-based encoding network is designed to extract the features and a classification network is used to make such a decision. In the experiment, we compared our method with the gated recurrent unit network and other three searching algorithms based on five scenarios. The experimental results show that our method can solve problems with 90.3%-93.7% accuracy, 2.19%-3.95% profit gap, and 0.004-0.006 s response time per task, which confirms its feasibility.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877687","startPage":"65118","endPage":"65129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502754.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Onboard Observation Task Planning for an Autonomous Earth Observation Satellite Using Long Short-Term Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502754/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Onboard Observation Task Planning for an Autonomous Earth Observation Satellite Using Long Short-Term Memory","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8502754/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18495592","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174159 and 61806211"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Onboard Observation Task Planning for an Autonomous Earth Observation Satellite Using Long Short-Term Memory","sourcePdf":"access-peng-2877687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078361S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502754","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502760,"authors":[{"name":"Tariq Qayyum","affiliation":["Department of Computing, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502760/qayyu-2877696-small.gif","p":["Tariq Qayyum received the B.S.C.S. degree from the Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan.

(a) presents the traditional design of smart devices where a node streams a raw signal to an IoT gateway or to a cloud endpoint, which is in charge of the feature extraction and the anomaly detection operations. In our deployment where the IoT gateway processes the audio signal, this approach introduces privacy-related issues and a bandwidth bottleneck due to the limitations introduced by the Bluetooth transceiver. (b) depicts the software implemented in our SAS node. Part of the computation, the MEL coefficient extraction (Feature Extraction), has been moved from the gateway to the smart device. This reduces the bandwidth required to stream data to the gateways and it introduces a good level of privacy by design. This approach follows the Edge Computing paradigm that moves computations closer to the data sources.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"36KB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/8274985/8502761/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2877523.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/8274985/8502761/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2877523.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Logic gates","Intelligent sensors","Synthetic aperture sonar","Internet of Things","Software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","digital signal processing","edge computing","embedded devices","Internet of Things","IoT gateway","machine learning","novelty detection","open-source platforms","outlier detection"]}],"abstract":"Everyday objects are becoming smart enough to directly connect to other nearby and remote objects and systems. These objects increasingly interact with machine learning applications that perform feature extraction and model inference in the cloud. However, this approach poses several challenges due to latency, privacy, and dependency on network connectivity between data producers and consumers. To alleviate these limitations, computation should be moved as much as possible towards the IoT edge, that is on gateways, if not directly on data producers. In this paper, we propose a design framework for smart audio sensors able to record and pre-process raw audio streams, before wirelessly transmitting the computed audio features to a modular IoT gateway. In this paper, an anomaly detection algorithm executed as a micro-service is capable of analyzing the received features, hence detecting audio anomalies in real-time. First, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we deployed a real smart environment showcase. More in detail, we adopted two different anomaly detection algorithms, namely \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Elliptic Envelope</i>\n and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Isolation Forest</i>\n, that were purposely trained and deployed on an affordable IoT gateway to detect anomalous sound events happening in an office environment. Then, we numerically compared both the deployments, in terms of end-to-end latency and gateway CPU load, also deriving some ideal capacity bounds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Audio Sensors in the Internet of Things Edge for Anomaly Detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877523","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502761.pdf","startPage":"67594","endPage":"67610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502761","topic":"Towards Service-Centric Internet of Things (IoT): From Modeling to Practice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Smart Audio Sensors in the Internet of Things Edge for Anomaly Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8502761/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","grantNumber":"688088"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Smart Audio Sensors in the Internet of Things Edge for Anomaly Detection","sourcePdf":"access-perera-2877523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115417S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Towards Service-Centric Internet of Things (IoT): From Modeling to Practice"],"articleId":"8502761","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8502762,"authors":[{"name":"Chaofeng Li","affiliation":["Institute of Logistics Science and Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502762/li-2877714-small.gif","p":["Chaofeng Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematical geology and the Ph.D. degree in remote sensing image processing from the Chinese University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 1995, 1998, and 2001, respectively.

However, the metrics of image quality assessment for multiply distorted images are very limited. In this paper, we propose a new multiscale learning quality-aware features blind image quality assessment algorithm for multiply distorted images by using both local phase and local amplitude. In the new model, a distorted image is decomposed into three scales by Gabor transform, and its phase congruency image (PCI), phase congruency covariance maximum image (PCCmax), and phase congruency covariance minimum image (PCCmin) are produced. Then, we calculate contrast sensitivity function and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix features from distorted image and its PCI, PCCmax, and PCCmin, and mean value of intensity of PCI, PCCmax, PCCmin, and overlapping blocked local amplitude of distorted image. At last, SVR is used to build the approximating function between these features and subjective mean opinion scores. Both local phase and local amplitude features are extracted at multi-scale images, which supply more flexibility than the previous single-scale methods in incorporating the variations of viewing scene. Comparative experiments between our proposed metric and the state-of-the-art full-reference and no-reference metrics are conducted on two newly released multiply distorted image databases (LIVEMD and MDID2013) that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877714","startPage":"64577","endPage":"64586","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502762.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Scale Learning Local Phase and Amplitude Blind Image Quality Assessment for Multiply Distorted Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Scale Learning Local Phase and Amplitude Blind Image Quality Assessment for Multiply Distorted Images","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8502762/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18495598","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502762/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771223"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Multi-Scale Learning Local Phase and Amplitude Blind Image Quality Assessment for Multiply Distorted Images","sourcePdf":"access-li-2877714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097967S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502762","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8502767,"authors":[{"name":"Erdal Ar\u0131kan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502767/arika-2877720-small.gif","p":["Erdal Ar\u0131kan (S\u201984\u2013M\u201979\u2013SM\u201994\u2013F\u201911) was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1958.

Furthermore, this performance improvement is achieved using a relatively short cyclic redundancy check as the outer code and a practically implementable successive cancellation list decoder for decoding the overall code. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of such schemes by employing a random-coding method on the selection of the outer code and assuming that the channel is memoryless. It is shown that the probability of error for the concatenated coding scheme decreases exponentially in the code block length at any fixed rate below the symmetric capacity. Applications of this result include the design of polar codes for communication systems that require high reliability at small to moderate code lengths, such as control channels in wireless systems and machine-type communications for industrial automation.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

In more realistic scenarios, the available relays are untrusted, which try to decode the confidential signals during their main relaying function. Thus, these untrusted relays are regarded as potential eavesdroppers, and the confidential signals are vulnerable. A positive secrecy rate can be achieved at the physical layer without any cryptography, in particular, the mutual interference achieved from two-way relaying network can be used to secure the confidential signals against eavesdroppers attack. In this paper, the relay selection of two-way untrusted relays network is presented, and a directed beamforming is aligned to zero force the transmission at all other non-selected relays. Particularly, we propose a selection scheme based on max-min criterion, which requires an exhaustive search. Then, the lower bound (LB) of the secrecy rate is introduced to minimize the complexity of the selection criterion. The closed forms of the secure outage probability (SOP) for the max-min LB scheme is formulated and compared with other schemes. The simulations results validate the proposed analytical forms, and the performance of max-min LB scheme appears to be quite close to that of the max-min scheme with limited complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system reliability","Probability","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Jamming","Wireless sensor networks","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","array signal processing","minimax techniques","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["main relaying function","positive secrecy rate","secure outage probability","max-min LB scheme","secure relay selection","transmission coverage area","two way amplify-and-forward untrusted relaying networks","relay assisted communication","mutual interference","directed beamforming","SOP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay selection","secure outage probabilities","wireless sensor network","two way network","untrusted relaying networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2877718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8577058/08502793.pdf","startPage":"11979","endPage":"11987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2877718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Relay Selection for Two Way Amplify-and-Forward Untrusted Relaying Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure Relay Selection for Two Way Amplify-and-Forward Untrusted Relaying Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502793/","volume":"67","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502793/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18344998","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102018JGC006"},{"fundingName":"Aeronautical Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2017ZC53029"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501376 and 61871327"},{"fundingName":"Science Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170306155652174"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Relay Selection for Two Way Amplify-and-Forward Untrusted Relaying Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-yao-2877718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087249S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8502793","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":8502795,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaonan Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8502795/liu-2877504-small.gif","p":["Xiaonan Liu received the B.E. degree from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the M.E. degree at the School of Information and Communication Engineering.","His current research interests include UAV communications, interference alignment, cache-aided networks, NOMA, and deep learning."]},"firstName":"Xiaonan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085873991"},{"name":"Zan Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8502795/li-2877504-small.gif","p":["Zan Li (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.S. degree in communications engineering and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information systems from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1998, 2000, and 2004, respectively.","She is currently a Professor with the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited as flying base stations to provide emergency coverage for IoT, due to its mobility and flexibility. In this paper, we propose multiantenna transceiver design and multihop device-to-device (D2D) communication to guarantee the reliable transmission and extend the UAV coverage for IoT in disasters. First, multihop D2D links are established to extend the coverage of UAV emergency networks due to the constrained transmit power of the UAV. In particular, a shortest-path-routing algorithm is proposed to establish the D2D links rapidly with minimum nodes. The closed-form solutions for the number of hops and the outage probability are derived for the uplink and downlink. Second, the transceiver designs for the UAV uplink and downlink are studied to optimize the performance of UAV transmission. Due to the nonconvexity of the problem, they are first transformed into convex ones and then, low-complexity algorithms are proposed to solve them efficiently. Simulation results show the performance improvement in the throughput and outage probability by the proposed schemes for UAV wireless coverage of IoT in disasters.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2877504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8709863/08502795.pdf","startPage":"1803","endPage":"1815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8709863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2877504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transceiver Design and Multihop D2D for UAV IoT Coverage in Disasters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver Design and Multihop D2D for UAV IoT Coverage in Disasters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502795/","publicationDate":"April 2019","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18654041","htmlLink":"/document/8502795/","volume":"6","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871065"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks","grantNumber":"ISN19-02"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT17JC43"},{"fundingName":"Xinghai Scholars Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transceiver Design and Multihop D2D for UAV IoT Coverage in Disasters","sourcePdf":"jiot-zhao-2877504-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125076S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8502795","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502796,"authors":[{"name":"Songnian Fu","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Next Generation Internet Access System, School of Optics and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Songnian Fu received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Xiamen\n University, Xiamen, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

The inserted delay elements are temporally invariant however they are spatially variant. In this brief, we introduce a basic analysis of the shortcoming of flattening the power in D3C and investigate it by utilizing counterexample. In the proposed approach, we have utilized a non-true temporally random power as a shortcoming of IOA countermeasure to perform a successful DPA attack. The attack method is a chosen-plaintext attack. In this attack, the input data pattern is set to be constant to fix the delay of the D3C countermeasure. Hence, the countermeasure is bypassed and consequently the DPA attack on the S-box, which is introduced (the S-box) by IOA, is successful. By this attack, all the bits of the S-box, which was claimed as attack-proof by the D3C method, are recovered bitwise. In the first place, the S-box is modeled in an SPICE simulator to perform the proposed idea. Then, the proposed attack on IOA countermeasure is proved by HDL experimental results. The experiment is carried out via a Sakura-GW evaluation board and a Xilinx FPGA Spartan-6LX75 test-bed.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2877525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2877525","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8781992/08502797.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8781992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DPA Attack on IOA Data-Dependent Delay Countermeasure Based on an Inherent Tempo-Spatial Data Dependency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"A DPA Attack on IOA Data-Dependent Delay Countermeasure Based on an Inherent Tempo-Spatial Data Dependency","volume":"66","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18881567","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502797/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DPA Attack on IOA Data-Dependent Delay Countermeasure Based on an Inherent Tempo-Spatial Data Dependency","sourcePdf":"tcsii-doostari-2877525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074194S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8781992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","xplore-issue":"8781992","articleId":"8502797","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502806,"authors":[{"name":"Changhe Yu","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological R&D Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502806/yu-2877686-small.gif","p":["Changhe Yu received the B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

When data owner Alice is going to share her encrypted data with data consumer Bob, Alice generates a re-encryption key and sends it to the cloud server (proxy); by using it, the proxy can transform Alice's ciphertexts into Bob's without learning anything about the underlying plaintexts. Despite that existing PRE schemes can prevent the proxy from recovering Alice's secret key by collusion attacks with Bob, due to the inherent functionality of PRE, it is inevitable that the proxy and Bob together are capable to gain and distribute Alices decryption capabilities. Even worse, the malicious proxy can deny that it has leaked the decryption capabilities and has very little risk of getting caught. To tackle this problem, we introduce the concept of Accountable Proxy Re-Encryption (APRE), whereby if the proxy is accused to abuse the re-encryption key for distributing Alice's decryption capability, a judge algorithm can decide whether it is innocent or not. We then present a non-interactive APRE scheme and prove its CPA security and accountability under DBDH assumption in the standard model. Finally, we show how to extend it to a CCA secure one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","volume":"18","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"20342672","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2021","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/8502807/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accountable Proxy Re-Encryption for Secure Data Sharing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61802021, U1536205, 61572485 and 61802270"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accountable Proxy Re-Encryption for Secure Data Sharing","sourcePdf":"tdsc-guo-2877601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.43443S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"9316344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9316344","articleId":"8502807","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502812,"authors":[{"name":"Wael Ayoub","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering\u2014CRSI, Lebanese University (Hadath Campus), Hadath, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8727625/8502812/ayoub-2877382-small.gif","p":["Wael Ayoub received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in computer and communication engineering from the Lebanese International University, Beirut, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation, etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2018.2877382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8727625/08502812.pdf","startPage":"1561","endPage":"1581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8727625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2018.2877382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internet of Mobile Things: Overview of LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT in LPWANs Standards and Supported Mobility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2019","displayDocTitle":"Internet of Mobile Things: Overview of LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT in LPWANs Standards and Supported Mobility","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502812/","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2019","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18726268","htmlLink":"/document/8502812/","volume":"21","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internet of Mobile Things: Overview of LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT in LPWANs Standards and Supported Mobility","sourcePdf":"comst-ayoub-2877382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147515S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8727625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"8727625","articleId":"8502812","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502822,"authors":[{"name":"Puning Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Puning","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-1199-1327","id":"37086524725"},{"name":"Xuyuan Kang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xuyuan","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086528366"},{"name":"Dapeng Wu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Dapeng","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0003-2105-9418","id":"37086713346"},{"name":"Ruyan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Ruyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086811984"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8502822","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502822","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Probability distribution","Artificial neural networks","Internet of Things","Predictive models","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep belief network","physical entity","candidate entities","searching match entities","IoT search system","high-accuracy entity state prediction method","deep learning theory","prediction accuracy","time-varying characteristic","shallow learning","contrastive divergence algorithm","HESPM","communication overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IoT","IoT search","entity state prediction","DBN"]}],"abstract":"The state of physical entity in the Internet of Things (IoT) has an obvious time-varying characteristic.

Thus, a high-accuracy entity state prediction method (HESPM) based on deep learning theory is proposed. The model of HESPM is built by utilizing the deep belief network.

However, the brain's dynamical functional states recognition at fast time-scales in task fMRI data have been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a novel 5-layer deep sparse recurrent neural network (DSRNN) model to accurately recognize the brain states across the whole scan session. Specifically, the DSRNN model includes an input layer, one fully-connected layer, two recurrent layers, and a softmax output layer. The proposed framework has been tested on seven task fMRI data sets of Human Connectome Project. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed DSRNN model can accurately identify the brain's state in different task fMRI data sets and significantly outperforms other auto-correlation methods or non-temporal approaches in the dynamic brain state recognition accuracy. In general, the proposed DSRNN offers a new methodology for basic neuroscience and clinical research.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2018.2877576","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1068","publicationTitle":"IEEE

the same nodes share different links in each layer (referred as multi-layer networks). Here, the epidemic spreading process on multi-layer networks is investigated, where an infectious yet indistinguishable (as symptoms are not presented) state is considered (i.e., an exposed state). Motived by the fact that subjects are inclined to take preventive measure: cutting potential connection with infection sources during undesirable infections, we consider the epidemic spreading process with such an adaptive framework: a susceptible/exposed individual will disconnect with infected neighbors probabilistically. Once a connection is removed, one new connection will be constructed with uninfected one. The epidemic spreading process will be greatly affected with the adoption of adaptive strategy. Furthermore, we also study the effect of varying community number via incorporating new individuals, and find the consideration of community movement plays an important role in the epidemic re-occurrence. Various benchmarks are analyzed via using the proposed model as well to investigating corresponding spreading behaviors.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2877406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2877406","startPage":"1252","endPage":"1256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8746742/08502826.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8746742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Epidemic Spreading Process in Adaptive Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Epidemic Spreading Process in Adaptive Networks","volume":"66","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2019","accessionNumber":"18777146","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502826/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601371"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102018zy034"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2018JQ6075"},{"fundingName":"Aviation Science Fund of China","grantNumber":"2016ZD53035"},{"fundingName":"Industry-Academy-Research Cooperation Project of AVIC","grantNumber":"cxy2013XGD14"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Epidemic Spreading Process in Adaptive Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wang-2877406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094663S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8746742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8746742","articleId":"8502826","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502827,"authors":[{"name":"Dingde Jiang","affiliation":["School of Astronautics and Aeronautic, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488902/9025091/8502827/jiang-2877597-small.gif","p":["Dingde Jiang (S'08-M'09) received the PhD degree in communication and information systems from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2009.

The direct measurement of a network's traffic matrix consumes large amounts of network resources and is thus impractical in most cases. How to accurately construct traffic matrix remains a great challenge. This paper studies end-to-end network traffic reconstruction in large-scale networks. Applying compressive sensing theory, we propose a novel reconstruction method for end-to-end traffic flows. First, the direct measurement of partial Origin-Destination (OD) flows is determined by random measurement matrix, providing partial measurements. Then, we use the K-SVD approach to obtain a sparse matrix. Combined with compressive sensing, this partially known OD flow matrix can be used to recover the entire end-to-end network traffic matrix. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reconstruct end-to-end network traffic with a high degree of accuracy. Moreover, in comparison with previous methods, our approach exhibits a significant performance improvement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and

SparseCast achieves improved end-to-end reconstruction quality while reducing the bandwidth requirement by exploiting frequency-domain sparsity through compressed sensing. The proposed algorithm produces a linear relationship between the channel signal-to-noise ratio and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) without requiring the channel state knowledge at the transmitter. This is particularly attractive when transmitting to multiple receivers or over unknown time-varying channels, as the receiver PSNR depends on the experienced channel quality and is not bottlenecked by the worst channel. SparseCast is benchmarked against two alternative algorithms: SoftCast and block CS-smooth projected Landweber (BCS-SPL). Our findings show that the proposed algorithm outperforms SoftCast by approximately 3.5 dB and BCS-SPL by 15.2 dB.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2877316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8570950/08502829.pdf","startPage":"2451","endPage":"2454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8570950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2877316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SparseCast: Hybrid Digital-Analog Wireless Image Transmission Exploiting Frequency-Domain Sparsity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"SparseCast: Hybrid Digital-Analog Wireless Image Transmission Exploiting Frequency-Domain Sparsity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502829/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18320915","htmlLink":"/document/8502829/","volume":"22","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) through starting Grant BEACON","grantNumber":"677854"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SparseCast: Hybrid Digital-Analog Wireless Image Transmission Exploiting Frequency-Domain Sparsity","sourcePdf":"lcomm-tung-2877316-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057002S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8570950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8570950","articleId":"8502829","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502831,"authors":[{"name":"Changqing Zhang","affiliation":["College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/8922815/8502831/zhang-2877660-small.gif","p":["Changqing Zhang received the BS and MS degrees from the College of Computer, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer science from Tianjin University, China, in 2016.

Here, we propose a novel subspace clustering model for multi-view data using a latent representation termed Latent Multi-View Subspace Clustering (LMSC). Unlike most existing single-view subspace clustering methods, which directly reconstruct data points using original features, our method explores underlying complementary information from multiple views and simultaneously seeks the underlying latent representation. Using the complementarity of multiple views, the latent representation depicts data more comprehensively than each individual view, accordingly making subspace representation more accurate and robust. We proposed two LMSC formulations: linear LMSC (lLMSC), based on linear correlations between latent representation and each view, and generalized LMSC (gLMSC), based on neural networks to handle general relationships. The proposed method can be efficiently optimized under the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier with Alternating Direction Minimization (ALM-ADM) framework. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502831/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2020","volume":"42","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19194175","pubMedId":"30369436","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2019","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8502831/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Latent Multi-View Subspace Clustering","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61602337, 61732011, 61432011, U1435212, U1636214, 61733007 and 61602345"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"CA206100 and MH100217"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FL-170100117 and DP-180103424"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Latent Multi-View Subspace Clustering","sourcePdf":"tpami-zhang-2877660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.318745S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8922815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"8922815","articleId":"8502831","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502833,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8502833/wang-2877510-small.gif","p":["Yu Wang (S\u201913\u2013M\u201917) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in instrument and meter engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA, in 2015.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing.

In this paper, we propose a novel least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and long short term memory (LSTM) integrated forecasting model for precise short-term prediction of solar intensity based on meteorological data. It is a fusion of a basic time series model, data clustering, a statistical model, and machine learning. The proposed scheme first clusters data using k -means++. For each cluster, a distinctive forecasting model is then constructed by applying LSTM, which learns the nonlinear relationships and LASSO, which captures the linear relationship within the data. Simulation results with open-source datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model in short-term forecasting of solar intensity.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6488907/8709863/8502833-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","dateOfInsertion":"09 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18653915","htmlLink":"/document/8502833/","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"LASSO and LSTM Integrated Temporal Model for Short-Term Solar Intensity Forecasting","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51607087"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"XCA17003-06"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"DMS-1736470"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007579","fundingName":"Auburn University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"LASSO and LSTM Integrated Temporal Model for Short-Term Solar Intensity Forecasting","sourcePdf":"jiot-mao-2877510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134672S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8502833","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502836,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-8860-7023","id":"37085533252"},{"name":"Gang Liu","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-6428-7675","id":"37086521057"},{"name":"Hui Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37405367800"},{"name":"Qinghui Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qinghui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085702919"},{"name":"Jing He","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0002-4819-0136","id":"37833833500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"8502836","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"Sampling frequency offset (SFO) between digital-to-analog converters and analog-to-digital converters will seriously degrade the receiver performance of the asynchronous direct-detection optical OFDM (DDO-OFDM), due to the SFO-induced inter-symbol interference, inter-channel interference, and phase rotation. In this letter, a simple and overhead-free SFO compensation scheme enabled by inter-symbol differential detection (ISDD) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated in a short-reach and low-cost directly modulated laser-based DDO-OFDM system with an optimal fast Fourier transform size. The experimental results exhibit that the SFO up to \u00b1200 ppm can be compensated with acceptable error vector magnitude (EVM) penalties after 20-km standard single-mode fiber transmission. Moreover, the EVM performance can be further enhanced by using a decision-aided residual phase compensation method after ISDD when SFO is large.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/8547155/08502836.pdf","startPage":"2095","endPage":"2098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2018.2877723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2018.2877723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8547155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-Symbol Differential Detection-Enabled Sampling Frequency Offset Compensation for DDO-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical attenuators","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","compensation","fast Fourier transforms","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","optical modulation","optical signal detection","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital-to-analog converters","receiver performance degradation","phase rotation","ISDD","low-cost directly modulated laser-based DDO-OFDM system","optimal fast Fourier transform size","error vector magnitude","standard single-mode fiber transmission","EVM performance","inter-symbol differential detection-enabled sampling frequency offset compensation","decision-aided residual phase compensation method","overhead-free SFO compensation scheme","inter-channel interference","SFO-induced inter-symbol interference","asynchronous direct-detection optical OFDM","analog-to-digital converters","distance 20 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","sampling frequency offset (SFO)","inter-symbol differential encoding/detection","direct-detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Inter-Symbol Differential Detection-Enabled Sampling Frequency Offset Compensation for DDO-OFDM","volume":"30","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/8502836/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"18286211","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of\u00a0Hunan Province","grantNumber":"2017JJ3212 and 2016JJ6097"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61805079 and 61701180"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-Symbol Differential Detection-Enabled Sampling Frequency Offset Compensation for DDO-OFDM","sourcePdf":"lpt-chen-2877723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054713S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"8547155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8547155","articleId":"8502836","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502838,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Zhao","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8577058/8502838/zhao-2877645-small.gif","p":["Nan Zhao (S\u201908\u2013M\u201911\u2013SM\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2011.

However, with the increasing number of devices, it cannot meet the requirements from all users. Thus, we propose a caching device-to-device (D2D) scheme for small-cell networks, in which caching placement and D2D establishment are combined. In this scheme, a limited cache is equipped at each user, and the popular files can be prefetched at the local cache during off-peak period. Thus, dense D2D connections can be established during peak time aided by these cached users, which will reduce the backhaul pressure significantly. To do this, first, an optimal caching scheme is formulated according to the popularity to maximize the total offloading probability of the D2D system. Thus, most edge users can obtain their required video files from the caches at users nearby, instead from the small-cell base station. Then, the sum rate of D2D links is analyzed in different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Furthermore, to maximize the throughput of D2D links with low complexity, three D2D-link scheduling schemes are proposed with the help of bipartite graph theory and Kuhn-Munkres algorithm for low, high, and medium SNRs, respectively. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2877645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8577058/08502838.pdf","startPage":"12326","endPage":"12338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2877645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Caching D2D Connections in Small-Cell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Caching D2D Connections in Small-Cell Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502838/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18344994","htmlLink":"/document/8502838/","volume":"67","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871065 and 61771089"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT17JC43"},{"fundingName":"Xinghai Scholars Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching D2D Connections in Small-Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhao-2877645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119427S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8502838","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502839,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ghahremani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Twente, NH Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghahremani","orcid":"0000-0002-6741-3753","id":"37855888600"},{"name":"Anne-Johan Annema","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Twente, NH Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Anne-Johan","lastName":"Annema","orcid":"0000-0001-8164-3064","id":"37272913300"},{"name":"Bram Nauta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Twente, NH Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bram","lastName":"Nauta","orcid":"0000-0001-6790-5873","id":"37274378900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8502839","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":547},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Load modeling","Power generation","Switches","Power combiners","Impedance","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","power combiners","quadrature amplitude modulation","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OEPAs","inverse cosine signal component separator","off-chip transmission-line-based combiner","isolating power combiners","highly efficient linear outphasing Class-E PA","theory-based DPD","frequency 1.8 GHz","frequency 6.25 MHz","bit rate 30.0 Mbit/s","noise figure 7.0 dB","efficiency 41.8 percent","efficiency 33.6 percent","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class E","outphasing power amplifier","load insensitive","load-pull contours","linearity","AM/AM","AM/PM"]}],"abstract":"Outphasing Class-E power amplifiers (OEPAs) using isolating power combiners and an inverse cosine signal component separator are inherently linear but suffer from low efficiency at power back-off.

However, the uncertain and volatile wind speed makes the utilization of wind power a challenging task. Hence, it is essential to design an accurate forecast method to deal with the uncertainty caused by wind speed. This paper proposes a multiobjective interval prediction method based on wavelet neural network (WNN) for short-term wind speed forecast. This method can generate a set of Pareto optimal solutions which represents a set of prediction models that can directly construct the prediction intervals. An advanced multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, preference inspired co-evolutionary algorithm using goal vectors, is investigated to train the WNN model. Two case studies are carried out with real wind speed data of Victoria and Edmonton in Canada to justify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The numerical results also show the superiority of the proposed forecast approach compared with some benchmark methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877735","startPage":"63352","endPage":"63365","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502842.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Neural Network Based Multiobjective Interval Prediction for Short-Term Wind Speed","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Wind forecasting","Wind speed","Computational modeling","Atmospheric modeling","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","load forecasting","neural nets","Pareto optimisation","power engineering computing","wavelet transforms","wind power","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet neural network","wind power","existing power system","uncertain wind speed","volatile wind speed","accurate forecast method","multiobjective interval prediction method","short-term wind speed","prediction models","prediction intervals","advanced multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","preference inspired co-evolutionary algorithm","wind speed data","benchmark methods","pollution-free renewable energy","clean renewable energy","Pareto optimal solutions","WNN model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interval prediction","multiobjective optimization","neural network","wind speed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502842/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Neural Network Based Multiobjective Interval Prediction for Short-Term Wind Speed","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8502842/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18495611","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wavelet Neural Network Based Multiobjective Interval Prediction for Short-Term Wind Speed","sourcePdf":"access-shi-2877735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109593S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502842","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":8502844,"authors":[{"name":"Simiao Yu","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502844/yu-2877638-small.gif","p":["Simiao Yu was born in Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang, China, in 1988.

In this paper, a space manipulator docking HIL system is designed, the space manipulator docking dynamics model is established and the motion process of space docking is simulated by a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel robot. Delays exist in the force sensor and the parallel robot of the HIL system and are unavoidable; which not only affect the accuracy of the HIL system simulation, but also lead to instability of the system, resulting in docking failure and damage to the docking mechanism (DM). In view of the contact characteristics of DM, a force and moment compensation method based on three DOF stiffness-damping identification is proposed in this paper. Considering the time-varying characteristics of multi-DOF contact parameters, on-line identification is applied to identify the stiffness and damping in three perpendicular directions. Then a six DOF compensation model is established to compensate the deviation of contact force and moment caused by the delays, so as to improve the stability and reproduction accuracy of the system. Compared with the existing single DOF compensation researches, the considering of contact parameters and the model of compensation in this paper are all applicable to multi-DOF system. Moreover, the compensation model doesn't need the model and delay characteristics of the parallel robot, so it is a model-free compensation. The effectiveness of the proposed compensation method is verified by simulation and experiment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502844/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495612","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Force and Moment Compensation Method Based on Three Degree-of-Freedom Stiffness-Damping Identification for Manipulator Docking Hardware-In-The-Loop Simulation System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51475116 and 51505100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Force and Moment Compensation Method Based on Three Degree-of-Freedom Stiffness-Damping Identification for Manipulator Docking Hardware-In-The-Loop Simulation System","sourcePdf":"access-yang-2877638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080075S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502844","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8502846,"authors":[{"name":"Issa Mohamed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Issa","lastName":"Mohamed","orcid":"0000-0002-9456-3466","id":"37085342961"},{"name":"Abdelrazik Sebak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdelrazik","lastName":"Sebak","orcid":"0000-0003-1057-6735","id":"37281307000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8502846","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2676},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502846","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Waveguide transitions","Rectangular waveguides","Substrate integrated waveguides","Loss measurement","Broadband communication","Insertion loss","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printed circuits","rectangular waveguides","substrate integrated waveguides","waveguide transitions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["substrate-integrated waveguide-to-air-filled rectangular waveguide","air-filled standard rectangular waveguide","aperture coupled patch","single layer substrate","single transition","single-layer right-angle broadband transition","single-layer air-filled standard rectangular waveguide","V-band","inductive posts","back-to-back transition","printed circuit board technology","insertion loss","HFSS simulation","millimeter-wave circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rectangular waveguide (RWG) transition","substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW)","V-band","WR-15 waveguide"]}],"abstract":"A single-layer right-angle broadband transition between the substrate-integrated waveguide and air-filled standard rectangular waveguide is proposed and demonstrated at the V-band.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has proved to be an efficient method to cater to the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G. This paper employs NOMA in an heterogeneous cellular network consisting of a macro base station (MBS) tier underlaid with femto base station (FBS) tier and device-to-device (D2D) tier, where NOMA is employed in FBS and D2D tier only. The congestion at the MBS tier is relieved by offloading macro users (MU) to the FBS tier. The offloaded MU are further supported by the D2D tier when the FBS tier fails to find a corresponding pairing user for the incoming offloaded MU. Since, absence of pairing user means outage for offloaded MU, D2D cooperation is employed, which decreases the rate outage probability by 86.87% for the MU offloaded as cell edge user (CEU) in comparison to no cooperation. Also, a three times increase in ergodic rate and four times increase in sum ergodic rate for MU offloaded as CEU is achieved using cooperation from D2D tier. Verification of the results is done using Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cooperation Scheme for User Fairness and Performance Enhancement in NOMA-HCN","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2877619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8577058/08502848.pdf","startPage":"11965","endPage":"11978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2877619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperation Scheme for User Fairness and Performance Enhancement in NOMA-HCN","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8502848/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18344986","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MeitY, DST UKIERI","grantNumber":"DST/INT/UK/P-129/2016 and DST UKIERI-2016-17-0060"},{"fundingName":"Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Indore, India"},{"fundingName":"University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K."},{"fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/P009549/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperation Scheme for User Fairness and Performance Enhancement in NOMA-HCN","sourcePdf":"tvt-swami-2877619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094658S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8502848","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8502853,"authors":[{"name":"Song Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/9290149/8502853/wang-2877612-small.gif","p":["Song Wang received the BEng degree from Sichuan University, China, in 2011, the MSc degree in computer science from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2014.

Traditional defect prediction features often fail to capture the semantic differences between different programs. This degrades the performance of the prediction models built on these traditional features. Thus, the capability to capture the semantics in programs is required to build accurate prediction models. To bridge the gap between semantics and defect prediction features, we propose leveraging a powerful representation-learning algorithm, deep learning, to learn the semantic representations of programs automatically from source code files and code changes. Specifically, we leverage a deep belief network (DBN) to automatically learn semantic features using token vectors extracted from the programs' abstract syntax trees (AST) (for file-level defect prediction models) and source code changes (for change-level defect prediction models). We examine the effectiveness of our approach on two file-level defect prediction tasks (i.e., file-level within-project defect prediction and file-level cross-project defect prediction) and two change-level defect prediction tasks (i.e., change-level within-project defect prediction and change-level cross-project defect prediction). Our experimental results indicate that the DBN-based semantic features can significantly improve the examined defect prediction tasks. Specifically, the improvements of semantic features against existing traditional features (in F1) range from 2.1 to 41.9 percentage points for file-level within-project defect prediction, from 1.5 to 13.4 percentage points for file-level cross-project defect prediction, from 1.0 to 8.6 percentage points for change-level within-project defect prediction, and from 0.6 to 9.9 percentage points for change-level cross-project defect prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2020","volume":"46","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"20240805","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2020","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8502853/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Semantic Feature Learning for Software Defect Prediction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2018R1C1B6001919"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Semantic Feature Learning for Software Defect Prediction","sourcePdf":"tse-wang-2877612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.243513S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"9290149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"9290149","articleId":"8502853","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502858,"authors":[{"name":"Chunchi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8738925/8502858/liu-2877634-small.gif","p":["Chunchi Liu received the bachelor\u2019s degree (with distinction) in science from Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.

The management system toward IoT-based E-commerce demands autonomy, lightweight, and legitimacy. As blockchain is an innovative technology that is competent in governing the decentralized network, we adopt it to design the autonomous transaction management system on IoT E-commerce. However, current blockchain solutions, most namely cryptocurrencies, have fatal drawbacks of nonsupervisability and huge computational overhead, and hence cannot be directly applied on IoT-based E-commerce. In this paper, we propose NormaChain, a blockchain-based normalized autonomous transaction settlement system for IoT-based E-commerce. By designing a special three-layer sharding blockchain network, we can significantly increase transaction efficiency and system scalability. Additionally, by designing an innovative decentralized public key searchable encryption scheme (decentralized public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) scheme), we can uncover illegal and criminal transactions and achieve crime traceability. Our new decentralized PEKS scheme cryptographically eliminates the dependence of a trusted central authority in the original PEKS scheme and instead expands it to a fully decentralized governance, which distributes the supervision power equally among all parties. More importantly, by proving NormaChain is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks and against the stealing of the secret key, we show that NormaChain prevents a legitimate user's privacy from being violated by banks, supervisors or malicious adversaries. Finally, we deliver the NormaChain system with design details and full implementations. Experiments show that the average transaction-per-second on IoT devices is around 113, and the supervision accuracy is 100% when proper target illegal keywords are provided.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2877634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8738925/08502858.pdf","startPage":"4680","endPage":"4693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2877634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NormaChain: A Blockchain-Based Normalized Autonomous Transaction Settlement System for IoT-Based E-Commerce","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6488907/8738925/8502858-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"NormaChain: A Blockchain-Based Normalized Autonomous Transaction Settlement System for IoT-Based E-Commerce","volume":"6","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","accessionNumber":"18758097","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502858/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502858/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"IIS-1741279 and CNS-1704397"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472044 and 61772080"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"NormaChain: A Blockchain-Based Normalized Autonomous Transaction Settlement System for IoT-Based E-Commerce","sourcePdf":"jiot-hu-2877634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094513S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8738925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8738925","articleId":"8502858","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502860,"authors":[{"name":"Wan-Lin Hu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221037/8910331/8502860/hu-2874188-small.gif","p":["Wan-Lin Hu received the B.S. degree in bio-industrial mechatronics engineering and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

The proposed model describes human trust level as a function of experience, cumulative trust, and expectation bias. We estimated the model parameters using human subject data collected from two experiments. Experiment 1 was designed to excite human trust dynamics using multiple transitions in trust level. Five hundred and eighty-one individuals participated in this experiment. Experiment 2 was an augmentation of Experiment 1 designed to study and incorporate the effects of misses and false alarms in the general model. Three hundred and thirty-three individuals participated in Experiment 2. Beyond considering the dynamics of human trust in automation, this model also characterizes the effects of demographic factors on human trust. In particular, our results show that the effects of national culture and gender on trust are significant. For example, U.S. participants showed a lower trust level and were more sensitive to misses as compared with Indian participants. The resulting trust model is intended for the development of autonomous systems that can respond to changes in human trust level in real time.","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2018.2874188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2018.2874188","startPage":"485","endPage":"497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/8910331/08502860.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8910331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Modeling of the Dynamics of Human Trust During Human\u2013Machine Interactions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Computational Modeling of the Dynamics of Human Trust During Human\u2013Machine Interactions","volume":"49","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2019","accessionNumber":"19373757","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502860/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1548616"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Modeling of the Dynamics of Human Trust During Human\u2013Machine Interactions","sourcePdf":"thms-jain-2874188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17138S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"8910331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8910331","articleId":"8502860","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502864,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang Gong","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kuang","lastName":"Gong","orcid":"0000-0002-2669-2610","id":"37085882419"},{"name":"Jiahui Guan","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jiahui","lastName":"Guan","id":"37086515457"},{"name":"Chih-Chieh Liu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chih-Chieh","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-1968-8346","id":"37086514101"},{"name":"Jinyi Qi","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jinyi","lastName":"Qi","orcid":"0000-0002-5428-0322","id":"37269262400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2469-7311"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2469-7303"}],"articleNumber":"8502864","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1267},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502864","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Feature extraction","Image reconstruction","Phantoms","Positron emission tomography","Brain modeling","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","image denoising","lung","medical image processing","neural nets","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptual loss","pretrained VGG network","conventional mean squared error","training loss function","patient data","lung data sets","deep neural network","fine tuning","positron emission tomography","functional imaging modality","clinical diagnosis","deep convolutional neural network","PET image quality","brain data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network (CNN)","fine-tuning","image denoising","perceptual loss","positron emission tomography (PET)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TRPMS.2018.2877644","endPage":"161","startPage":"153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/7433213/8657419/08502864.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRPMS.2018.2877644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8657419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PET Image Denoising Using a Deep Neural Network Through Fine Tuning","abstract":"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality widely used in clinical diagnosis.

This exponential growth of interconnected objects increases the demand for wireless spectrum. However, providing wireless channel access to every communicating object while ensuring its guaranteed quality of service (QoS) requirements is challenging and has not yet been explored, especially for IoT-enabled mission-critical applications and services. Meanwhile, Cognitive Radio-enabled Internet of Things (CR-IoT) is an emerging field that is considered the future of IoT. The combination of CR technology and IoT can better handle the increasing demands of various applications such as manufacturing, logistics, retail, environment, public safety, healthcare, food, and drugs. However, due to the limited and dynamic resource availability, CR-IoT cannot accommodate all types of users. In this paper, we first examine the availability of a licensed channel on the basis of its primary users' activities (e.g., traffic patterns). Second, we propose a priority-based secondary user (SU) call admission and channel allocation scheme, which is further based on a priority-based dynamic channel reservation scheme. The objective of our study is to reduce the blocking probability of higher-priority SU calls while maintaining a sufficient level of channel utilization. The arrival rates of SU calls of all priority classes are estimated using a Markov chain model, and further channels for each priority class are reserved based on this analysis. We compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes in terms of the SU call-blocking probability, SU call-dropping probability, channel utilization, and throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed priority scheme outperforms the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TNSE.2018.2877646","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488902/9025091/08502867.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9025091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSE.2018.2877646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","startPage":"328","endPage":"342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of Service Provisioning for Heterogeneous Services in Cognitive Radio-Enabled Internet of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Quality of Service Provisioning for Heterogeneous Services in Cognitive Radio-Enabled Internet of Things","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502867/","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8502867/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2020","accessionNumber":"19428009","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2017R1E1A1A01073742"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of Service Provisioning for Heterogeneous Services in Cognitive Radio-Enabled Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tnse-ali-2877646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123482S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6488902","isNumber":"9025091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488902","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"9025091","articleId":"8502867","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502872,"authors":[{"name":"Jiawen Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Biomedical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502872/yang-2877587-small.gif","p":["Jiawen Yang received the B.S. degree from the School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the degree.

First a region average pooling (RAPooling) method is introduced which makes feature extraction can focus on the region of interest. Then an end-to-end classification framework combining with segmentation information is designed, which uses the segmented lesion region to guide the classification by RAPooling. Finally, a linear classifier RankOpt based on the area under the ROC curve is used to optimize and obtain the final classification result. The proposed method integrates segmentation information into the classification task, and in addition, by the optimization of RankOpt, a better classification performance for imbalanced dermoscopy image dataset is obtained. Experiments are conducted on ISBI 2017 skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection challenge dataset, and comparisons with the other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502872/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495615","htmlLink":"/document/8502872/","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Classification for Dermoscopy Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks Based on Region Average Pooling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871011, 61471016 and 61771031"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Classification for Dermoscopy Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks Based on Region Average Pooling","sourcePdf":"access-xie-2877587-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106191S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502872","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502874,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyong Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/9016330/8502874/jiang-2877614-small.gif","p":["Haiyong Jiang received his Ph.D. degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition of the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2017 and his Bachelor's degrees from University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2012.

Our main idea is to select shapes using selection-expressions instead of simple string matching used in current state-of-the-art grammars like CGA shape and CGA++. A selection-expression specifies how to select a potentially complex subset of shapes from a shape hierarchy, e.g., \u201dselect all tall windows in the second floor of the main building facade\u201d. This new way of modeling enables us to express modeling ideas in their global context rather than traditional rules that operate only locally. To facilitate selection-based procedural modeling we introduce the procedural modeling language SELEX. An important implication of our work is that enforcing important constraints, such as alignment and same size constraints can be done by construction. Therefore, our procedural descriptions can generate facade and building variations without violating alignment and sizing constraints that plague the current state of the art. While the procedural modeling of architecture is our main application domain, we also demonstrate that our approach nicely extends to other man-made","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2020","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2020","publicationDate":"1 April 2020","accessionNumber":"19449477","pubMedId":"30369446","htmlLink":"/document/8502874/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Selection Expressions for Procedural Modeling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772523"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection Expressions for Procedural Modeling","sourcePdf":"tvcg-yan-2877614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098709S","chronDate":"April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"9016330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","xplore-issue":"9016330","articleId":"8502874","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502875,"authors":[{"name":"Eung Chang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eung Chang","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0001-9673-5033","id":"37086524079"},{"name":"Jinsung Rho","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinsung","lastName":"Rho","id":"37086524292"},{"name":"Heeyoub Kang","affiliation":["Memory Division, Samsung Electronics, Hwasung, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heeyoub","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086524222"},{"name":"Bong Jae Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bong Jae","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-6842-7444","id":"37086524008"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"8502875","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":610},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502875","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Nonvolatile memory","Temperature sensors","Atmospheric measurements","Atmospheric modeling","Convection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ball grid arrays","finite element analysis","flash memories","heat transfer","integrated circuit packaging","random-access storage","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal analysis","solid-state drives","data storage","heat dissipation mechanism","vacuum environment","high-vacuum conditions","heat transfer analysis","BGA NVMe SSD","nonvolatile memory express solid-state drive","ball grid array","finite-element-method","Samsung Electronics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ball grid array (BGA)","solid state drive (SSD)","non-volatile memory express (NVMe)","thermal analysis","vacuum"]}],"abstract":"Solid-state drives (SSDs) have been widely used in data storage for micro satellites, data centers, and mobile products due to their high performance and high reliability. Recently, Samsung Electronics starts to introduce a ball grid array (BGA) non-volatile memory express (NVMe) SSD, which is a combined package of controller and memory units (i.e., DRAM and NAND) into one package. Due to the smaller form factor with high storage densities and multi-functional devices of BGA NVMe SSDs, a thermal issue becomes more important, requiring fundamental understanding of heat dissipation mechanism. Moreover, for applications in micro satellites, thermal analysis of SSDs should be conducted in vacuum environment. Here, we investigate the heat dissipation mechanism in the newly developed BGA NVMe SSD in both the atmosphere and high-vacuum conditions.

However, the current MLIN-based solutions do not provide enough sensitivity. The reason for this is that they rely on the fringing field of an MLIN that leads to a shallow penetration depth and thus low sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a sensitive MLIN-based glucose sensor using the main field. The idea is illustrated using the following three steps. Step 1 is sensing the glucose level by using the main field, which uses the material under test (MUT) as the substrate of an MLIN terminated with a load; Step 2 is identifying the contribution of different parameters and different components of parameters to sensitivity, which leads to Step 3, in which different parameters and/or different components of parameters are crosschecked for sensing. Two frequency bands, 100 to 500 MHz and 1.4 to 1.9 GHz, were investigated. In Step 1, the main field configuration was compared with its fringing field counterpart. It is shown that the proposed MLIN configuration presents an average sensitivity of 1.8\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n dB/(mg/dL) in terms of the reflection coefficient that is more than 10 times higher than that of its counterpart. In Step 2, different components of the reflection coefficient and the input impedance of the proposed configuration were examined, and their diverse contributions to the sensitivity were shown, which allows crosschecking to improve sensing accuracy. This was successfully shown in Step 3, in which algorithms for crosschecking were proposed, and the sensing accuracy was examined. In terms of the optimal sensing frequency band, 1.4 to 1.9 GHz shows higher sensitivity than 100 to 500 MHz, where the molecules may interact the most with the waves. This implies that the interaction between a wave and the sensing structure with the MUT contributes more to sensitivity than the direct interaction between the wave and the MUT. The radiofrequency safety of the proposed configuration was examined by checking the specific absorption rate of the MUT with the proposed structure. This paper offers a new avenue for the development of an MLIN-based noninvasive glucose sensor for continuous monitoring with high sensitivity in the near future. It can be used both as a single sensor and in a multiple-sensor glucose monitoring system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microstrip Line-Based Glucose Sensor for Noninvasive Continuous Monitoring

Unlike conventional interference mitigation approaches, we propose using knowledge of the data symbols and the channel state information (CSI) at the FD radio BS to exploit the multi-user interference constructively rather than to suppress it. We propose a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) via the weighted Tchebycheff method to study the tradeoff between the two desirable system design objectives, namely the total downlink transmit power and the total uplink transmit power, at the same time ensuring the required quality-of-service (QoS) for all users. In the proposed MOOP, we adapt the QoS constraints for the downlink users to accommodate constructive interference for both generic phase shift keying modulated signals and for quadrature amplitude modulated signals. We also extended our work to a robust design to study the system with imperfect uplink and downlink CSI. The simulation results and analysis show that significant power savings can be obtained. More importantly, however, the MOOP approach here allows for the power saved to be traded off for both uplink and downlink power savings, leading to an overall energy efficiency improvement in the wireless link.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Exploitation in Full-Duplex Communications: Trading Interference Power for Both Uplink and Downlink Power Savings","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2876229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8570921/08502918.pdf","startPage":"8314","endPage":"8329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2876229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8570921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Interference Exploitation in Full-Duplex Communications: Trading Interference Power for Both Uplink and Downlink Power Savings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8502918/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18321013","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/R007934/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009614","fundingName":"Petroleum Technology Development Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Interference Exploitation in Full-Duplex Communications: Trading Interference Power for Both Uplink and Downlink Power Savings","sourcePdf":"twc-kabir-2876229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111953S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8570921","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8570921","articleId":"8502918","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502919,"authors":[{"name":"Junxuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502919/jwang-2877396-small.gif","p":["Junxuan Wang received the B.E. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, in 1994, the M.E. degree from the Xi\u2019an University of Science and Technology, China, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2005.

In this paper, multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) techniques are applied to NOMA systems by considering two types of imperfect channel state information-channel distribution information (CDI) and channel estimation uncertainty. Based on the two considered channel models, the power allocation and beamforming vectors are jointly designed to maximize the system utility of MIMO-NOMA, subjected to probabilistic constraints. Due to the implementation of successive interference cancellation in NOMA, the power allocation coefficients of the users in each cluster become coupled, which complicates the rate outage probability constraints and results in two challenging non-convex problems. For the optimization problem under CDI, we propose an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm based on first-order approximation and semidefinite programming (SDP). For the optimization problem under channel estimation uncertainty, a new algorithm for the joint power allocation and receive beamforming design is developed to maximize the system utility based on SCA and an efficient 1-D search. In addition, the convergence and the feasibility are discussed for the two formulated problems. Furthermore, an efficient method to find a feasible initial solution is provided. Finally, the presented simulation results validate that the proposed two algorithms outperform MIMO-orthogonal multiple access and MIMO fixed NOMA (MIMO F-NOMA) with fixed power allocation and beamforming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502922/","volume":"17","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8502922/","accessionNumber":"18321012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability Constrained MIMO-NOMA Designs Under Imperfect CSI","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC 61731017"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"111-2-14"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N005597/1"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61728101, H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015 and 690750"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability Constrained MIMO-NOMA Designs Under Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"twc-cui-2875490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118886S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8570921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8570921","articleId":"8502922","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502926,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno M.

This paper extends a previous field-programmable gate array-based approach that automatically generates pipelined customized loop accelerators (CLAs) from runtime instruction traces. Despite efficient acceleration, the approach suffered from high area and resource requirements when offloading a large number of kernels from the target application. This paper addresses this by enhancing the CLA with dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) support. Each kernel to accelerate is implemented as a variant of a reconfigurable area of the CLA which hosts all functional units and configuration memory. Evaluation of the proposed system is performed on a Virtex7 device. We show, for a set of 21 kernels, that when comparing two CLAs capable of accelerating the same subset of kernels, the one which benefits from DPR can be up to 4.3\u00d7 smaller. Resorting to DPR allows for the implementation of CLAs which support numerous kernels without a significant decrease in operating frequency and does not affect the initiation intervals at which kernels are scheduled. Finally, the area required by a CLA instance can be further reduced by increasing the IIs of the scheduled kernels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"27","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18365368","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8502926/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration of Customized Single-Row Accelerators","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration of Customized Single-Row Accelerators","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-paulino-2874079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091757S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8595476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8595476","articleId":"8502926","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8502928,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaomei Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8502928/luo-2877267-small.gif","p":["Xiaomei Luo received the B.S. degree in industrial enterprise automation from Nanchang University, Jiangxi, China, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in communications and information system from the School of Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2015.","She is currently a Vice Professor with the School of Information Engineering, Nanchang University.

For each setup, we propose a novel centralized beamformer design method to solve the EE maximization problem, which can be transformed into a convex optimization problem using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Moreover, we develop a distributed optimization algorithm to solve the SDR approximation formulation for each setup.

For each setup, the distributed scheme has slightly worse performance than the centralized one, while enjoys less computational complexity, especially when the number of the additional energy transmitters is large.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08502928.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"65845","endPage":"65861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in MIMO Communication With Interference Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in MIMO Communication With Interference Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502928/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61661029 and 61661030"},{"fundingName":"Dr. Start-up","grantNumber":"06301229"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11501210"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in MIMO Communication With Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"access-luo-2877267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097323S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8502928","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8502931,"authors":[{"name":"Sungju Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8595476/8502931/ryu-2873716-small.gif","p":["Sungju Ryu (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea, in 2015.

The pipelined structure is usually adopted to improve the performance by reducing the length of critical paths. An increase in the number of flip-flops due to pipelining, however, generally results in significant area and power increase. A large number of flip-flops are often required to meet the feedforward-cutset rule. Based on the observation that this rule can be relaxed in machine learning applications, we propose a pipelining method that eliminates some of the flip-flops selectively.

However, most previous works ignored the limitation of battery power and scarce computing capabilities of DUEs. In this paper, we study the computation and traffic offloading in cache-aided D2MD networks for the content delivery and delay sensitive task offloading services. Firstly, in order to provide stable multicast links and enhanced computing resources, a D2D cluster head (DCH) selection strategy is proposed that jointly considers the social attributes, available energy, and transfer rate of DUEs. Secondly, to improve the efficiency of content distribution and optimize the energy consumption of content delivery, we propose a novel multicast-aware coded and cooperative caching scheme, which may increase the opportunity for D2D multicasting to obtain the desired contents. Thirdly, considering the DUEs association, uplink full duplex DCH transmission power allocation, and mobile edge computing computation resource scheduling, an optimization computation offloading model is formulated. On this basis, we model the computation offloading and resource allocation optimization problem. Furthermore, we transform this problem into user allocation optimization problem and resource allocation optimization problem (RAOP), and RAOP is proved as a convex problem, and the optimal resource allocation solution is found. Finally, the simulation results show that our proposed schemes can effectively decrease the energy consumption and computing costs.","topic":"Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18495617","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8502937/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Computation Offloading in Cache-Aided D2D Multicast Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701038"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Design of Computation Offloading in Cache-Aided D2D Multicast Networks","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2876893-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168774S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Emerging Technologies for Device to Device Communications"],"articleId":"8502937","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8502938,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8570921/8502938/sun-2876442-small.gif","p":["Wen Sun (S\u201911\u2013M\u201916) received the B.E. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology in 2009 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2014.

To address the super-frequent handovers of mobile users in such UDNs, the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) then becomes a feasible solution by effectively improving communication reliability. In this paper, we consider CoMP-based uplink transmission in heterogeneous UDNs. As our first step, a CoMP uplink transmission scheme is proposed for each user to transmit to multiple (2 to M) cooperating BSs with channel inversion power control in a multi-channel scenario. The performance of the proposed uplink CoMP is analyzed in the context of UDNs using stochastic geometry, in terms of outage probability and ergodic capacity, considering the effects of BS intensity, power control, number of cooperating nodes, and network tiers, first in a single-tier network, and later extended to a K-tier heterogeneous network. Performance evaluation through extensive simulations is conducted and it is shown that the simulation results fit well with the analytical ones. The performance of the proposed scheme is then compared with that of the non-CoMP scheme, and it is found that the proposed scheme can significantly improve outage probability and ergodic capacity of mobile users.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2876442","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8570921/08502938.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8570921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2876442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"8342","endPage":"8356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-to-- Coordinated Multipoint-Based Uplink Transmission in Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8502938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"2-to-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Coordinated Multipoint-Based Uplink Transmission in Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8502938/","volume":"17","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8502938/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18320988","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601357, 61771374 and 61771373"},{"fundingName":"China 111 Project","grantNumber":"B16037"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB181506, JB181507 and JB181508"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-to-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Coordinated Multipoint-Based Uplink Transmission in Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-sun-2876442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102581S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8570921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8570921","articleId":"8502938","onlineDate":"23 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":8502950,"authors":[{"name":"Sourya Dey","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California"],"firstName":"Sourya","lastName":"Dey","id":"37085836118"},{"name":"Kuan-Wen Huang","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California"],"firstName":"Kuan-Wen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085435873"},{"name":"Peter A.

Moreover, the LP based framework is shown to be asymptotically tight for the averaged and compound channels under the maximum probability of error criterion. Further, for multiterminal Slepian-Wolf source coding problem, a systematic approach to synthesize new converses from considering point-to-point lossless source coding (with side-information at decoder) sub-problems is introduced.

Using the coding scheme we establish a mechanism to insure data, for instance in blockchain-based cloud storage systems, based on the value of the data, by understanding the costs involved for the service provider.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2018.8503089","publicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8486613/8502949/08503089.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2018.8503089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Storage Meets Secret Sharing on the Blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Storage Meets Secret Sharing on the Blockchain","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18196733","publicationDate":"February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503089/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503089/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","conferenceDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Storage Meets Secret Sharing on the Blockchain","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Raman_DistributedStorageMeetsSharing.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101058S","chronDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486613","isNumber":"8502949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486613","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8502949","articleId":"8503089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8503100,"authors":[{"name":"Sadjad Sedighi","affiliation":["1CPCC, Dept of EECS UC Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sadjad","lastName":"Sedighi","id":"37086491080"},{"name":"Gokhan M.

Thus, there is a need for a new cellular wireless network, which is able to handle tens of billions of wireless devices. This phenomenon has an associated effect in terms of a huge increase in traffic. A number of means is under investigation to respond to that need. Among several alternatives, the category of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems is a great candidate for this purpose. Because of the large number of antennas in massive MIMO, there is a need to reduce the dimension of the MIMO channel effectively to decrease the complexity by considering the sparsity in the channel in terms of angle of arrival and delay, as introduced by the technique of Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing. This can be achieved effectively by using a particular statistical pre-beamforming technique introduced recently. In this paper, different adaptive algorithms for estimating the channel vector coefficient and their performance, based on this recent pre-beamforming technique, are studied. Different approaches are used in order to find the best algorithm based on the channel estimation accuracy and the complexity of the algorithm. As a byproduct, with the help of the provided analysis, in single-carrier time-varying massive MIMO channels, the optimal number of RF chains (required spatial dimensions) can be determined in hybrid beamforming in terms of the achievable information rate by taking the estimation accuracy of different adaptive acquisition algorithms into account.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Channel Estimators with Hybrid Beamforming for Single-Carrier Massive MIMO","publicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2018.8503100","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8486613/8502949/08503100.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2018.8503100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502949","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Channel Estimators with Hybrid Beamforming for Single-Carrier Massive MIMO","conferenceDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8503100/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"February 2018","accessionNumber":"18196740","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Channel Estimators with Hybrid Beamforming for Single-Carrier Massive MIMO","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Sedighi_AdaptiveChannelEstimators.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05996S","chronDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486613","isNumber":"8502949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486613","xplore-issue":"8502949","articleId":"8503100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8503107,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Knudde","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - imec, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Knudde","id":"37085822127"},{"name":"Ivo Couckuyt","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - imec, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ivo","lastName":"Couckuyt","id":"38233808400"},{"name":"Domenico Spina","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - imec, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Spina","id":"38020514500"},{"name":"Konstanty \u0141ukasik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Konstanty","lastName":"\u0141ukasik","id":"37085711182"},{"name":"Pawe\u0142 Barmuta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Pawe\u0142","lastName":"Barmuta","id":"38073712700"},{"name":"Dominique Schreurs","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Schreurs","id":"37266768500"},{"name":"Tom Dhaene","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - imec, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Dhaene","id":"37273161400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5204-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5203-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5205-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503107","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Bayes methods","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Linear programming","Solid modeling","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","optimisation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-efficient Bayesian optimization","power amplifier design","nonlinear electrical components","Bayesian optimization method","Wolsfspeed CGH40010F HEMT","harmonic balance simulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian optimization","Gaussian process","harmonic balance","load-pull","transistor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503107","abstract":"Finding the optimal working conditions for non-linear electrical components under large signal stimuli can be challenging, mainly due to the high number of input dimensions and multiple local minima of the goal function.

Most of the results can also be transposed to the SIMO Interfering Multiple Access Channel with linear receivers. We first point out that in the case of reduced rank covariance matrices, there is significant gain in sum rate by using LMMSE as opposed to Least-Squares (LS) channel estimates. We also analyze various beamforming designs exploiting partial CSIT. Then we go beyond assuming the availability of covariance CSIT and propose variational Bayesian learning (VBL) techniques to acquire it assuming TDD channel reciprocity. In particular a Space Alternating version of Variational Estimation (SAVE) allows a well founded alternative to AMP based techniques while being of similar complexity. The SAVE techniques can also be applied to obtain reduced complexity iterative techniques for determining the transmit/receive signals or beamformers themselves.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8486613/8502949/08503127.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2018.8503127","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2018.8503127","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Covariance matrices","Interference","MIMO communication","Convergence","Optimization","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel estimation","covariance matrices","iterative methods","linear codes","MISO communication","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear receivers","reduced rank covariance matrices","beamforming designs","partial CSIT","covariance CSIT","variational Bayesian learning techniques","TDD channel reciprocity","AMP based techniques","reduced complexity iterative techniques","channel estimation","transceiver determination","linear precoders","channel covariance information","partial channel state information","MISO interfering broadcast channel","variational estimation","least-squares channel estimates","SIMO interfering multiple access channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503127/","displayDocTitle":"Variational Bayesian Learning for Channel Estimation and Transceiver Determination","accessionNumber":"18196745","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503127/","conferenceDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Bayesian Learning for Channel Estimation and Transceiver Determination","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Kurisummoottil_VariationalBayesianLearning.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073801S","chronDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486613","isNumber":"8502949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486613","xplore-issue":"8502949","articleId":"8503127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8503132,"authors":[{"name":"smail Dilman","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Namik Kemal University, Tekirdag, Turkey"],"firstName":"smail","lastName":"Dilman","id":"37086494175"},{"name":"Egemen Bilgin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Egemen","lastName":"Bilgin","id":"37085454269"},{"name":"Sema Cosgun","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sema","lastName":"Cosgun","id":"37085651179"},{"name":"Mehmet Cayoren","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Cayoren","id":"38071524700"},{"name":"Ibrahim Akduman","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Akduman","id":"37300019500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5204-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5203-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5205-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503132","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a diffraction tomography based compressive sensing technique for the monitoring of hemorrhagic brain strokes. The method uses the measurements of the scattered field data on two different time instants. The difference between two measurements constitutes the data that has been used for the diffraction tomography. Since this data is naturally sparse, the compressive sensing technique has been applied to take advantage of the sparsity. The results of numerical tests with a realistic human head phantom suggest that this approach produces more accurate results with fewer antennas, compared to the conventional microwave diffraction tomography. In addition robustness of the method is examined with 30db and 40db white Gaussian noise. The simulations show that the new method is also more robust than the conventional approach. Overall, by combining compressive sensing technique with the microwave diffraction tomography, a more practical and robust technique for the differential imaging is proposed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Numerical Electromagnetic and Multiphysics Modeling and Optimization (NEMO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490019/8502946/08503132.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Numerical Electromagnetic and Multiphysics Modeling and Optimization (NEMO)","doi":"10.1109/NEMO.2018.8503132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMO.2018.8503132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502946","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compressive Sensing Application on Microwave Diffraction Tomography for the Microwave Imaging of a Stroke Affected Human Brain*","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Diffraction","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave imaging","Scattering","Head"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","compressed sensing","Gaussian noise","medical image processing","microwave imaging","patient monitoring","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing application","microwave imaging","stroke affected human brain","hemorrhagic brain strokes","realistic human head phantom","conventional microwave diffraction tomography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["diffraction tomography","compressive sensing","brain strokes","microwave imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Compressive Sensing Application on Microwave Diffraction Tomography for the Microwave Imaging of a Stroke Affected Human Brain*","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8503132/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197570","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compressive Sensing Application on Microwave Diffraction Tomography for the Microwave Imaging of a Stroke Affected Human Brain*","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"p87-dilman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076755S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490019","isNumber":"8502946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490019","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8502946","articleId":"8503132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8503143,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelrahman M.

To serve the users' requests, in the delivery phase, the server transmits signals that satisfy the users' distortion requirements. An optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the worst-case delivery load subject to the total cache memory budget and users' distortion requirements is formulated. The optimal solution for uncoded placement and linear delivery is characterized explicitly and is shown to exhibit a threshold policy with respect to the total cache memory budget.

MTC-based services, such as sensing, metering, and monitoring requires small volume of information in most cases. Since the current data transmission principle requires long codeblock to maximize the coding gain and hence novel transmission mechanism to support short packet transmission is required. In this paper, we propose a new type of data transmission scheme suitable for the ultra short packet transmission, called sparse vector coding (SVC). Key idea behind the proposed technique is to transmit the information after the sparse transformation. By mapping the information into the sparse vector and then transmitting it after the non-orthogonal random spreading, we cast the symbol detection problem into the sparse signal recovery problem in compressed sensing. Through performance analysis and simulations, we show that SVC is very effective in short packet transmissions.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2018.8503179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2018.8503179","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8486613/8502949/08503179.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Vector Coding for Ultra Short Packet Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Vector Coding for Ultra Short Packet Transmission","conferenceDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","publicationDate":"February 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8503179/","accessionNumber":"18196712","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503179/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Vector Coding for Ultra Short Packet Transmission","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Ji_SparseVectorCoding.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05315S","chronDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486613","isNumber":"8502949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486613","xplore-issue":"8502949","articleId":"8503179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8503180,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Arafa","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Princeton University"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Arafa","id":"38277977000"},{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406100800"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"},{"name":"H.

Through a series of 2D transformations, OTFS converts a doubly-dispersive channel into an almost non-fading channel in the delay-Doppler domain. In this domain, each symbol in a frame experiences an almost constant fade, thus achieving significant performance gains over existing modulation schemes such as OFDM. The sparse delay-Doppler impulse response which reflects the actual physical geometry of the wireless channel enables efficient channel estimation, especially in high-Doppler fading channels. This paper investigates OTFS from a signal detection and channel estimation perspective, and proposes a Markov chain Monte-Carlo sampling based detection scheme and a pseudo-random noise (PN) pilot based channel estimation scheme in the delay-Doppler domain.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2018.8503182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2018.8503182","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8486613/8502949/08503182.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On OTFS Modulation for High-Doppler Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503182/","conferenceDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","displayDocTitle":"On OTFS Modulation for High-Doppler Fading Channels","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18196715","publicationDate":"February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503182/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On OTFS Modulation for High-Doppler Fading Channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Murali_OnOTFSModulation.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099646S","chronDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486613","isNumber":"8502949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486613","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"8502949","articleId":"8503182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8503191,"authors":[{"name":"Ralf R.

The main idea is to build a neural network to learn and optimize a conventional iterative decoder of LDPC codes. A DNN is based on Tanner graph, and the activation functions emulate message update functions in variable and check nodes. We impose a symmetry on weight matrices which makes it possible to train the DNN on a single codeword and noise realizations only. Based on the trained weights and the bias, we further quantize messages in such DNN-based decoder with 3-bit precision while maintaining no loss in error performance compared to the min-sum algorithm. We use examples to present that the DNN framework can be applied to various code lengths. The simulation results show that, the trained weights and bias make the iterative DNN decoder converge faster and thus achieve higher throughput at the cost of trivial additional decoding complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503199/","conferenceDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18196719","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503199/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Decode LDPC Codes with Finite-Alphabet Message Passing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Decode LDPC Codes with Finite-Alphabet Message Passing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Vasic_LearningtoDecodeLDPCCodes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131991S","chronDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486613","isNumber":"8502949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486613","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8502949","articleId":"8503199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8503212,"authors":[{"name":"Rymarczyk Tomasz","affiliation":["University of Economics and Innovation in Lublin, Lublin, Poland"],"firstName":"Rymarczyk","lastName":"Tomasz","id":"37086492077"},{"name":"Oleszek Michal","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Lublin, Netrix S.A., Poland"],"firstName":"Oleszek","lastName":"Michal","id":"37086492711"},{"name":"Szumowski Jakub","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Lublin, Netrix S.A., Poland"],"firstName":"Szumowski","lastName":"Jakub","id":"37086492532"},{"name":"Tch\u00f3rzewski Pawel","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Lublin, Netrix S.A., Poland"],"firstName":"Tch\u00f3rzewski","lastName":"Pawel","id":"37086492416"},{"name":"Adamkiewicz Przemyslaw","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Lublin, Netrix S.A., Poland"],"firstName":"Adamkiewicz","lastName":"Przemyslaw","id":"37086496796"},{"name":"Sikora Jan","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Lublin, Netrix S.A., Poland"],"firstName":"Sikora","lastName":"Jan","id":"37086495949"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6936-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-1177-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6937-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503212","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"abstract":"The article presents an innovative solution for assessing the moisture level of walls and building condition.

Taking the physical and hardware limitations into account is crucial for characterizing the actual performance of mm Wave systems under certain architecture such as analog beamforming. In this context, we consider a broadband frequency dependent array model that explicitly includes incremental time shifts instead of phase shifts between the individual antennas and incorporates a physically defined radiated power. As a consequence of this model, we present a novel joint approach for designing the optimal waveform and beamforming vector for analog beamforming.

The encoding of such a BCH code is performed on a collection of codewords which are mapped through Galois Fourier transform into a codeword of a nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC) code which has a binary parity-check matrix for transmission. Using this matrix, a binary iterative soft-decision decoding algorithm based on belief-propagation is applied to jointly decode a collection of codewords of the BCH code. The joint-decoding allows information sharing among the received vectors corresponding to the codewords in the collection during the iterative decoding process. For decoding a BCH code of prime length, the proposed decoding scheme not only requires low decoding complexity, but also yields superior performance. The proposed decoding scheme can achieve a joint-decoding gain over the maximum likelihood decoding of individual codewords.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503231/","conferenceDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18196751","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503231/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Coding Scheme for Encoding and Iterative Soft-Decision Decoding of Binary BCH Codes of Prime Lengths","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Coding Scheme for Encoding and Iterative Soft-Decision Decoding of Binary BCH Codes of Prime Lengths","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Lin_ANovelCodingScheme.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104473S","chronDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486613","isNumber":"8502949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486613","xplore-issue":"8502949","articleId":"8503231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8503249,"authors":[{"name":"Juane Li","affiliation":["AppoTech USA, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Juane","lastName":"Li","id":"37085389627"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085670850"},{"name":"Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Abdel-Ghaffar","id":"37283329300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0124-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1995-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503249","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503249","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bipartite graph","Iterative decoding","Decoding","Complexity theory","Electronic mail","Belief propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","graph theory","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipartite graphs","Tanner graphs","parity-check equations","decoder","quasicyclic LDPC codes","parity-check matrices","locating cycles","improved trellis-based algorithm"]}],"abstract":"LDPC codes are typically decoded using belief propagation decoding algorithms applied to their Tanner graphs. Cycles of short lengths in these graphs, which are bipartite graphs representing parity-check equations of the codes, can negatively impact the performance of the decoder. In this paper, a trellis-based algorithm is presented to locate cycles in bipartite graphs. This algorithm is an improvement in complexity and run-time over the one developed by Lan et al. in 2004. When applied to Tanner graphs of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, the newly proposed algorithm can exploit the structure of their parity-check matrices to cut the complexity further. Locating cycles in the Tanner graphs of codes allows for eliminating them to increase the girth and thus improve performance.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2018.8503249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2018.8503249","publicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8486613/8502949/08503249.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Trellis-Based Algorithm for Locating and Breaking Cycles in Bipartite Graphs with Applications to LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Improved Trellis-Based Algorithm for Locating and Breaking Cycles in Bipartite Graphs with Applications to LDPC Codes","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503249/","publicationDate":"February 2018","accessionNumber":"18196727","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Trellis-Based Algorithm for Locating and Breaking Cycles in Bipartite Graphs with Applications to LDPC Codes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Li_ImprovedTrellisBasedAlgorithm.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091303S","chronDate":"11-16 Feb. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486613","isNumber":"8502949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486613","xplore-issue":"8502949","articleId":"8503249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8503261,"authors":[{"name":"Palma London","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Palma","lastName":"London","id":"37086363291"},{"name":"Shai Vardi","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Shai","lastName":"Vardi","id":"37086491683"},{"name":"Adam Wierman","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Wierman","id":"37318368400"},{"name":"Hanling Yi","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hanling","lastName":"Yi","id":"37086491599"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0124-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1995-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503261","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Acceleration","Parallel algorithms","Cloning","Linear programming","Markov random fields","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","integer programming","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exact solvers","approximate solvers","integer linear programs","parallelizable acceleration framework","linear programming problems","black box","linear programming solvers","worst-case guarantees","approximately optimal solution","variable dimension","parallel-distributed solvers"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an acceleration framework for packing linear programming problems where the amount of data available is limited, i.e., where the number of constraints m is small compared to the variable dimension n.

For this analysis a data set of the measurement periods 2015 and 2017 was used for validation of the Lightning Location System data of the Austrian Lightning Detection and Information System. The LLS performance parameter location accuracy and detection efficiency for these two years have been analyzed. Values for location accuracy are in the range of 111 m and 139 m for 2015 and 2017. For flash detection efficiency 96.08 % and 98.49 % and 85.60 % and 76.34 % for the stroke detection efficiency have been calculated for 2015 and 2017 respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503297","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482241/8503268/08503297.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LiOn Ground Truth Data in Correlation With ALDIS LLS Detections","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503297/","conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"LiOn Ground Truth Data in Correlation With ALDIS LLS Detections","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18196219","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503297/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LiOn Ground Truth Data in Correlation With ALDIS LLS Detections","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057796S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8482241","isNumber":"8503268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482241","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8503268","articleId":"8503297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8503312,"authors":[{"name":"Yijun Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086491336"},{"name":"Xiangpeng Fan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Severe Weather, Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangpeng","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086490220"},{"name":"Qiyuan Yin","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Numerical Weather Prediction, Guangzhou Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, CMA, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qiyuan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37086490954"},{"name":"Lvwen Chen","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Numerical Weather Prediction, Guangzhou Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, CMA, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lvwen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086491439"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6635-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6636-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503312","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lightning","Vegetation","Clouds","Fasteners","Electric fields","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric precipitation","clouds","disasters","lightning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convective core","horizontal distance","initiation point","precipitation","step voltage","event process","lightning strike point","fatality case","bolt","lethal event","lightning discharge","Low Frequency Electric Field Detection Array","Guangdong Lightning Location System","nearby radar station","lightning death incident","accident discharge","return stroke","current peak","cloud-toground lightning flash","lightning disaster point","Conghua","Guangzhou","AD 2017","equivalent circuit model","current -30.9 kA","size 3.6 km","size 6.0 km","voltage 78.3 kV","size 10.0 m","voltage 0.783 kV","altitude 13.0 km","altitude 2.8 km","altitude 7.0 km","distance 0.3 km","distance 3.5 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["lightning disaster","\u201cbolt from the blue\u201d","side flash","step voltage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503312","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482241/8503268/08503312.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503312","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503268","publicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a Fatality Case Caused by \u201ca Bolt from the Blue\u201d","abstract":"Investigation and analysis of a lethal event caused by a lightning discharge in Conghua, Guangzhou, in 2017, is presented in this paper. The lightning strike first hit a tree with a height of 13m, and then hit the head of a person near the tree, causing death. The data from the Low Frequency Electric Field Detection Array, Guangdong Lightning Location System, and a nearby radar station, were analyzed. The event was identified as a lightning death incident caused by \u201ca bolt from the blue\u201d. The accident discharge was found to be the first return stroke (RS) with a current peak of -30.9kA, which belonged to a cloud-toground lightning flash with seven RSs. The flash initiated at a height of about 13km. At a height of 2.8km, the horizontal distance from the lightning disaster point to the edge of precipitation (18dBZ) was about 3.6km, and to the edge of the convective core (30dBZ) was about 6km. At a height of 7km, the horizontal distance of the initiation point to the edge of precipitation (18dBZ) was about 0.3km, with the distance to the edge of the convective core (30dBZ) being about 3.5km. According to the equivalent circuit model of the lightning strike, we calculated the air breakdown voltage of the side flash and step voltage on the ground. The results indicated that the event process involved the flash hitting the tree, the current flowing to the \u201cjump point\u201d, and then the side stroke to the victim. Crucially, the victim was exposed by a step voltage of 78.3kV, while a witness, who was 10 m from the lightning strike point, was only exposed to 0.783kV.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503312/","conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18196245","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503312/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Fatality Case Caused by \u201ca Bolt from the Blue\u201d","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Fatality Case Caused by \u201ca Bolt from the Blue\u201d","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075383S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8482241","isNumber":"8503268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482241","xplore-issue":"8503268","articleId":"8503312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8503326,"authors":[{"name":"Grzegorz Karnas","affiliation":["Rzeszow University of Technology, Rzeszow, Poland"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Karnas","id":"38523362400"},{"name":"Grzegorz Maslowski","affiliation":["Rzeszow University of Technology, Rzeszow, Poland"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Maslowski","id":"37270768600"},{"name":"Piotr Baranski","affiliation":["Institute of Geophysics of Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Baranski","id":"37086098265"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6635-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6636-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503326","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503326","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lightning","Electric fields","Spectrogram","Sensors","Estimation","Channel estimation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric techniques","clouds","lightning","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightning stepped leader stage","power spectrum density spectrograms","lightning discharge","modified power density spectrograms","return stroke electric field signature","lightning channel height","lightning electric records","lightning leader discrimination","lightning flash incidents","electrostatic field component","total electric field change","location systems","electric field recordings","electric field sensors","lightning stroke","PSD spectrograms","lightning flash channel","local lightning detection system","lightning electric field records","Rzeszow region","digital high speed video camera","electric field fast antenna","cloud-to-ground flash","Poland"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["lightning leader","lightning channel","lightning location system","power spectrum density"]}],"abstract":"This paper is aimed to show how to detect and identify the lightning stepped leader stage from the power spectrum density spectrograms (PSD) of related lightning electric field records. Such electric field records were obtained from the local lightning detection system operating in the Rzeszow region. This system consists of two slow and fast electric field sensors working in the ELF and ELF-MF frequency range, respectively. Additionally, the development of the corresponding lightning flash channel can be recorded by the digital high speed video camera. The frequency bandwidth of the electric field fast antenna enable us to recognize properly all main components of lightning discharge observed from the single measuring station. On the other hand, the lightning stepped leader stage of the considered cloud-to-ground flash can be determined from the modified power density spectrograms of related lightning electric field records. Such PSD spectrograms have been integrated in respect to the frequency domain. The only-time-dependent PSD spectrograms have been recalculated by the special computer procedure called the fill factor estimation. This factor has been computed in respect to the following return stroke electric field signature. Next, the leader beginning timestamp has been determined for the particular value of the fill factor. The obtained duration of the lightning leader stage enable us to estimate the lightning channel height for simplified assumptions. The comparison of the downward negative leader model taken from the literature with our lightning electric field records is also shown. The presented computer algorithm can be used for the different kind of lightning electric records. The high efficiency of such lightning leader discrimination has been obtained especially in the cases of close lightning flash incidents when electrostatic field component of the leader stage dominates the total electric field change of the considered lightning stroke. Therefore, this method may be implemented in future by the different kind of lightning detection and location systems without a significant loss of computing power and with low costs.","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503326","publicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482241/8503268/08503326.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Discrimination of Lightning Stepped Leader Stage from the Power Spectrum Density of the Related Electric Field Recordings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Automated Discrimination of Lightning Stepped Leader Stage from the Power Spectrum Density of the Related Electric Field Recordings","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503326/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18196217","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503326/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Discrimination of Lightning Stepped Leader Stage from the Power Spectrum Density of the Related Electric Field Recordings","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089799S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8482241","isNumber":"8503268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482241","xplore-issue":"8503268","articleId":"8503326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8503341,"authors":[{"name":"Binghao Li","affiliation":["Department of Building Services Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Binghao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085534418"},{"name":"Ruihan Qi","affiliation":["Department of Building Services Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Ruihan","lastName":"Qi","id":"37086170999"},{"name":"Yaping Du","affiliation":["Department of Building Services Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Yaping","lastName":"Du","id":"37277585700"},{"name":"Mingli Chen","affiliation":["Department of Building Services Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Mingli","lastName":"Chen","id":"37423602400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6635-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6636-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503341","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"abstract":"Light rail transit is constructed in many cities to alleviate the problems of traffic jam and air pollution.

Current was measured at the top of the tower using a 0.25 \u03a9 shunt. Electric field was measured simultaneously at near (170 m from the tower) and far (79 km from the tower in 2006 - 2007 and 109 km in 2008 - 2014) distances. The initial stage (IS) of these flashes comprised of relatively slowly varying \u201cbackground\u201d current (having durations ranging from 74 to 691 ms), with faster, more impulsive current variations (pulses having durations ranging from 4.0 \u03bcs to 29 ms) overlaid on this background current. In 45 of the 58 flashes (78%) the background continuing current was negative, and in the other 13 flashes (22%) it was bipolar. 1180 current pulses occurred during the IS of these 58 flashes, of which 709 (60%) were positive bipolar (positive initial polarity with a negative opposite polarity overshoot), 27 (2.3%) were positive unipolar (positive initial polarity with no opposite polarity overshoot), 435 (37%) were negative unipolar, and nine (0.76%) were negative bipolar pulses. The median peak current for the 718 bipolar pulses was 0.16 kA and that for the 462 unipolar pulses was 0.20 kA. The 1180 IS current pulses produced 341 detectable electric field change signatures at the near station and 109 at the far stations.","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503374","publicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482241/8503268/08503374.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current and Electric Field Changes Associated with the Initial Stage of Upward Lightning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Current and Electric Field Changes Associated with the Initial Stage of Upward Lightning","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503374/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18196255","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503374/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current and Electric Field Changes Associated with the Initial Stage of Upward Lightning","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073711S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8482241","isNumber":"8503268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482241","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8503268","articleId":"8503374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8503390,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Actions to reduce this problem depend of adequate design of structures, grounding and of the associated investments. In this paper the analysis is based on the flashover and backflashover calculation due to lightning using the Alternative Transients Program ATPDraw. Parametric studies using this software are performed to determine the sensitivity of the flashover and backflashover occurrence, taking into account some parameters of the distribution line. Models of the distribution system components are also presented. The models are based on the representation of the distribution line taking into account the frequency dependence of its electrical parameters. A dedicated software is developed, which allows analyzing the lightning performance of overhead distribution feeders as a function of the characteristics of different structures, groundings, soil resistivity and ground flash density. A summary of the procedures and calculation adopted in the application of the tool is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503390","publicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482241/8503268/08503390.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology to Evaluate the Performance of Distribution Feeders Against Lightning: Fundamentals, Case Study and Computational Tool","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology to Evaluate the Performance of Distribution Feeders Against Lightning: Fundamentals, Case Study and Computational Tool","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503390/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18203775","htmlLink":"/document/8503390/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology to Evaluate the Performance of Distribution Feeders Against Lightning: Fundamentals, Case Study and Computational Tool","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08838S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8482241","isNumber":"8503268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482241","xplore-issue":"8503268","articleId":"8503390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8503394,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These models often utilise surface impedance boundary conditions (SIBCs) to represent the material of the boundary. Conformal meshes are a popular method of representing curved and non-aligned surfaces in FDTD. These meshes deform cells in the FDTD grid around the boundary between bulk materials so as to more accurately represent the shape of the material. Here we present an algorithm that combines the efficiency of a thin layer model with the accuracy of a conformal mesh. The algorithm is applied to three resonant cavity models and the accuracy verified using comparisons to non-conformal meshes and analytic solutions. Improvements are shown in the accuracy of the resonant frequencies and magnitude of the shielding effectiveness (SE) of the cavities. It is also shown to reduce the prevalence of extraneous features in the frequency response of the SE that are apparent when using a stair-cased mesh.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Numerical Electromagnetic and Multiphysics Modeling and Optimization (NEMO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490019/8502946/08503410.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Numerical Electromagnetic and Multiphysics Modeling and Optimization (NEMO)","doi":"10.1109/NEMO.2018.8503410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMO.2018.8503410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502946","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Conformal Thin Boundary Model for FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cavity resonators","Time-domain analysis","Resonant frequency","Finite difference methods","Numerical models","Surface impedance","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-value problems","cavity resonators","finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","surface impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layer model","finitedifference time-domain technique","multiscale simulations","simulation run-times","memory requirements","surface impedance boundary conditions","conformal mesh","popular method","deform cells","FDTD grid","bulk materials","resonant cavity models","nonconformal meshes","stair-cased mesh","conformal thin boundary model","curved surface","nonaligned surface","analytic solutions","resonant frequencies","cavity shielding effectiveness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-Difference Time-Domain","Conformal Techniques","Surface-Impedance Boundary Condition","Thin Layer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Conformal Thin Boundary Model for FDTD","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8503410/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197585","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Conformal Thin Boundary Model for FDTD","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"p266-bourke.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057418S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490019","isNumber":"8502946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490019","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8502946","articleId":"8503410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8503415,"authors":[{"name":"H.G.

Today, widely available networks for lightning detection offer a chance to assess alleged BL reports with located lightning and its physical parameters. This assessment was realized with BL case data and EUCLID lightning data for Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland. According to the initial flash hypothesis, the electromagnetic pulse of a detected stroke near the geocoded BL position could be the triggering event of the BL process. The lightning location system (LLS) provides stroke location, time, polarity (positive/negative), and peak current in kA. In this assessment, 34 BL case reports over the period from 1994 to 2016 suggested a physical link of the stroke with maximum peak current in kA to the subsequent BL process. No electromagnetic field values for individual strokes can be computed with the kA peak current. As a first step in this analysis, geocoded distances of less than 1 km between stroke location and BL observation site were called \\quotedblbase close event`` (CE) and distances 1-10 km \\quotedblbase distant event`` (DE). For cloud-ground (CG) strokes the stroke-to-BL distance values were obtained. LLS-provided coordinates for intra-cloud (CC) strokes were also used to obtain a distance, although CC do not have a defined striking point. 28 BL cases occurred in the summer months, 6 cases in winter. Their time pattern follows the diurnal thunderstorm frequency in Central Europe. 19 cases were from Germany, 10 from Austria, 3 from the Czech Republic and 2 from Switzerland. 19 of the correlated EUCLID strokes were positive and 15 negative. Positive strokes ranged from 4 to 370 kA, negative from -3 to -37 kA. 28 were classified by the LLS as CG, 6 as CC strokes. The mean value of the semi-major axis of the EUCLID location confidence ellipse was 0.45 km. The BL-to- stroke distance in km for CG events had a mean of 0.42 km and a range of 0.0-0.8 km for CE cases, and a mean of 5.7 km and a range of 1.4-10 km for DE cases. The case statistics of this sample showed smaller BL-stroke distances for higher kA peak currents for both negative and positive CG events. This result leads to the interpretation that most DE strokes are uncorrelated with BL since their physical effects are marginal. Replications with more BL cases will show whether the pattern holds.","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503422","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 34th International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8482241/8503268/08503422.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of ball lightning cases by correlated LLS data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503422/","conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of ball lightning cases by correlated LLS data","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18196194","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503422/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of ball lightning cases by correlated LLS data","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060107S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8482241","isNumber":"8503268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8482241","xplore-issue":"8503268","articleId":"8503422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8503444,"authors":[{"name":"Mikihisa SAITO","affiliation":["Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Mikihisa","lastName":"SAITO","id":"37982095500"},{"name":"Masaru ISHII","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaru","lastName":"ISHII","id":"37291631100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6635-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6636-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503444","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503444","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind turbines","Lightning protection","Sea measurements","Current measurement","Frequency measurement","Poles and towers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightning","lightning protection","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["upward lightning flashes","upward winter lightning","wind turbines","ordinary downward lightning flashes","upward flashes","subsequent strokes","downward flashes","return strokes characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["{/it winter lightning","upward lightning","return stroke","wind turbine"]}],"abstract":"In Japan, upward winter lightning frequently damages wind turbines in the coastal area of the Sea of Japan.

Accurate parameters, such as peak and time parameters of return stroke currents, can be promptly determined from the records. The low-cost systems include means for remote internet access, self-test and data transfer. Laboratory test have been performed to assess the consistency of the measuring system and results were presented. Three non-direct measuring systems were installed 15 m away from the instrumented tower of Morro do Cachimbo Station (MCS).

Especially overlapped subarray based hybrid beamforming architectures look promising. In this architecture a trade-off between the hardware complexity of the analogue beamforming network and the maximum achievable data rate is needed, depending on the application scenario. To keep the complexity of the analogue beamforming network low, simple overlap methods are demanded. Furthermore, the spatial location of the overlaps is crucial for the analogue beamforming network design. Within this work, we analyze and compare spatial overlap constellations in order to maximize the achievable data rate, with respect to the hardware and circuitry complexity.

The method is based on a low-cost signal sensors network, distributed in the areas of interest for the deployment of cognitive radio technologies. The sensors are connected to software that locates the data on the cartography and performs an estimation of the electromagnetic field, obtaining a radio environment map from the field measurements. The interpolation method used is the result of several interpolation methods in combination with models of propagation of radio signals and statistical, cartographic and urban distribution considerations. Also, we present the methodology for deciding whether a channel can be considered white space or a busy channel.

The calculation of the resolution and other parameters of the obtained radio environment map are also shown and explained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503755/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18196811","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","conferenceDate":"10-14 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8503755/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model for Measurement of Radio Environment Maps and location of White Spaces for Cognitive Radio Deployment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model for Measurement of Radio Environment Maps and location of White Spaces for Cognitive Radio Deployment","confLoc":"Cartagena, Colombia","sourcePdf":"397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117617S","chronDate":"10-14 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486926","isNumber":"8503665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486926","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8503665","articleId":"8503755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8503769,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086006678"},{"name":"Zhi Ning Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhi Ning","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085620415"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6765-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6764-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6766-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503769","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Dual band","Broadband antennas","Antenna measurements","Bandwidth","Dielectric resonator antennas","Slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","metamaterial antennas","microwave antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays","multifrequency antennas","substrate integrated waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-band metasurface antenna array","characteristic mode analysis","substrate integrated waveguide cavity-fed slot","5G millimeter-wave applications","frequency 36.5 GHz to 41.0 GHz","frequency 22.3 GHz to 30.6 GHz","SIW cavity-fed slot","right-angled slot etching","square patches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","antenna","array","characteristic mode analysis (CMA)","dual-band","low-profile","metasurface","millimeter-wave","substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","wideband"]}],"abstract":"A metasurface antenna array is proposed for the dual-band operation.

The focus has been on fixed multiple-input multiple-output communication links in pure line-of-sight channels. An empirical equation is presented for the mid-elements' relative position on the sides of the square array achieving near-optimal (3 x 3) x (3 x 3) multiple-input multiple-output capacity. It is observed that the position is a function of both the separation distance between transmit and receive antennas and the wavelength of the transmit signal in a similar way as for 3 x 3 systems with linear arrays. The capacity gains of the aperiodic planar array over the uniform planar array antenna configurations are presented. It is shown that considerable capacity gains in capacity can be obtained by choosing the right array topology following a simple design rule.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2018.8503781","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8486926/8503665/08503781.pdf","startPage":"734","endPage":"736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2018.8503781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Gains of (3 x 3)x(3 x 3) MIMO Fixed Links with Planar Aperiodic Sparse Arrays in Pure-LOS Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8503781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8503781/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Gains of (3 x 3)x(3 x 3) MIMO Fixed Links with Planar Aperiodic Sparse Arrays in Pure-LOS Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18196823","htmlLink":"/document/8503781/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Gains of (3 x 3)x(3 x 3) MIMO Fixed Links with Planar Aperiodic Sparse Arrays in Pure-LOS Channels","confLoc":"Cartagena, Colombia","sourcePdf":"161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046575S","chronDate":"10-14 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8486926","isNumber":"8503665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8486926","xplore-issue":"8503665","articleId":"8503781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8503782,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Rotenberg","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Rotenberg","id":"37086029324"},{"name":"Miguel Poveda-Garcia","affiliation":["Department TIC, GEAT, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Poveda-Garcia","id":"37085810155"},{"name":"Jose Luis Gomez-Tornero","affiliation":["Department TIC, GEAT, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Luis","lastName":"Gomez-Tornero","id":"38277117800"},{"name":"Carolina Mateo-Segura","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK"],"firstName":"Carolina","lastName":"Mateo-Segura","id":"38275413900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6765-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6764-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6766-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8503782","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Electromagnetic waveguides","Dual band","Leaky wave antennas","Antenna arrays","Cavity resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","leaky wave antennas","microstrip antenna arrays","microwave antenna arrays","multifrequency antennas","planar antenna arrays","satellite communication","slot antenna arrays","waveguide antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dual-band Ku-band scanning leaky-wave antenna","satellite communications","high gain planar antennas","top-open waveguide","WR-62 waveguide aperture","switchable slot patches","dual-band operation","reflection phase","slot cut","PRS reflection characteristics","frequency bands","full wave 3D electromagnetic simulations","switching diode","optimised partially reflecting surface","frequency 14.04 GHz","frequency 13.67 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["scanning leaky-wave antennas","satellite communications"]}],"abstract":"High gain planar antennas have been investigated using an optimised partially reflecting surface (PRS) placed on a top-open waveguide and fed by a WR-62 waveguide aperture.

However, the increase of power electronics-based renewable generation can dramatically reduce the inertia levels of modern power systems. This issue has already challenged the control and stability of small-scale power systems. It will soon be faced by larger power systems as the trend of large-scale renewable integration continues. In view of the urgent demand for addressing the inertia concern, this paper presents a comprehensive review of inertia enhancement methods covering both proven techniques and emerging ones and also studies the effect of inertia on frequency control. Among those proven techniques, the inertia emulation by wind turbines has successfully demonstrated its effectiveness and will receive widespread adoptions. For the emerging techniques, the virtual inertia generated by the dc-link capacitors of power converters has a great potential due to its low cost. The same concept of inertia emulation can also be applied to ultracapacitors. In addition, batteries will serve as an alternative inertia supplier, and the relevant technical challenges as well as the solutions are discussed in this paper. In future power systems where most of the generators and loads are connected via power electronics, virtual synchronous machines will gradually take over the responsibility of inertia support. In general, it is concluded that advances in semiconductors and control promise to make power electronics an enabling technology for inertia control in future power systems.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2877766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/8887420/08506338.pdf","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8887420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2877766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Inertia of Future More-Electronics Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"On the Inertia of Future More-Electronics Power Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506338/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19100690","htmlLink":"/document/8506338/","volume":"7","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Singapore, through the Energy Program and Energy Market Authority","grantNumber":"NRF2015EWT-EIRP002-007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Inertia of Future More-Electronics Power Systems","sourcePdf":"jestpe-fang-2877766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166431S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"8887420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"8887420","articleId":"8506338","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8506339,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Bianco","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8506339/bianc-2877890-small.gif","p":["Simone Bianco received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, in 2003, 2006, and 2010, respectively.

For each DNN, multiple performance indices are observed, such as recognition accuracy, model complexity, computational complexity, memory usage, and inference time. The behavior of such performance indices and some combinations of them are analyzed and discussed. To measure the indices, we experiment the use of DNNs on two different computer architectures, a workstation equipped with a NVIDIA Titan X Pascal, and an embedded system based on a NVIDIA Jetson TX1 board. This experimentation allows a direct comparison between DNNs running on machines with very different computational capacities. This paper is useful for researchers to have a complete view of what solutions have been explored so far and in which research directions are worth exploring in the future, and for practitioners to select the DNN architecture(s) that better fit the resource constraints of practical deployments and applications.

Here, a wearable affective robot that integrates the affective robot, social robot, brain wearable, and Wearable 2.0 is proposed for the first time. The proposed wearable affective robot is intended for a wide population, and we believe that it can improve the human health on the spirit level, meeting the fashion requirements at the same time. In this paper, the architecture and design of an innovative wearable affective robot, which is dubbed as Fitbot, are introduced in terms of hardware and algorithm's perspectives. In addition, the important functional component of the robot-brain wearable device is introduced from the aspect of the hardware design, EEG data acquisition and analysis, user behavior perception, and algorithm deployment. Then, the EEG-based cognition of user's behavior is realized. Through the continuous acquisition of the in-depth, in-breadth data, the Fitbot we present can gradually enrich user's life modeling and enable the wearable robot to recognize user's intention and further understand the behavioral motivation behind the user's emotion. The learning algorithm for the life modeling embedded in Fitbot can achieve better user's experience of affective social interaction. Finally, the application service scenarios and some challenging issues of a wearable affective robot are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08506341.pdf","startPage":"64766","endPage":"64776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wearable Affective Robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506341","topic":"Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing for Communication and Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506341/","displayDocTitle":"Wearable Affective Robot","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495620","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8506341/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61434001, 61875064, U1705261 and 61572220"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFC1314600"},{"fundingName":"National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals"},{"fundingName":"HUST Academic Frontier Youth Team"},{"fundingName":"Director Fund of WNLO"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HUST: 2018KFYXKJC045"},{"fundingName":"Young 1000 Talents Program, China"},{"fundingName":"Hubei Provincial Key Project","grantNumber":"2017CFA051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010888","fundingName":"Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Bureau","grantNumber":"2017010201010118"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wearable Affective Robot","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2877919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116009S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing for Communication and Network"],"articleId":"8506341","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506343,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8506343/jiang-2877798-small.gif","p":["Kun Jiang was born in Linyi, Shandong, China, in 1993.

We present the single-relay selection and multi-relay selection as well as round-robin scheduling schemes to investigate the physical-layer security of this considered HSTRN by adopting the decode-and-forward relay strategy. Specifically, in a single-relay selection scheme, a relay is chosen as the \u201cbest\u201drelay which has the maximum instantaneous capacity of relay-destination channel out of the decoding relay set, which is composed of all the relays capable to decode the received signals from the satellite successfully. By contrast, in a multi-relay selection scheme, all relays of the decoding relay set are invoked simultaneously to aid the satellite communicating with the destination. Moreover, suppose that only the main channels' state information is known while the wiretap channels' state information is unavailable due to the passive eavesdropper, we analyze the secrecy performance in accordance with secrecy outage probability of the HSTRN by driving out the closed-form expressions for the single-relay selection and baseline round-robin scheduling schemes, as well as by computer simulations for multi-relay selection scheme. Numerical results show that the two relay selection schemes generally outperform the round-robin scheduling baseline scheme in the light of improving the secrecy performance of HSTRN even when the legitimate links are inferior to the wiretap links.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08506345.pdf","startPage":"65275","endPage":"65285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Selection for Improving Physical-Layer Security in Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Relay Selection for Improving Physical-Layer Security in Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Relay Networks","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495623","htmlLink":"/document/8506345/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61522109, 61631020, 61671252, 61671253 and 91738201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150040 and BK20171446"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education in Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology","grantNumber":"JZNY201707"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information in Cognitive Dynamic System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space","grantNumber":"KF20181910"},{"fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005374","fundingName":"Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program of Graduate Education of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"KYCX17_0780"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Relay Selection for Improving Physical-Layer Security in Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"access-zou-2877709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151344S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8506345","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8506365,"authors":[{"name":"Jingtian Zhang","affiliation":["Automation School, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8506365/zhang-2877767-small.gif","p":["Jingtian Zhang received the B.S. degree from the School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2010.

However, most algorithms focus on the number of vehicles, while the travel distance should be considered as the primary objective in some practical situations, especially in the modern logistics. Research has shown that designing a systematic framework to combine multiple algorithms with different characteristics will significantly improve the overall performance of the hybrid algorithm. This paper proposes an evolutionary scatter search particle swarm optimization algorithm (ESS-PSO) to solve the VRPTW with the objective of minimizing the total travel distance. In ESS, a genetic algorithm and a new \u201croute+/-\u201d evolutionary operator are introduced in scatter search template. In addition, we proposed a discrete PSO that sets the route-segment as the velocity of particles and in which the velocity and position updating rules are designed based on the concept of \u201cruin and recreate.\u201dThese two algorithms work in a cascade learning architecture, in which PSO learns from the exemplary solutions in the reference set maintained by ESS. The search direction of the algorithm is adjusted by analyzing the relationship between the number of vehicles and the total travel distance in real time. We designed a new solution representation called \u201cauxiliary code\u201dbased on customer allocation to maintain the diversity of the reference set. Experiments with the Solomon benchmark show that ESS-PSO is effective and efficient, and it achieves very competitive results, especially in the datasets of the category \u201c2.\u201d","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877767","startPage":"63468","endPage":"63485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08506365.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evolutionary Scatter Search Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem With Time Windows","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506365/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Evolutionary Scatter Search Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem With Time Windows","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8506365/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18509064","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Evolutionary Scatter Search Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem With Time Windows","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2877767-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147734S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8506365","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8506382,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8506382/xzhan-2877786-small.gif","p":["Xiang Zhang (GS\u201917) received the master\u2019s degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2016.

With the widespread connectivity of everyday devices realized by the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), BCI can empower individuals to directly control objects such as smart home appliances or assistive robots, directly via their thoughts. However, realization of this vision is faced with a number of challenges, most importantly being the issue of accurately interpreting the intent of the individual from the raw brain signals that are often of low fidelity and subject to noise. Moreover, preprocessing brain signals and the subsequent feature engineering are both time-consuming and highly reliant on human domain expertise. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a unified deep learning-based framework that enables effective human-thing cognitive interactivity in order to bridge individuals and IoT objects. We design a reinforcement learning-based selective attention mechanism (SAM) to discover the distinctive features from the input brain signals. In addition, we propose a modified long short-term memory to distinguish the interdimensional information forwarded from the SAM. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed framework, we conduct extensive real-world experiments and demonstrate that our model outperforms a number of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. Two practical real-time human-thing cognitive interaction applications are presented to validate the feasibility of our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8709863/08506382.pdf","startPage":"2084","endPage":"2092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2877786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2877786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8709863","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internet of Things Meets Brain\u2013Computer Interface: A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Enabling Human-Thing Cognitive Interactivity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Internet of Things","Brain-computer interfaces","Brain modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","cognition","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCI","smart home appliances","assistive robots","subsequent feature engineering","input brain signals","actuation devices","deep learning-based framework","IoT","reinforcement learning","brain-computer interface","human-thing cognitive interactivity","selective attention mechanism","SAM","Internet of things","long short-term memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI)","cognitive","deep learning (DL)","Internet of Things (IoT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Internet of Things Meets Brain\u2013Computer Interface: A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Enabling Human-Thing Cognitive Interactivity","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8506382/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18653993","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internet of Things Meets Brain\u2013Computer Interface: A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Enabling Human-Thing Cognitive Interactivity","sourcePdf":"jiot-zhang-2877786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089647S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8506382","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506395,"authors":[{"name":"Jiliang Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/8630102/8506395/zhang-2877737-small.gif","p":["Jiliang Zhang received the PhD degree in computer science and technology from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2015.

The Ring Oscillator (RO) PUF is one of the most popular weak PUFs that can generate the volatile key by comparing the frequency difference between any two ROs. However, it is difficult for the RO PUF to maintain an absolutely stable response with operating environment varies. In order to eliminate the impact of environment factors, previous RO PUFs incur significant hardware overheads to improve the reliability. This paper proposes a frequency offset-based RO PUF structure which exhibits high reliability and low hardware overhead. The key idea is to make the frequency difference larger than a given threshold by offsetting the frequencies of RO pairs to improve reliability. Prototype implementation on Xilinx 65 nm Field-programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) shows the low overhead of the new structure and 100 percent reliability with temperature range of 45

wireless network into the coding constraint. However, random selection policy is assumed at each node to select its retrieval subset, which cannot avoid illness in code graph at the sink. In this paper, the concept of indicator matrix is proposed to regulate the retrieval subset selection to derive the enhanced ANCC (EANCC) scheme. It is unveiled that the indicator matrix based retrieval subset selection policy can effectively tailor the girth and degree characteristics of the resultant code graph. Since the most harmful short cycles in the network coded cooperation can be completely eliminated, the proposed EANCC approach promises better error performance than the existing ANCC scheme. Numerical results show that it performs 13 dB better than the ANCC scheme at the bit error rate performance of $10^{-5}$ in seven-user network over the Rayleigh block fading channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506396/","volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8506396/","accessionNumber":"18344960","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Adaptive Network Coded Cooperation for Wireless Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771406"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170818114014753"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou Municipal Government","grantNumber":"201605030014"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016GXNSFFA380011"},{"fundingName":"Major Frontier Project of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2015JY0282"},{"fundingName":"NSAF","grantNumber":"U1530117"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Adaptive Network Coded Cooperation for Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2877904-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159094S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8506396","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8506399,"authors":[{"name":"Lennon Chaves","affiliation":["Federal University of Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/24/8552524/8506399/chave-2873260-small.gif","p":["Lennon Chaves received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering and\n the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil, in 2015 and 2018,\n respectively.","He has also studied at Nokia Teaching Institute, where he started his career in computer science.

Nonetheless, there is little effort focused on applying those methods to the control-system domain, especially when it comes to the investigation of low-level implementation errors, which are related to digital controllers and hardware compatibility. The present study addresses the mentioned problems and proposes the application of a bounded model checking tool, named as Digital System Verifier (DSVerifier), to the verification of digital-system implementation issues, in order to investigate problems that emerge in digital controllers designed for UAV attitude systems. A verification methodology to search for implementation errors related to finite word-length effects (e.g., arithmetic overflows and limit cycles), in UAV attitude controllers, is presented, along with its evaluation, which aims to ensure correct-by-design systems. Experimental results show that low-level failures in UAV attitude control software used in aerial surveillance are identified by DSVerifier, which can also be used for developing sound and correct implementations, through its integration into development processes. Finally, given that the proposed approach handles C code and takes into account hardware specifications, it is suitable for verifying final controller implementations, which is a more practical scenario.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSVerifier-Aided Verification Applied to Attitude Control Software in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","doi":"10.1109/TR.2018.2873260","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/8552524/08506399.pdf","startPage":"1420","endPage":"1441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2018.2873260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8552524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506399/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"DSVerifier-Aided Verification Applied to Attitude Control Software in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8506399/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18285617","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Brazilian agencies FAPEAM","grantNumber":"062.00719/2016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSVerifier-Aided Verification Applied to Attitude Control Software in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tr-chaves-2873260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19156S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"8552524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8552524","articleId":"8506399","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506406,"authors":[{"name":"Ubaid Ullah","affiliation":["Engineering Optimization and Modeling Center, Reykjavik University, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Ubaid","lastName":"Ullah","orcid":"0000-0003-3893-5525","id":"38235007700"},{"name":"Slawomir Koziel","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Slawomir","lastName":"Koziel","orcid":"0000-0002-9063-2647","id":"37270222900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"8506406","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":909},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Geometry","Bandwidth","Optimization","Coplanar waveguides","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","coplanar waveguides","electromagnetic wave polarisation","impedance matching","microstrip antennas","microstrip lines","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry parameters","CP operating band","miniaturized footprint","simple feeding technique","exciting orthogonal components","rectangular bracket-shape parasitic strip","vertical components","asymmetrical geometry","compact footprint","microstrip line","ground plane","broadband circularly polarized wide-slot antenna","coplanar waveguide","protruded stub","EM-driven optimization","C-band","impedance matching","axial ratio","frequency 3.6 GHz to 6.85 GHz","gain 3.3 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circularly polarized (CP) antenna","compact antennas","EM-driven design","wideband antennas","wide-slot antennas"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a novel and simple feeding technique for exciting orthogonal components in a wide-slot antenna.

The proposed method employs a variable-equivalent-parameter MTPA control law to calculate the MTPA current references. Different from conventional MTPA control laws, this novel MTPA control law equivalently considers both the influence of the motor parameter values as well as the influence of the derivatives of motor parameters with respect to d- and q-axis currents on the MTPA control. Therefore, the proposed method can achieve the accurate MTPA control under different load conditions. In addition, this novel MTPA control law avoids the computation of derivatives of motor parameters and the complicated computations that exist in conventional MTPA control laws. Thus, the proposed method can provide the MTPA current references easily and in real time, allowing for fast MTPA control to be achieved. Both simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed MTPA method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Torque","Mathematical model","Table lookup","Synchronous motors","Permanent magnets","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","electric current control","machine control","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motor drives","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MTPA current references","variable-equivalent-parameter MTPA control law","interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor drives","motor parameter values","maximum torque per ampere control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM)","maximum torque per ampere (MTPA)","MTPA control law","parameter variation","variable equivalent parameter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2018.2877740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8704166/08506408.pdf","startPage":"7092","endPage":"7102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8704166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2018.2877740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) Control for IPMSM Drives Based on a Variable-Equivalent-Parameter MTPA Control Law","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) Control for IPMSM Drives Based on a Variable-Equivalent-Parameter MTPA Control Law","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506408/","volume":"34","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8506408/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18636062","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) Control for IPMSM Drives Based on a Variable-Equivalent-Parameter MTPA Control Law","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2877740-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079182S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8704166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8704166","articleId":"8506408","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":8506419,"authors":[{"name":"Ashok Kumar Das","affiliation":["Center for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8614370/8506419/das-2877690-small.gif","p":["Ashok Kumar Das (M\u201917\u2013SM\u201918) received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics, M.Tech. degree in computer science and data processing, and Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Center for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India.

However, as the smart devices share the information with each other using an open channel, i.e., Internet, so security and privacy of the shared information remains a paramount concern. There exist some solutions in the literature for preserving security and privacy in IIoT environment. However, due to their heavy computation and communication overheads, these solutions may not be applicable to wide category of applications in IIoT environment. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new biometric-based privacy preserving user authentication (BP2UA) scheme for cloud-based IIoT deployment. BP2UA consists of strong authentication between users and smart devices using preestablished key agreement between smart devices and the gateway node. The formal security analysis of BP2UA using the well-known real-or-random model is provided to prove its session key security. Moreover, an informal security analysis of BP2UA is also given to show its robustness against various types of known attacks. The computation and communication costs of BP2UA in comparison to the other existing schemes of its category demonstrate its effectiveness in the IIoT environment. Finally, the practical demonstration of BP2UA is also done using the NS2 simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8614370/08506419.pdf","startPage":"4900","endPage":"4913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2877690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2877690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8614370","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biometrics-Based Privacy-Preserving User Authentication Scheme for Cloud-Based Industrial Internet of Things Deployment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Biometrics (access control)","Smart cards","Protocols","Internet of Things","Smart devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometrics","Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)","key agreement","NS2 simulation","security","user authentication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Biometrics-Based Privacy-Preserving User Authentication Scheme for Cloud-Based Industrial Internet of Things Deployment","volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8506419/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007258","fundingName":"Fundo para o Desenvolvimento Tecnol\u00f3gico das Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es","grantNumber":"01.14.0231.00"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico","grantNumber":"309335/2017-5"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometrics-Based Privacy-Preserving User Authentication Scheme for Cloud-Based Industrial Internet of Things Deployment","sourcePdf":"jiot-rodrigues-2877690-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133353S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8614370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"8614370","articleId":"8506419","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506421,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Qin","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8577058/8506421/qin-2877910-small.gif","p":["Meng Qin received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China, in 2012 and the M.S. degree in information and communication systems from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2015.

Self-healing (SH) is an essential functionality to allow the networks to automatically detect and compensate for cell outages, which typically occur when unexpected network failures arise. In this paper, reaping the benefits of machine learning, we propose a novel SH framework in ultra dense small cell networks for meeting the demands of low-cost and fast network operation, quality of service (QoS), and energy efficiency. The proposed SH scheme comprises small cell outage detection (SCOD) and small cell outage compensation (SCOC) to enable self-healing in ultra dense small cell networks. Based on the context information of the partial key performance indicator (KPI) statistics, we propose a novel SCOD algorithm to detect the outage by applying support vector data description (SVDD) approach. The SCOD algorithm detects a small cell outage efficiently considering two situations: KPIs available situation and non-KPIs available situation. Furthermore, in order to compensate the small cell outage, SCOC is formulated as a network utility maximization problem to optimally compensate for the outaged zone in small cell network. A distributed compensation algorithm with low computational complexity is developed to balance the load of small cell networks, considering the QoS provision for users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SH scheme can detect the small cell outage efficiently and can achieve an optimized QoS performance when compensating for the detected small cell outage.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microcell networks","Microprocessors","Quality of service","5G mobile communication","Machine learning","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","energy conservation","fault tolerant computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","quality of service","support vector machines","telecommunication network reliability","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra dense small cell networks","wireless networks","network failures","network operation","machine learning aided context-aware self-healing management","quality of service","energy efficiency","small cell outage detection","SCOD","small cell outage compensation","SCOC","context information","partial key performance indicator statistics","KPI","support vector data description","SVDD","distributed compensation algorithm","computational complexity","network utility maximization problem","SH scheme","self-organizing network","QoS provision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-organizing network (SON)","self-healing (SH)","cell outage","machine learning","key performance indicator (KPI)","load balancing","ultra dense networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2877910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8577058/08506421.pdf","startPage":"12339","endPage":"12351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2877910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning Aided Context-Aware Self-Healing Management for Ultra Dense Networks With QoS Provisions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning Aided Context-Aware Self-Healing Management for Ultra Dense Networks With QoS Provisions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506421/","volume":"67","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8506421/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18345023","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471287"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2014K1A3A1A20034987"},{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning Aided Context-Aware Self-Healing Management for Ultra Dense Networks With QoS Provisions","sourcePdf":"tvt-qin-2877910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113991S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8506421","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8506423,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Mohanani","affiliation":["M3S Group, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/9290149/8506423/mohan-2877759-small.gif","p":["Rahul Mohanani received the BEng degree from Mumbai University, and the MSc degree from Lancaster University.

Although extensively explored in cognitive psychology, investigations concerning cognitive biases have only recently gained popularity in software engineering research. This paper therefore systematically maps, aggregates and synthesizes the literature on cognitive biases in software engineering to generate a comprehensive body of knowledge, understand state-of-the-art research and provide guidelines for future research and practise. Focusing on bias antecedents, effects and mitigation techniques, we identified 65 articles (published between 1990 and 2016), which investigate 37 cognitive biases. Despite strong and increasing interest, the results reveal a scarcity of research on mitigation techniques and poor theoretical foundations in understanding and interpreting cognitive biases. Although bias-related research has generated many new insights in the software engineering community, specific bias mitigation techniques are still needed for software professionals to overcome the deleterious effects of cognitive biases on their work.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2018.2877759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9290149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2018.2877759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/9290149/08506423.pdf","startPage":"1318","endPage":"1339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Biases in Software Engineering: A Systematic Mapping Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Biases in Software Engineering: A Systematic Mapping Study","volume":"46","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2020","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8506423/","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2020","accessionNumber":"20240806","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506423/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006196","fundingName":"Oulun Yliopisto"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Biases in Software Engineering: A Systematic Mapping Study","sourcePdf":"tse-mohanani-2877759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228642S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"9290149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"9290149","articleId":"8506423","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8506425,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangchao Yao","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence, FEIT, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8548629/8506425/yao-2877939-small.gif","p":["Jiangchao Yao received the B.S. degree in information engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2013.

However, the label noise among datasets severely degenerates the performance of deep learning approaches. Recently, one mainstream is to introduce the latent label to handle label noise, which has shown promising improvement in the network designs. Nevertheless, the mismatch between latent labels and noisy labels still affects the predictions in such methods. To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic model, which explicitly introduces an extra variable to represent the trustworthiness of noisy labels, termed as the quality variable. Our key idea is to identify the mismatch between the latent and noisy labels by embedding the quality variables into different subspaces, which effectively minimizes the influence of label noise. At the same time, reliable labels are still able to be applied for training. To instantiate the model, we further propose a contrastive-additive noise network (CAN), which consists of two important layers: 1) the contrastive layer that estimates the quality variable in the embedding space to reduce the influence of noisy labels and 2) the additive layer that aggregates the prior prediction and noisy labels as the posterior to train the classifier. Moreover, to tackle the challenges in optimization, we deduce an SGD algorithm with the reparameterization tricks, which makes our method scalable to big data. We validate the proposed method on a range of noisy image datasets. Comprehensive results have demonstrated that CAN outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2877939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8548629/08506425.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2877939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8548629","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning From Noisy Image Labels With Quality Embedding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning From Noisy Image Labels With Quality Embedding","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506425/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18320550","pubMedId":"30369444","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8506425/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"The High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA015801"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61521062"},{"fundingName":"STCSM","grantNumber":"18DZ2270700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FT130100746, DP180100106 and LP150100671"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning From Noisy Image Labels With Quality Embedding","sourcePdf":"tip-tsang-2877939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112575S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8548629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8548629","articleId":"8506425","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506426,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaming Yan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8572808/8506426/yan-2874268-small.gif","p":["Jiaming Yan (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in intelligence science and technology from the Xi\u2019an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xianyang, China, in 2014.

Several experiments including cart-based SAR imaging with three trajectories, cart-based vital-SAR-imaging, and drone-based multitrajectory vital-SAR-imaging were carried out to reveal the capability and distinct operational features of the proposed system. Experimental results demonstrate that the system has the ability to obtain SAR imaging results in different scenes with multiple trajectories, and the human target could be effectively distinguished from other stationary objects. The results show that the lowest human target location error is 0.06 m in a 4 m \u00d7 9 m indoor region, which illustrates the great potential for search and rescue applications.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2874268","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8572808/08506426.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8572808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2874268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"5852","endPage":"5862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vital-SAR-Imaging With a Drone-Based Hybrid Radar System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Vital-SAR-Imaging With a Drone-Based Hybrid Radar System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506426/","volume":"66","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8506426/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18325144","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871224 and 81601568"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BE2018729"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"30917011316"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vital-SAR-Imaging With a Drone-Based Hybrid Radar System","sourcePdf":"tmtt-yan-2874268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080642S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8572808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8572808","articleId":"8506426","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":8506428,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0001-6119-058X","id":"37085490659"},{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-1029-9280","id":"37085483647"},{"name":"Junbin Gao","affiliation":["Discipline of Business Analytics, The University of Sydney Business School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Junbin","lastName":"Gao","orcid":"0000-0001-9803-0256","id":"37085734503"},{"name":"Xue Li","affiliation":["University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Li","id":"38560355100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-9210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0077"}],"articleNumber":"8506428","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1089},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits &amp; Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506428","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Measurement","Visualization","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Convolution","Computer architecture","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","image recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","object recognition","pedestrians","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local convolutional features","spatial gated recurrent units","paired pedestrian videos","deep Siamese attention networks","matching persons","disjoint camera views","video fragments","discriminative feature learning","metric learning","temporal information","spatial information","spatiotemporal video representations","video-based person reidentification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video-based person re-identification","gated recurrent units","spatial correlations","visual attention"]}],"abstract":"Video-based person re-identification (re-id) is a central application in surveillance systems with a significant concern in security. Matching persons across disjoint camera views in their video fragments are inherently challenging due to the large visual variations and uncontrolled frame rates. There are two steps crucial to person re-id, namely, discriminative feature learning and metric learning. However, existing approaches consider the two steps independently, and they do not make full use of the temporal and spatial information in the videos. In this paper, we propose a Siamese attention architecture that jointly learns spatiotemporal video representations and their similarity metrics. The network extracts local convolutional features from regions of each frame and enhances their discriminative capability by focusing on distinct regions when measuring the similarity with another pedestrian video. The attention mechanism is embedded into spatial gated recurrent units to selectively propagate relevant features and memorize their spatial dependencies through the network. The model essentially learns which parts (where) from which frames (when) are relevant and distinctive for matching persons and attaches higher importance therein. The proposed Siamese model is end-to-end trainable to jointly learn comparable hidden representations for paired pedestrian videos and their similarity value. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of each component of the proposed deep network while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2018.2877886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8720290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2018.2877886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/8720290/08506428.pdf","startPage":"1412","endPage":"1424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Where-and-When to Look: Deep Siamese Attention Networks for Video-Based Person Re-Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Where-and-When to Look: Deep Siamese Attention Networks for Video-Based Person Re-Identification","volume":"21","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8506428/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18692050","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506428/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP 160104075"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61806035"},{"fundingName":"ARC Discovery Projects funding","grantNumber":"DP140102270"},{"fundingName":"University of Sydney Business School ARC Bridging Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Where-and-When to Look: Deep Siamese Attention Networks for Video-Based Person Re-Identification","sourcePdf":"tmm-wang-2877886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.249456S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8720290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8720290","articleId":"8506428","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8506429,"authors":[{"name":"Eepuri Kiran Kumar","affiliation":["Biomechanics and Vision Computing Research Center, Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation (Deemed to be University), Guntur, India"],"firstName":"Eepuri Kiran","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085501308"},{"name":"P.

Therefore, we propose a new color-coded feature map called joint angular velocity maps to accurately model the 3-D joint motions. Instead of using traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we propose to develop a new ResNet architecture called connived feature ResNet, which has a CNN layer in the feedforward loop of the densely connected standard ResNet architecture. We show that this architecture avoids using dropout in the last layers and achieves the desired goal in less number of iterations compared to other ResNet and CNN based architectures used for sign (action) classification.

This paper has shown that leveraging multi-view information is able to provide a rich and comprehensive description. One of the core problems is how to sufficiently represent multi-view data in the analysis. In this paper, we introduce a tensor-based representation learning method for multi-view clustering (tRLMvC) that can unify heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-view feature spaces to a low-dimensional shared latent feature space and improve multi-view clustering performance. To sufficiently capture plenty multi-view information, the tRLMvC represents multi-view data as a third-order tensor, expresses each tensorial data point as a sparse t-linear combination of all data points with t-product, and constructs a self-expressive tensor through reconstruction coefficients. The low-dimensional multi-view data representation in the shared latent feature space can be obtained via Tucker decomposition on the self-expressive tensor. These two parts are iteratively performed so that the interaction between self-expressive tensor learning and its factorization can be enhanced and the new representation can be effectively generated for clustering purpose. We conduct extensive experiments on eight multi-view data sets and compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results have shown that tRLMvC outperforms the baselines in terms of various evaluation metrics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor-Based Low-Dimensional Representation Learning for

division multiplexing (OFDM) digital filter multiple access (DFMA) passive optical networks (PONs) are, for the first time, proposed and extensively investigated, where digital signal processing (DSP) based software-reconfigurable digital filtering is employed for each individual OFDM signal from various optical network units (ONUs), and a single fast Fourier transform operation and its following data recovery processes are implemented in a pipelined approach in the optical line terminal. As a direct result of combining both OFDMA and DFMA PON characteristics, the proposed hybrid OFDM-DFMA PON still maintains highly desirable features associated with DFMA PONs, more importantly, it also offers a number of unique advantages including great relaxation of digital filter DSP complexity and considerable reduction in transceiver cost, significantly enhanced upstream PON performance and its robustness and flexibility, as well as excellent backward compatibility with existing OFDM-based 4G networks. In this paper, an analytical hybrid OFDM-DFMA PON model is developed, and numerical simulations are performed to verify the validity of the proposed technique and also to examine the upstream hybrid OFDM-DFMA PON performance characteristics over representative 25-km standard single mode fibre IMDD PON systems. It is shown that in comparison with the DFMA PONs, the hybrid OFDM-DFMA PON can improve the upstream ONU EVM performance by >10 dB for relatively large received optical powers, and also increases the differential ONU launch power dynamic range by as large as 16 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid OFDM-Digital Filter Multiple Access PONs","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2877840","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8520944/08506434.pdf","startPage":"5640","endPage":"5649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2877840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2018","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid OFDM-Digital Filter Multiple Access PONs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/8506434/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"18243413","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ser Cymru National Research Network in Advanced Engineering and Materials","grantNumber":"NRN024 and NRN147"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid OFDM-Digital Filter Multiple Access PONs","sourcePdf":"jlt-giddings-2877840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125104S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8520944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8520944","articleId":"8506434","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506446,"authors":[{"name":"Aref Rasoulzadeh Zali","affiliation":["Nano Plasmo-Photonic Research Group, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Aref Rasoulzadeh Zali was born in Tabriz, Iran, in 1986.

For network operators, monitoring QoE is challenging due to lack of access to video streaming applications, user devices, or servers. Thus, network operators need to rely on the network traffic to infer key metrics that influence video QoE. Furthermore, with content providers increasingly encrypting the network traffic, the task of QoE inference from passive measurements has become even more challenging. In this paper, we present a methodology called eMIMIC that uses passive network measurements to estimate key video QoE metrics for encrypted HTTP-based Adaptive Streaming (HAS) sessions. eMIMIC uses packet headers from network traffic to model a HAS session and estimate video QoE metrics such as average bitrate and re-buffering ratio. We evaluate our methodology using network traces from a variety of realistic conditions and ground truth of two popular video streaming services collected using a lab testbed. eMIMIC estimates re-buffering ratio within 1 percentage point of ground truth for up to 70% sessions and average bitrate with error under 100 kbps for up to 80% sessions. We also compare eMIMIC with recently proposed machine learning-based QoE estimation methodology. We show that eMIMIC can predict average bitrate with 2.8%-3.2% higher accuracy and re-buffering ratio with 9.8%-24.8% higher accuracy without requiring any training on ground truth QoE metrics.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of experience","Streaming media","Bit rate","Cryptography","Estimation","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","error statistics","hypermedia","quality of experience","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoE inference","passive network measurements","key video QoE metrics","ground truth QoE metrics","HTTP-based video QoE metrics","encrypted network traffic","content providers","network operators","video streaming applications","user-perceived quality of experience","encrypted HTTP-based adaptive streaming"]}],"doi":"10.23919/TMA.2018.8506519","publicationTitle":"2018 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488332/8506485/08506519.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/TMA.2018.8506519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"eMIMIC: Estimating HTTP-Based Video QoE Metrics from Encrypted Network Traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"eMIMIC: Estimating HTTP-Based Video QoE Metrics from Encrypted Network Traffic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506519/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8506519/","accessionNumber":"18196836","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"eMIMIC: Estimating HTTP-Based Video QoE Metrics from Encrypted Network Traffic","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"01_tma2018_paper51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08645S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488332","isNumber":"8506485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488332","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8506485","articleId":"8506519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8506558,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Aceto","affiliation":["NM2 s.r.l., Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Aceto","id":"37400260900"},{"name":"Domenico Ciuonzo","affiliation":["NM2 s.r.l., Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Ciuonzo","id":"37086014170"},{"name":"Antonio Montieri","affiliation":["University of Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Montieri","id":"37085853757"},{"name":"Antonio Pescap\u00e9","affiliation":["NM2 s.r.l., Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Pescap\u00e9","id":"37272996300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-903176-09-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7152-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8506558","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1910},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Payloads","Protocols","Feature extraction","Performance evaluation","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","mobile radio","pattern classification","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile-traffic patterns","hand-held devices","mobile traffic volumes","enterprise networks","highly-valuable profiling information","encrypted protocols","deep packet inspection","automatically-extracted features","mobile encrypted traffic classification","deep learning","machine learning","traffic classifiers","privacy issues","Internet","mobile applications","human user activity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["traffic classification","mobile apps","Android apps","iOS apps","encrypted traffic","deep learning","automatic feature extraction"]}],"abstract":"The massive adoption of hand-held devices has led to the explosion of mobile traffic volumes traversing home and enterprise networks, as well as the Internet. Procedures for inferring (mobile) applications generating such traffic, known as Traffic Classification (TC), are the enabler for highly-valuable profiling information while certainly raise important privacy issues. The design of accurate classifiers is however exacerbated by the increasing adoption of encrypted protocols (such as TLS), hindering the applicability of highly-accurate approaches, such as deep packet inspection. Additionally, the (daily) expanding set of apps and the moving-target nature of mobile traffic makes design solutions with usual machine learning, based on manually-and expert-originated features, outdated. For these reasons, we suggest Deep Learning (DL) as a viable strategy to design traffic classifiers based on automatically-extracted features, reflecting the complex mobile-traffic patterns. To this end, different state-of-the-art DL techniques from TC are here reproduced, dissected, and set into a systematic framework for comparison, including also a performance evaluation workbench. Based on three datasets of real human users' activity, performance of these DL classifiers is critically investigated, highlighting pitfalls, design guidelines, and open issues of DL in mobile encrypted TC.","publicationTitle":"2018 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488332/8506485/08506558.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Encrypted Traffic Classification Using Deep Learning","doi":"10.23919/TMA.2018.8506558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/TMA.2018.8506558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Encrypted Traffic Classification Using Deep Learning","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"18196844","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8506558/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Encrypted Traffic Classification Using Deep Learning","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"08_tma2018_paper40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06364S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488332","isNumber":"8506485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488332","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8506485","articleId":"8506558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8506600,"authors":[{"name":"Yahui Liu","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Remote Sensing Laboratory, School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8674707/8506600/liu-2870871-small.gif","p":["Yahui Liu received the M.E. degree from the School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2018.","He has authored several international conference papers.

This paper presents a novel method for extracting road networks from VHR remotely sensed images in complex urban scenes. Inspired by image segmentation, edge detection, and object skeleton extraction, we develop a multitask convolutional neural network (CNN), called RoadNet, to simultaneously predict road surfaces, edges, and centerlines, which is the first work in such field. The RoadNet solves seven important issues in this vision problem: 1) automatically learning multiscale and multilevel features [gained by the deeply supervised nets (DSN) providing integrated direct supervision] to cope with the roads in various scenes and scales; 2) holistically training the mentioned tasks in a cascaded end-to-end CNN model; 3) correlating the predictions of road surfaces, edges, and centerlines in a network model to improve the multitask prediction; 4) designing elaborate architecture and loss function, by which the well-trained model produces approximately single-pixel width road edges/centerlines without nonmaximum suppression postprocessing; 5) cropping and bilinear blending to deal with the large VHR images with finite-computing resources; 6) introducing rough and simple user interaction to obtain desired predictions in the challenging regions; and 7) establishing a benchmark data set which consists of a series of VHR remote sensing images with pixelwise annotation. Different from the previous works, we pay more attention to the challenging situations, in which there are lots of shadows and occlusions along the road regions. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets show the superiority of our proposed approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2870871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2870871","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2056","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8674707/08506600.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8674707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RoadNet: Learning to Comprehensively Analyze Road Networks in Complex Urban Scenes From High-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"RoadNet: Learning to Comprehensively Analyze Road Networks in Complex Urban Scenes From High-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images","publicationDate":"April 2019","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2019","volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8506600/","accessionNumber":"18547518","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506600/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41571436"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005064","fundingName":"Hebei Province Science and Technology Support Program","grantNumber":"2015BAA027"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41271431"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004610","fundingName":"Science and Technology Support Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BE2014866"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RoadNet: Learning to Comprehensively Analyze Road Networks in Complex Urban Scenes From High-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-liu-2870871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111455S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8674707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8674707","articleId":"8506600","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":8506603,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Ling","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8674707/8506603/ling-2872900-small.gif","p":["Qiang Ling received the B.Eng. degree in measurement engineering and the M.Eng. degree in control science and engineering from Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2013 and 2016.

The algorithm is based on the concept that a background pixel can be approximately represented as a sparse linear combination of its spatial neighbors while an anomaly pixel cannot if the anomalies are removed from its neighborhood. To be physically meaningful, the sum-to-one and nonnegativity constraints are imposed to abundance vector based on the linear mixture model, and the upper bound constraint on sparsity level is removed for better recovery of the test pixel. First, the proposed method utilizes the redundant background information to automatically remove anomalies from the background dictionary. Then, the reconstruction error obtained by the new background dictionary is directly used for anomaly detection. Moreover, a kernel version of the proposed method is also derived to completely exploit the nonlinear feature of hyperspectral data. An important advantage of the proposed methods is their capability to adaptively model the background even when some anomaly pixels are involved. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three real hyperspectral data sets. It is demonstrated that the proposed detectors achieve a promising detection performance with a relatively low computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2872900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8674707/08506603.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2872900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8674707","startPage":"2358","endPage":"2371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Constrained Sparse Representation Model for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Constrained Sparse Representation Model for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18547508","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8506603/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61605242, 61602499 and 61471371"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012152","fundingName":"National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents","grantNumber":"BX201600172"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Constrained Sparse Representation Model for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ling-2872900-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108731S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8674707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8674707","articleId":"8506603","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506606,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8674707/8506606/liu-2872830-small.gif","p":["Bing Liu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China, in 2013, and 2016, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include machine learning, pattern recognition, and hyperspectral image classification."]},"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-0848-8453","id":"37086352288"},{"name":"Xuchu Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8674707/8506606/xyu-2872830-small.gif","p":["Xuchu Yu received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China, in 1997.","He is currently a Professor and a Doctoral Supervisor with the Information Engineering University.

However, training a deep-learning classifier notoriously requires hundreds or thousands of labeled samples. In this paper, a deep few-shot learning method is proposed to address the small sample size problem of HSI classification. There are three novel strategies in the proposed algorithm. First, spectral-spatial features are extracted to reduce the labeling uncertainty via a deep residual 3-D convolutional neural network. Second, the network is trained by episodes to learn a metric space where samples from the same class are close and those from different classes are far. Finally, the testing samples are classified by a nearest neighbor classifier in the learned metric space. The key idea is that the designed network learns a metric space from the training data set. Furthermore, such metric space could generalize to the classes of the testing data set. Note that the classes of the testing data set are not seen in the training data set. Four widely used HSI data sets were used to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve better classification accuracy than the conventional semisupervised methods with only a few labeled samples.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2872830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2872830","startPage":"2290","endPage":"2304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8674707/08506606.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8674707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Few-Shot Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep Few-Shot Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2019","accessionNumber":"18547516","publicationDate":"April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8506606/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41801388"},{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Project in Henan Province","grantNumber":"152102210014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Few-Shot Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bing-2872830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.234242S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8674707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"8674707","articleId":"8506606","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8506608,"authors":[{"name":"Garima Chopra","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8784345/8506608/chopr-2875518-small.gif","p":["Garima Chopra (GS\u201916) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication from Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, India, in 2013, and the M.Tech. degree in communication and information technology from the Electronics and Communication Department, National Institute of Technology Srinagar, Srinagar, India, in 2016.

The conventional approach of encryption is not suitable to provide desired level of security as a result of increased scalability. Thus, physical layer protection is stressed to ensure secure transmission to users in dense environment. In this paper, we examine the security challenges of high speed users for ultradense network under dense picocells deployment. Initially, we consider a dense condition where users are randomly distributed within the picocell. Targeting the problem of security for vehicular users, we propose a beam broadening (BB) and beam merging (BM) techniques that ensure reliable transmission between source and destination. We prove the effectiveness of proposed approach through mathematical and simulation analysis that guarantees high QoS and secure communication. Based on the above formulations, we examine the reliability and potential capability of BB and BM with the measurement of fairness security assessment (FSA). Numerical results demonstrate that BM and BB can achieve higher value of secrecy rate and FSA, in comparison to conventional beamforming. To end this, the complexity analysis is performed in terms of beam generations as a function of speed of user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18881501","htmlLink":"/document/8506608/","displayDocTitle":"Novel Beamforming Approach for Secure Communication in UDN to Maximize Secrecy Rate and Fairness Security Assessment","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"5G and IoT Laboratory, DoECE"},{"fundingName":"TBIC-Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra"},{"fundingName":"TEQIP-III"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Beamforming Approach for Secure Communication in UDN to Maximize Secrecy Rate and Fairness Security Assessment","sourcePdf":"jiot-jha-2875518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123268S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8784345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8784345","articleId":"8506608","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8506611,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangchen Li","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8746731/8506611/li-2870713-small.gif","p":["Jiangchen Li received the B.Eng. degree in electronic science and technology and the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics and solid state electronics from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

By exploiting the potential of RSE in existing pilots all over the world, this key component in connected vehicle networks can be used to achieve greater positioning accuracy than GPS positioning. The proposed method utilizes RSS data, which is commonly available in all connected vehicle networks, to update the GPS position and improve its accuracy based on a Bayesian approach. A method for lane positioning at a specific point is presented first, and then an extension to enable real-time lane positioning is proposed. Two typical types of RSE deployments for different traffic flow demands are considered, and the performance of the proposed method in each deployment is assessed. The proposed method features higher accuracy than existing GPS positioning methods and low complexity. To evaluate the proposed method, simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate high accuracy and robustness. Moreover, field tests are also conducted, and the outcomes show that the proposed method can recognize the lane in which the target vehicle is traveling.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2018.2870713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8746731/08506611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2018.2870713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8746731","startPage":"2644","endPage":"2656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RSE-Assisted Lane-Level Positioning Method for a Connected Vehicle Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RSE-Assisted Lane-Level Positioning Method for a Connected Vehicle Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"18777109","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8506611/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Transport Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RSE-Assisted Lane-Level Positioning Method for a Connected Vehicle Environment","sourcePdf":"tits-qiu-2870713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17717S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8746731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8746731","articleId":"8506611","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506612,"authors":[{"name":"Masataka Ohira","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, Saitama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8602378/8506612/ohira-2873366-small.gif","p":["Masataka Ohira (S\u201903\u2013M\u201906) received the B.E., M.E., and D.E. degrees from Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2001, 2003, and 2006, respectively.","From 2006 to 2010, he was with the ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Kyoto, where he was engaged in research and development of small smart antennas, millimeter-wave circuits and antennas for wireless communications.

To this end, intrinsic frequency dependence of interresonator couplings is employed instead of external controls, but the design has faced a difficulty of realizing ideal frequency curves of coupling coefficients at all the coupling regions, including nonadjacent couplings. To overcome such a difficulty, this paper introduces a frequency-curve shape design approach considering upward- or downward-curved convex that is dependent on the types of interresonator coupling. As illustrative examples, fourth- and sixth-order tunable BPFs are proposed and designed, starting from a coupling-matrix synthesis. Their structural parameters can be efficiently designed with the proposed design method. The frequency agility with keeping a constant ABW, acceptable low insertion loss, a good in-band return loss level, and TZs is numerically and experimentally demonstrated for both fourth- and sixth-order tunable BPFs.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2873366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8602378/08506612.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2873366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8602378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupling-Matrix-Based Systematic Design of Single-DC-Bias-Controlled Microstrip Higher Order Tunable Bandpass Filters With Constant Absolute Bandwidth and Transmission Zeros","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Coupling-Matrix-Based Systematic Design of Single-DC-Bias-Controlled Microstrip Higher Order Tunable Bandpass Filters With Constant Absolute Bandwidth and Transmission Zeros","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8506612/","accessionNumber":"18400928","volume":"67","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"16K18101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006091","fundingName":"Support Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology Research Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupling-Matrix-Based Systematic Design of Single-DC-Bias-Controlled Microstrip Higher Order Tunable Bandpass Filters With Constant Absolute Bandwidth and Transmission Zeros","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ohira-2873366-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073119S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8602378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8602378","articleId":"8506612","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8506618,"authors":[{"name":"Xianhao Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8605558/8506618/chen-2876526-small.gif","p":["Xianhao Chen received the B.Eng. degree from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2017.

The RN is assumed to operate in either half-duplex relaying (HDR) mode or full-duplex relaying (FDR) mode. Based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the dynamic power allocation problems under HDR and FDR schemes are formulated respectively, with the objective of maximizing the minimum user achievable rate. After demonstrating the quasi-concavity of the considered problems, we derive the optimal closed-form power allocation policies under the HDR scheme and the FDR scheme. Then, a hybrid relaying scheme dynamically switching between HDR and FDR schemes is further designed. Moreover, we also study the fixed power allocation problems for the considered CDRT-NOMA systems based on statistical CSI so as to optimize the long-term system performance. The simulations show that our proposed power allocation policies can significantly enhance the performance of CDRT-NOMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2876526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8605558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2876526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8605558/08506618.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocations for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Over 5G Full/Half-Duplex Relaying Mobile Wireless Networks","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8605558/8506618-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocations for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Over 5G Full/Half-Duplex Relaying Mobile Wireless Networks","volume":"18","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8506618/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18392501","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506618/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61731017 and 61601377"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Project","grantNumber":"U1709219"},{"fundingName":"Marie Curie Fellowship","grantNumber":"792406"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1408601 and CNS-1205726"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Project","grantNumber":"U1709219"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Optimal Power Allocations for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Over 5G Full/Half-Duplex Relaying Mobile Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2876526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171468S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8605558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8605558","articleId":"8506618","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8506619,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihua Xia","affiliation":["Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9039765/8506619/xia-2874281-small.gif","p":["Zhihua Xia (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Hunan City University, Yiyang, China, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2011.","He is an Associate Professor with the School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China.

However, similar to the other biometric identification technologies, fingerprint recognition is vulnerable to artificial replicas made from cheap materials, such as silicon, gelatin, etc. Thus, it is especially necessary to distinguish whether a given fingerprint is a live or a spoof one prior to such authentication. In order to solve the problems above, a novel local descriptor named Weber local binary descriptor for fingerprint liveness detection (FLD) has been proposed in this paper. The method consists of two components: the local binary differential excitation component that extracts intensity-variance features and the local binary gradient orientation component that extracts orientation features. The co-occurrence probability of the two components is calculated to construct a discriminative feature vector, which is fed into support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is intuitively analyzed on the image samples and numerically demonstrated by Mahalanobis distance. Experiments are performed on two public databases from FLD competitions from 2011 and 2013. The results have proved that the proposed method obtains the best detection accuracy among the existing image local descriptors in FLD.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2874281","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/9039765/08506619.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9039765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2018.2874281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","startPage":"1526","endPage":"1536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Weber Local Binary Descriptor for Fingerprint Liveness Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Weber Local Binary Descriptor for Fingerprint Liveness Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506619/","volume":"50","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8506619/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2020","accessionNumber":"19507945","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Basic Research Programs-Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK20181407, BK20150925 and BK20151530"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672294"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"R2016L13"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502242, 61702276, U1536206, U1405254, 61772283, 61602253, 61601236 and 61572258"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFB1003205"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2016R1D1A1B03933294"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012246","fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"},{"fundingName":"Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology Fund, China"},{"fundingName":"BK21+ Program from the Ministry of Education of South Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Weber Local Binary Descriptor for Fingerprint Liveness Detection","sourcePdf":"tsmc-xia-2874281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118692S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9039765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"9039765","articleId":"8506619","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8506620,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Ge","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, China","Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9321228/8506620/ge-2874305-small.gif","p":["Chao Ge received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2015.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, China, as well as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea.

Considering the effect of controller gain fluctuation and communication delay, a novel sampled-data control scheme with variable sampling interval is designed for each agent. By developing some new terms, an improved piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to take full advantage of characteristic about real sampling pattern. Furthermore, some relaxed matrices constructed in the LKF are not necessarily positive definite. Making full use of the LKF and free-matrix-based integral inequality, some sufficient criteria are developed to ensure the consistency of the MAS. Then, by solving a group of linear matrix inequalities with the maximal sampling interval, the desired sampled-data control gain matrix is obtained. Finally, the numerical example of a 5-agent system is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8506620/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2021","accessionNumber":"20287024","volume":"51","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonfragile Consensus of Multiagent Systems Based on Memory Sampled-Data Control","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503120"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"F2016209382"},{"fundingName":"Fostering Talents Foundation of North China University of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"JP201511"},{"fundingName":"Excellent Going Abroad Experts\u2019 Training Program in Hebei Province"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Programs through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1A2B2004671"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonfragile Consensus of Multiagent Systems Based on Memory Sampled-Data Control","sourcePdf":"tsmc-park-2874305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117053S","chronDate":"Jan.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9321228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9321228","articleId":"8506620","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8506621,"authors":[{"name":"Asif Abdullah Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Asif Abdullah Khan received the bachelor's degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna, Bangladesh, where his research was focused on III-nitride material based semiconductor devices and their modeling and characterization.

Toward that end, it is vital to exploit all degrees of freedom of wireless networks efficiently, so that the service quality is not sacrificed. In order to reap the benefits of flexible networking, we propose a spatial network configuration (SNC) scheme, which can result in efficient networking; both from the perspective of network capacity and profitability. First, the SNC utilizes the drone-base-stations (drone-BSs) to configure access points. Drone-BSs are shifting paradigms of heterogeneous wireless networks by providing radically flexible deployment opportunities. On the other hand, their limited endurance and potential high cost increase the importance of utilizing drone-BSs efficiently. Therefore, second, user mobility is exploited via user-in-the-loop (UIL), which aims at influencing users' mobility by offering incentives. The proposed uncoordinated SNC is a computationally efficient method, yet, it may be insufficient to exploit the synergy between the drone-BSs and UIL. Hence, we propose a joint SNC, which increases the performance gain along with the computational cost. Finally, the semi-joint SNC combines the benefits of the joint SNC with computational efficiency. The numerical results show that the semi-joint SNC is two orders of magnitude faster than the joint SNC, and a profit of more than 15% can be obtained compared to conventional systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","volume":"18","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18470417","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2019","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8506622/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Configuration of Agile Wireless Networks With Drone-BSs and User-in-the-loop","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Huawei Technologies"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Configuration of Agile Wireless Networks With Drone-BSs and User-in-the-loop","sourcePdf":"twc-boryaliniz-2874230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173328S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8638654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8638654","articleId":"8506622","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8506623,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Gharbieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8570921/8506623/gharb-2876522-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Gharbieh received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from the University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan, in 2016.

There are two main approaches to handle the surge in uplink (UL) traffic that the IoT is expected to generate, namely, scheduled UL (SC-UL) and random access uplink (RA-UL) transmissions. SC-UL is perceived as a viable tool to control quality-of-service levels while entailing some overhead in the scheduling request prior to any UL transmission. On the other hand, RA-UL is a simple single-phase transmission strategy. While this obviously eliminates scheduling overheads, very little is known about the scalability of RA-UL. At this critical junction, there is a dire need to analyze the scalability of these two paradigms. To that end, this paper develops a spatiotemporal mathematical framework to analyze and assess the performance of SC-UL and RA-UL. The developed paradigm jointly utilizes stochastic geometry and queuing theory. Based on such a framework, we show that the answer to the scheduling versus random access paradox actually depends on the operational scenario. Particularly, the RA-UL scheme offers low access delays but suffers from limited scalability, i.e., cannot support a large number of IoT devices. On the other hand, SC-UL transmission is better suited for higher device intensities and traffic rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18321019","htmlLink":"/document/8506623/","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal Model for Uplink IoT Traffic: Scheduling and Random Access Paradox","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal Model for Uplink IoT Traffic: Scheduling and Random Access Paradox","sourcePdf":"twc-gharbieh-2876522-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149598S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8570921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8570921","articleId":"8506623","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506624,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Passalis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8721184/8506624/passa-2872995-small.gif","p":["Nikolaos Passalis received the B.Sc. degree in informatics and the M.Sc. degree in information systems from the Aristotle University of Salonica, Salonica, Greece, in 2013 and 2015, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Artificial Intelligence and Information Analysis Laboratory, Department of Informatics, University of Salonica.","His current research interests include machine learning, computational intelligence, and information retrieval."]},"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Passalis","orcid":"0000-0003-1177-9139","id":"37085793507"},{"name":"Anastasios Tefas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8721184/8506624/tefas-2872995-small.gif","p":["Anastasios Tefas received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in informatics from the Aristotle University of Salonica, Salonica, Greece, in 1997 and 2002, respectively.","From 1997 to 2002, he was a Researcher and a Teaching Assistant with the Department of Informatics, University of Salonica, and he was a temporary Lecturer from 2003 to 2004.

The proposed method is inspired from the bag-of-features model and can be used for learning more lightweight deep neural networks. Trainable radial basis function neurons are used to quantize the activations of the final convolutional layer, reducing the number of parameters in the network and allowing for natively classifying images of various sizes. The proposed method employs differentiable quantization and aggregation layers leading to an end-to-end trainable CNN architecture. Furthermore, a fast linear variant of the proposed method is introduced and discussed, providing new insight for understanding convolutional neural architectures. The ability of the proposed method to reduce the size of CNNs and increase the performance over other competitive methods is demonstrated using seven data sets and three different learning tasks (classification, regression, and retrieval).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18692027","pubMedId":"30369453","htmlLink":"/document/8506624/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2019","volume":"30","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Training Lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Using Bag-of-Features Pooling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","grantNumber":"731667"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training Lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Using Bag-of-Features Pooling","sourcePdf":"tnnls-passalis-2872995-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104351S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8721184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8721184","articleId":"8506624","onlineDate":"24 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8506642,"authors":[{"name":"Ismael Abdulrahman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ismael Abdulrahman, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ismael","lastName":"Abdulrahman","orcid":"0000-0003-4048-6511","id":"37086491657"},{"name":"Ghadir Radman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ghadir Radman, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ghadir","lastName":"Radman","id":"37294743600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-8688"}],"articleNumber":"8506642","dbTime":"43 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":628},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Canada","url":"http://www.ieee.ca/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Generators","Static VAr compensators","Delay effects","Rotors","Power system stability","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","compensation","damping","delays","frequency response","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","oscillations","PD control","power system control","power system interconnection","power system measurement","power system stability","robust control","rotors","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping interarea oscillations","frequency response analysis","ANFIS-based controller","adaptability","intelligent system","robust system","adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system","fuzzy systems","neural network","complex nonlinear problems","human knowledge-based control rules","fuzzy logic controller","stability problems","weak tie-lines","interconnected power systems","low-frequency interarea oscillation","wide-area-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy SVC controller","time-domain simulations","Simulink-based package","two-area four-machine test system","time delay","adaptive parameters","proportional-plus-derivative time-delay compensator","generator rotor speed deviations","wide-area measurement system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)","phasor measurement unit (PMU)","static var compensator (SVC)","time-delay compensation","wide-area measurement system (WAMS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506642","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2018.2868754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2018.2868754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506641","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/8506641/08506642.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-Area-Based Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy SVC Controller for Damping Interarea Oscillations","abstract":"Low-frequency interarea oscillation is a major problem in interconnected power systems with weak tie-lines that causes several stability problems if not damped. Fuzzy logic controller can generate human knowledge-based control rules to solve complex nonlinear problems. Unlike a neural network, fuzzy systems cannot learn from data, and it takes a long time to modify the membership functions. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a robust and intelligent system that integrates the capabilities of fuzzy logic and neural networks with several advantages such as adaptability, robustness, rapidity, and flexibility. In this paper, an ANFIS-based controller is proposed for controlling the reactive power provided by static var compensator to damp interarea oscillations. The controller input is a remote signal provided by a wide-area measurement system, and it is calculated as the center-of-inertia difference of generator rotor speed deviations. Moreover, a proportional-plus-derivative time-delay compensator with adaptive parameters is added to the controller to reduce the influence of time delay. A two-area four-machine test system is used and simulated with a Simulink-based package developed for the work of this paper. The time-domain simulations and frequency response analysis demonstrate the capability of the proposed controller to effectively damp interarea oscillations, under a small- and large-scale disturbances and against a wide range of time delays and load uncertainty.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8506642/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2018","publicationDate":"Summer 2018","accessionNumber":"18184677","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wide-Area-Based Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy SVC Controller for Damping Interarea Oscillations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-Area-Based Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy SVC Controller for Damping Interarea Oscillations","sourcePdf":"cjece-abdulrahman-2868754-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075715S","chronDate":"Summer  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"8506641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8506641","articleId":"8506642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8506643,"authors":[{"name":"Nhat-Quang Nhan","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, CNRS UMR 6285, \u00c9cole nationale d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Brest, Universit\u00e9 Bretagne Loire, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Nhat-Quang","lastName":"Nhan","orcid":"0000-0002-4439-6575","id":"37086377044"},{"name":"Pascal Morel","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, CNRS UMR 6285, \u00c9cole nationale d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Brest, Universit\u00e9 Bretagne Loire, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Morel","orcid":"0000-0002-6671-1185","id":"37605484100"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Azou","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, CNRS UMR 6285, \u00c9cole nationale d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Brest, Universit\u00e9 Bretagne Loire, Brest, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Azou","orcid":"0000-0001-8185-7134","id":"37374949500"},{"name":"Michel Morvan","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, CNRS UMR 6285, IMT Atlantique Bretagne-Pays de la Loire, Universit\u00e9 Bretagne Loire, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Morvan","id":"37297058700"},{"name":"Philippe Gravey","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, CNRS UMR 6285, IMT Atlantique Bretagne-Pays de la Loire, Universit\u00e9 Bretagne Loire, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Gravey","orcid":"0000-0002-4320-0964","id":"37320869400"},{"name":"Erwan Pincemin","affiliation":["Orange Labs Networks, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Erwan","lastName":"Pincemin","orcid":"0000-0003-2704-2457","id":"37271489600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"8506643","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Channel estimation","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Presents corrections to the paper, \u201cSparse preamble design for polarization division multiplexed COOFDM/ OQAM channel estimation,\u201d (Nhan, N.-Q., et al), J.

In this paper, we present a method of generating all functional elementary circuit topologies. This paper uses combinatorics to ensure that all unique circuit topologies are generated and stored in a database. This database contains 582 two-transistor and 56 280 three-transistor functional and unique elementary circuit topologies. It is envisioned that the circuit topologies stored in the database can save design time and assist designers by both offering previously unknown circuit topologies and providing circuit topologies for further optimizations. To give an example of how this vision can be used in practice, a search for all amplifier circuits was conducted that resulted in 5177 circuit topologies, some previously unknown, out of 56 862 three-transistor elementary circuit topologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2018","publicationDate":"Summer 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8506644/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18193863","volume":"41","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Method of Generating Unique Elementary Circuit Topologies M\u00e9thode de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de topologies de circuits \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires uniques","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000046","fundingName":"National Research Council Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008459","fundingName":"University of Calgary"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN/358707-2013 and RT731053"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009192","fundingName":"Alberta Innovates"},{"fundingName":"Compute/Calcul Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008676","fundingName":"CMC Microsystems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Method of Generating Unique Elementary Circuit Topologies M\u00e9thode de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de topologies de circuits \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires uniques","sourcePdf":"cjece-belostotski-2859621-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12091S","chronDate":"Summer  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"8506641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","xplore-issue":"8506641","articleId":"8506644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8506707,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

The results show the feasibility of the proposed approach combining genetic method with finite element method.","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2018.8506715","publicationTitle":"2018 XIII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 XIII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8478646/8506678/08506715.pdf","startPage":"892","endPage":"898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2018.8506715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of a Spoke-Type Permanent Magnet Motor by Combination of Genetic Algorithm and Finite Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506715/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a Spoke-Type Permanent Magnet Motor by Combination of Genetic Algorithm and Finite Element Method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18195774","htmlLink":"/document/8506715/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a Spoke-Type Permanent Magnet Motor by Combination of Genetic Algorithm and Finite Element Method","confLoc":"Alexandroupoli, Greece","sourcePdf":"0892-af-003328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091439S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8478646","isNumber":"8506678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8478646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8506678","articleId":"8506715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8506724,"authors":[{"name":"Shaddrack Yaw Nusenu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaddrack Yaw","lastName":"Nusenu","id":"37086118243"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4233-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4234-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-9448"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2326-9413"}],"articleNumber":"8506724","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Chirp","Clutter","Object detection","Radar detection","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chirp modulation","Doppler shift","object detection","OFDM modulation","radar clutter","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test","adaptive design algorithm","transmitting waveform","OFDM chirp waveform pulse","OFDM chirp radar","chirp radar target detection","clutter environment","peak to average power ratio","time-bandwidth product","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing chirp waveform","moving target detection","PAPR","measurement model","Doppler shift","Doppler noise","hypothesis test","ambiguity function","empirical cumulative distribution function","ECDF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ambiguity function","generalized likelihood ratio test","OFDM chirp radar","Target detection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing chirp waveform is proposed for moving target detection in clutter environment. Unlike the OFDM waveform, the proposed waveform has better peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and offers larger time-bandwidth product which is suitable for target detection. In this scheme, the OFDM chirp waveform is employed to formulate a measurement model which considers multiple frequencies under the environment of doppler shift and noise. Based on this model, hypothesis test is developed using Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) by exploiting the advantages of OFDM chirp waveform. In addition, adaptive design algorithm is incorporated in the model for the next transmitting waveform. Furthermore, we present a possible implementation of an OFDM chirp waveform pulse with its ambiguity function. Performance analysis has also been done in terms of empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF). The results demonstrate the superiority of the OFDM chirp radar over OFDM radar in target detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8506724","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490494/8506680/08506724.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8506724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Chirp Radar Target Detection and Adaptive Design In Clutter Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506724/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Chirp Radar Target Detection and Adaptive Design In Clutter Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197703","htmlLink":"/document/8506724/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Chirp Radar Target Detection and Adaptive Design In Clutter Environment","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"OFDM-Chirp-Radar-Shaddrack-5564797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064936S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490494","isNumber":"8506680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490494","xplore-issue":"8506680","articleId":"8506724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8506767,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The vibration or current signals are the most commonly used in bearing fault diagnosis (BFD). However, their applications are also limited by some disadvantages. This study addresses a novel BFD method based on speed sensorless observer and angular resample(AR). Based on the analysis of the effect on the rotor speed signal caused by bearing faults in permanent magnetic synchronous machine (PMSM), a speed sensorless observer is designed to obtain the rotor angle and speed for reducing the cost and maintenance of the optical encoder. The angle and speed signal are pre-processed to fit the demand of the AR method, and the angle signal is used to resample the non-stationary speed signal into a stationary one in angular domain for the order spectrum analysis. The existence of excitation at the bearing fault characteristic order in the spectrum of the resampled signal is used for fault diagnosis. Experimental studies are carried out in both speed-varying and torque-varying conditions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the detection of bearing faults of PMSM.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Synchronous motors","Torque","Fault diagnosis","Observers","Time-domain analysis","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","machine bearings","mechanical engineering computing","observers","permanent magnet motors","rotors","signal processing","synchronous machines","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["order spectrum analysis","bearing fault characteristic order","angular resample","PMSM","torque-varying conditions","BFD method","AR","angular domain","nonstationary speed signal","angle signal","rotor angle","permanent magnetic synchronous machine","rotor speed signal","speed sensorless observer","vibration","motor failures","bearing faults","speed sensorless algorithm","load conditions","time-varying speed","fault diagnosis","resampled signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bearing fault diagnosis (BFD)","permanentmagnet synchronous motor (PMSM)","angular resample (AR)","speed sensorless control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2018.8506849","publicationTitle":"2018 XIII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 XIII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8478646/8506678/08506849.pdf","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2018.8506849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Time-Varying Speed and Load Conditions via Speed Sensorless Algorithm and Angular Resample","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Time-Varying Speed and Load Conditions via Speed Sensorless Algorithm and Angular Resample","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506849/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8506849/","accessionNumber":"18203615","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Time-Varying Speed and Load Conditions via Speed Sensorless Algorithm and Angular Resample","confLoc":"Alexandroupoli, Greece","sourcePdf":"1775-af-007315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062175S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8478646","isNumber":"8506678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8478646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8506678","articleId":"8506849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8506851,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A design space of different rotor geometries is created and simulated using a finite element package to evaluate the self- and mutual-correlation of different physical performances, such as average torque, torque ripple, iron power loss, saliency ratio, sound pressure level, and mechanical stress caused by centrifugal and magnetic forces. Then, a statistical analysis is conducted to extract knowledge for relating the design and objective spaces with each other. It is demonstrated that not all the objectives must be incorporated into the design process since some of them are non-conflicting. Hence, a motor designer can numerically evaluate which design variables should be changed and by how much in order to fulfill the design specifications. Lastly, multiple designs are selected based on different requirements. Useful guidelines for selecting the appropriate motor speed and voltage ratings are proposed while considering structurally-reliable designs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2018.8506851","publicationTitle":"2018 XIII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 XIII International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8478646/8506678/08506851.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"485","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2018.8506851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach For Design Knowledge Extraction of Synchronous Reluctance Machines Using Multi-Physical Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach For Design Knowledge Extraction of Synchronous Reluctance Machines Using Multi-Physical Analysis","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8506851/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18196044","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506851/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Approach For Design Knowledge Extraction of Synchronous Reluctance Machines Using Multi-Physical Analysis","confLoc":"Alexandroupoli, Greece","sourcePdf":"0479-af-002194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088634S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8478646","isNumber":"8506678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8478646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8506678","articleId":"8506851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8506912,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Kwabena Mensah","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University for Development Studies, Navrongo, Ghana"],"firstName":"Patrick Kwabena","lastName":"Mensah","id":"37086496068"},{"name":"Edem K.

On the other hand, the FPGA has proven to be an excellent platform for accelerating the algorithm in addition to its low cost and power consumption. This paper therefore proposes the use of the parallelism and carry-free propagation properties of Residue Number Systems (RNS) to accelerate the algorithm on an FPGA; a deviation from the usual binary/decimal implementations. Compared to the only previous known work that uses RNS for this task, our implementation is (1) the first to employ the use of Linear Systolic Arrays (LSA), (2) avoid the use of Lookup Tables, (3) has a larger dynamic range and (4) aligns long sequences. Implemented on a modest hardware and on a Kintex7 FPGA, we achieved a performance improvement of 169 times over the general-purpose processor implementation. This result was obtained using the na\u00efve implementation of LSAs, indicating the positive effects of using RNS.","doi":"10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8506912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506680","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490494/8506680/08506912.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8506912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RNS Smith-Waterman Accelerator based on the moduli set 2<sup>n</sup>, 2<sup>n-1</sup>, 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Dynamic range","Hardware","DNA","Acceleration","Parallel processing","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","residue number systems","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RNS Smith-Waterman Accelerator","moduli set","Smith-Waterman algorithm","power consumption","Residue Number Systems","Linear Systolic Arrays","Kintex7 FPGA","CPU","LSA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA","FPGA","Smith-Waterman","RNS","sequence alignment","dynamic programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"RNS Smith-Waterman Accelerator based on the moduli set 2<sup>n</sup>, 2<sup>n-1</sup>, 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506912/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8506912/","accessionNumber":"18197699","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RNS Smith-Waterman Accelerator based on the moduli set 2<sup>n</sup>, 2<sup>n-1</sup>, 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"PID5566015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082291S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490494","isNumber":"8506680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490494","xplore-issue":"8506680","articleId":"8506912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8506915,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Trollip","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Science, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Trollip","id":"37086211931"},{"name":"Khmaies Ouahada","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Science, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Khmaies","lastName":"Ouahada","id":"37269569500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4233-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4234-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-9448"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2326-9413"}],"articleNumber":"8506915","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"abstract":"Spectral null codes has a wide range of applications, and it has been shown that the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of messages in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems can be shaped to have nulls at designed frequencies. Peak to average power ratio (PAPR) is a common problem with OFDM, resulting in power intensive and more expensive modulators which are not suitable for modern mobile devices with limited battery life. The use of PAPR reduction techniques in OFDM is crucial in order to make it compatible with modern devices. We investigate the effect of spectral null codes on the performance of the OFDM system. In particular we focus on the bit error rate performance (BER) and the PAPR performance. We show that the use of spectral null codes has no negative impact on either the BER or PAPR performance, as expected. We conclude that the spectral null coding technique may be used to shape the PSD in OFDM systems without causing any significant negative impact on performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490494/8506680/08506915.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","doi":"10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8506915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8506915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506680","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Spectral Null Codes on PAPR and BER Performance in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Performance evaluation","Mobile handsets","Modulation","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR performance","spectral null coding technique","OFDM system","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems","bit error rate performance","peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","spectral shaping","spectral null codes","narrowband interference","power spectral density","peak-to-average power ratio","bit error rate","wireless communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8506915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Spectral Null Codes on PAPR and BER Performance in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8506915/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197716","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Spectral Null Codes on PAPR and BER Performance in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"Effects-of-shaping-Trollip-5564175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032372S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490494","isNumber":"8506680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490494","xplore-issue":"8506680","articleId":"8506915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8506970,"authors":[{"name":"Zuzanna Krawczyk","affiliation":["Warsaw University of Technology, Warszawa, Poland"],"firstName":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Krawczyk","id":"37085681222"},{"name":"Jacek Starzy\u0144ski","affiliation":["Warsaw University of Technology, Warszawa, Poland"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Starzy\u0144ski","id":"37086496968"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7895-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7896-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8506970","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":754},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bones","Computed tomography","Training","Pelvis","Neural networks","Data models","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bone","computerised tomography","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["YOLO algorithm","detected regions","similar yet different CT data","bone structures","custom data","human pelvic area","CT slices","individual bones recognition","YOLO neural network","bones detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["object detection","YOLO","neural network","CT"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8506970","abstract":"The article focuses on application of You Only Look Once (YOLO) neural network in the process of individual bones recognition, in the set of CT slices of human pelvic area.

The use of encrypted data by malware poses new challenges to network threat detection because adversaries are able to encrypt malicious data to the cloud which pose a threat to receivers of the encrypted data and the cloud service provider. The flow metadata which includes the number of inbound bytes, outbound bytes, inbound packet, outbound packets, source and destination ports and the total duration of the flow in seconds of an encrypted data is used to compute a trapdoor for detecting a malware of an encrypted data. The flow metadata computed is sent to a private agent known as malware analytic provider (MAP) to check whether the trapdoor generated from a 3-way handshake between a client and a server matches to a normal handshake scheme of a specific traffic. If there is a mismatch, the ciphertext is rejected otherwise, ciphertext sent to an outsourced cloud service provider for storage. We refer to our scheme as encrypted traffic analytic using identity based encryption with equality test (ETA-IBEET). Our approach was instantiated using Bilinear map and Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption to define one-way chosen-ciphertext security against a chosen identity attack (OW-ID-CCA).","doi":"10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8507063","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490494/8506680/08507063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8507063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506680","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encrypted Traffic Analytic using Identity Based Encryption with Equality Test for Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Encrypted Traffic Analytic using Identity Based Encryption with Equality Test for Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507063/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197715","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8507063/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encrypted Traffic Analytic using Identity Based Encryption with Equality Test for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"Identity-Based-Alornyo-5572361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061206S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490494","isNumber":"8506680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490494","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8506680","articleId":"8507063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8507089,"authors":[{"name":"Takato Hatanaka","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Course, Gifu College, Motosu, GIFU, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Takato Hatanaka was born in Gifu, Japan, in 1997.

It involves superimposing a high-frequency current with a small constant amplitude, using a high-frequency current control system. This paper shows that robust position sensorless control against inductance variations can be realized using this proposed method.

These challenges include scheduling, load flow analysis, planning and control of electric energy system. To address this problem, accurate models for electric power load forecasting are essential to the operation and planning of utility companies. The study used a data from the Ashanti East and Ashanti West Regions of the Electricity Company of Ghana. The data is a daily peak load for the whole year of 2014, 2015 and the first month of 2016 with a total of 752 samples. In this study three Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) with layered architecture models (RNN-1-10-1, RNN-1-15-1 and RNN-1-20-1) were developed to forecast the peak electricity load. The test results showed that the best model which forecast the peak load well is RNN-1-10-1 with minimum RMSE value.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507092/","accessionNumber":"18197700","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8507092/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Recurrent Neural Network Model in the Analysis of Electricity Load Demand in Ashanti Region of Ghana","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Recurrent Neural Network Model in the Analysis of Electricity Load Demand in Ashanti Region of Ghana","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"application-recurrent-Oduro-Gyimah-557291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062096S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490494","isNumber":"8506680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490494","xplore-issue":"8506680","articleId":"8507092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8507096,"authors":[{"name":"Jagath Sri Lal Senanayaka","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Sciences, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Jagath Sri Lal Senanayaka received the M.

Reliable diagnosis for defects in the critical components such as bearings, gears and stator windings, is important to prevent failures and enhance the system reliability and power availability. Most of existing fault diagnosis methods are based on specific characteristic frequencies to single faults at constant speed operations. Once multiple faults occur in the system, such a method may not detect the faults effectively and may give false alarms. Furthermore, variable speed operations render a challenge of analysing nonstationary signals. In this work, a deep learning-based fault diagnosis method is proposed to detect common faults in the electric powertrains. The proposed method is based on pattern recognition using convolutional neural network to detect effectively not only single faults at constant speed but also multiple faults in variable speed operations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via an in-house experimental setup.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507096/","accessionNumber":"18195832","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8507096/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple Fault Diagnosis of Electric Powertrains Under Variable Speeds Using Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Fault Diagnosis of Electric Powertrains Under Variable Speeds Using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Alexandroupoli, Greece","sourcePdf":"1900-af-004413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05354S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8478646","isNumber":"8506678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8478646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8506678","articleId":"8507096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8507097,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Volpe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, FR, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Giuseppe Volpe received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees with honors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio in 2013 and 2015.

The thermal behaviour of the machine is studied considering the electrical machine involved in a real race drive cycle like Le Mans circuit. The machine losses, during the race, are calculated with electromagnetic simulations, whose results are then used for the thermal study of the machine behaviour, with the aim of optimising its cooling systems.

It provides evidence on the review of relevant literature on available concepts and frameworks regarding SLAs in cloud computing, leveraging some of these frameworks to design and implement the system (SLAnegmos). Negotiations are effective means of establishing quality of service attributes. However, the dynamism of cloud computing has contributed to the low numbers of SLA negotiation hence monitoring frameworks in cloud computing. The management of SLA in cloud computing has proven to be a very daunting task. However, service providers provide text-based SLAs, which gave the service users no choice but to either reject or accept as provided with a click. Furthermore, service providers only offer their monitoring tools to enhance some form of trust, making the service user an extinct actor in the SLA negotiation and monitoring process. Our proposed platform provides a level ground for negotiating and monitoring in cloud service provision thereby eliminating information asymmetry and trust issues that hitherto exist.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490494/8506680/08507131.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","doi":"10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8507131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8507131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506680","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service Level Agreement Negotiation and Monitoring System in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Monitoring","Quality of service","Computer architecture","Tools","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","service providers","SLA negotiation","cloud service provision","service level agreement negotiation","monitoring system","service attributes","SLA","service level agreements","service users"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Service Level Agreement Negotiation and Monitoring System in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8507131/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197719","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Level Agreement Negotiation and Monitoring System in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"Service-level-Edu-yaw-5565513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038695S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490494","isNumber":"8506680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490494","xplore-issue":"8506680","articleId":"8507131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8507140,"authors":[{"name":"Harry Atta-Motte","affiliation":["School of Technology, Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, Accra, Ghana"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Atta-Motte","id":"37086496431"},{"name":"Eric Kuada","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, Accra, Ghana"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Kuada","id":"38547716300"},{"name":"Mark Amo-Boteng","affiliation":["Department of Energy and Env.

There have been a great number of conditions monitoring techniques employed to monitor the wear rate of track shoes of these undercarriages. The most current and more advanced one is the ultrasonic wear indicator. Although this monitoring equipment gives accurate results, the challenge is the involvement of experts that go through vigorous training with voluminous training manual, and spending a lot of time on inspecting the track equipment. To minimize some of these challenges, this paper has proposed an Artificial Intelligent (AI) system that employs Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with track shoe images to predict the wear rate in a safer, efficient and faster manner. The system was developed, trained and evaluated on eight hundred and seventy-six (876) image data set. The results indicates that our system out performs other techniques in terms of efficiency and speed while at the same time eliminating the need of experts.","doi":"10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8507140","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 7th International Conference on Adaptive Science & Technology (ICAST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490494/8506680/08507140.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASTECH.2018.8507140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8506680","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Mining Track Equipment Undercarriage Shoe Life Using Convolution Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507140/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Mining Track Equipment Undercarriage Shoe Life Using Convolution Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8507140/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197710","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Mining Track Equipment Undercarriage Shoe Life Using Convolution Neural Network","confLoc":"Accra, Ghana","sourcePdf":"Optimizing-mining-Atta-motte-5565503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090555S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490494","isNumber":"8506680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490494","xplore-issue":"8506680","articleId":"8507140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8507213,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Results of case study analyzes show that for these three indicators a Pareto-front can be found already for the location of two switches.","doi":"10.1109/ICSES.2018.8507274","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490107/8507267/08507274.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"160","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSES.2018.8507274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8507267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization for Switch Allocation in Radial Power Distribution Grids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization for Switch Allocation in Radial Power Distribution Grids","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18197653","publicationDate":"September 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8507274/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization for Switch Allocation in Radial Power Distribution Grids","confLoc":"Krak\u00f3w, Poland","sourcePdf":"0039Topic3_Paper5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058051S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490107","isNumber":"8507267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490107","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8507267","articleId":"8507274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8507291,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Wielgosz","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Electronics & Telecommunications, AGH-University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Wielgosz","id":"37872519900"},{"name":"Andrzej Skoczen","affiliation":["Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science, AGH-University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skoczen","id":"37272063600"},{"name":"Kazimierz Wiatr","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Electronics & Telecommunications, AGH-University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Wiatr","id":"37373838600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6768-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6767-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6769-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-2465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-4837"}],"articleNumber":"8507291","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"abstract":"Demand for high availability and performance of the LHC accelerator imposes stringent constraints on safety-critical systems handled by Machine Protection and Electrical Integrity Group at CERN. Consequently, unique means and equipment were introduced to monitor and protect superconducting magnets of the LHC. This work intends to ameliorate available algorithms by using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) architectures. The proposed solution is equipped with a series of architecture modifications and optimizations which enable efficient deployment of the RNN model on embedded systems. A set of experiments were conducted which shows that the proposed system outperforms Isolation Forest and OC-SVM (One-Class SVM) algorithms reaching the accuracy of 0.93 for the two-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows for significant reduction of input data stream to few bits which enable low latency response of the module.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8490107/8507267/08507291.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"262","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","doi":"10.1109/ICSES.2018.8507291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSES.2018.8507291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8507267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Looking for a Correct Solution of Anomaly Detection in the LHC Machine Protection System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Superconducting magnets","Large Hadron Collider","Quantization (signal)","Anomaly detection","Training","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","high energy physics instrumentation computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","safety systems","superconducting magnets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superconducting magnets","RNN architectures","RNN model","embedded systems","two-layer LSTM model","anomaly detection","LHC accelerator","safety-critical systems","recurrent neural network","LHC machine protection system","isolation forest algorithm","OC-SVM algorithm","one-class SVM algorithm","Machine Protection and Electrical Integrity Group","CERN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","LSTM","GRU","RNN","quantization","compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Looking for a Correct Solution of Anomaly Detection in the LHC Machine Protection System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8507291/","publicationDate":"September 2018","accessionNumber":"18197669","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Looking for a Correct Solution of Anomaly Detection in the LHC Machine Protection System","confLoc":"Krak\u00f3w, Poland","sourcePdf":"0060Topic5_Paper10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060745S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8490107","isNumber":"8507267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8490107","xplore-issue":"8507267","articleId":"8507291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8507304,"authors":[{"name":"Zbigniew Galias","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Galias","id":"37269458900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6768-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6767-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6769-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-2465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-4837"}],"articleNumber":"8507304","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Mathematical model","Microsoft Windows","Standards","Trajectory","Integrated circuit modeling","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","differential equations","integration","memristors","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["return map approach","memristor","numerical methods","internal state","standard numerical integration methods","electronic circuit simulation","differential equations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memristor","numerical integration methods","return map"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507304","abstract":"In this work, we discuss numerical methods for simulations of circuits containing memristors.

Typically, these vibrations are only very poorly dampened, as the passive restoring force due the permanent magnets is proportional to the axial deflection (rather than to the axial speed). In this paper, a strategy to actively reduce axial vibrations is presented. In addition to reluctance forces for passive stabilisation, axial damping force is generated by modulating the permanent magnetic air-gap field. To model the rotor\u2019s behaviour the equation of motion is set up and analysed. It is shown, that applying field current, which is proportional to the axial velocity, leads to an improved dampening behaviour. Several static and dynamic measurements are conducted to proove the function of the proposed vibration dampening strategy with a bearingless flux-switching slice motor. Finally, also the case without gravitational force is considered, which leads to a different operational behaviour.","doi":"10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507414","startPage":"3632","endPage":"3639","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476150/8502705/08507414.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dampening of Axial Vibrations in a bearingless Flux-Switching Slice Motor by Field Current Regulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Dampening of Axial Vibrations in a bearingless Flux-Switching Slice Motor by Field Current Regulation","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8507414/","accessionNumber":"18195483","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507414/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dampening of Axial Vibrations in a bearingless Flux-Switching Slice Motor by Field Current Regulation","confLoc":"Niigata, Japan","sourcePdf":"24D1-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047046S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476150","isNumber":"8502705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476150","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8502705","articleId":"8507414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEJ Industry Application Society","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":8507418,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroaki Ueta","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Ueta","id":"37086491567"},{"name":"Tomoki Yokoyama","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Yokoyama","id":"37275594700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-405-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-403-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4190-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8507418","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Inverters","Load modeling","Timing","Simulation","Voltage control","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","linear systems","PWM invertors","switching convertors","uninterruptible power supplies","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching frequency","FPGA based hardware controller","PWM pulse","disturbance compensation method","UPS system","power system","output voltage control","multisampling deadbeat control","three phase PWM inverter system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","three phase PWM inverter","deadbeat control","UPS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507418","abstract":"The demand of the UPS system is highly recommended for the power system of the important infrastructure. The precise output voltage control for the load variations are required. In the case of large scale UPSs, the power rating of the inverter becomes several hundred kVA or more, the switching frequency of the inverter is limited under several kHz range. The carrier interval becomes rather large, so the robustness for the load condition is deteriorated. The deadbeat control with disturbance compensation with 1MHz multisampling method for three phase PWM inverter system is proposed. Using FPGA based hardware controller, 1MHz sampling is realized while the carrier interval of the PWM pulse, the robustness for the load variation can be improved compared with the conventional deadbeat control method.

In a first step, the motor geometry is being optimized and the performance characteristics of the designed motor are examined. The motor is then compared to two other designs, which contain permanent magnets either in the rotor or the stator.

The impact of the PLL on the small-signal stability of VSC has recently been revealed, yet its influence on the transient stability of the VSC has seldom been addressed. This paper thus presents a comprehensive analysis on the transient stability effect of the PLL. It points out that the conventional equal-area criterion (EAC), which is used to analyze the transient stability of the synchronous generator (SG), cannot be extended to analyze the PLL effect, even though a dynamic analogy between the PLL and the swing equation of the SG can be found. The phase portrait is thus used in this work, and it shows that the long settling time and a high damping ratio of the PLL can enhance the transient stability of the VSC. Finally, the experimental tests are performed to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507447","publicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476150/8502705/08507447.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502705","startPage":"2673","endPage":"2680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Stability Impact of the Phase-Locked Loop on Grid-Connected Voltage Source Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transient Stability Impact of the Phase-Locked Loop on Grid-Connected Voltage Source Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507447/","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18195180","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8507447/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Stability Impact of the Phase-Locked Loop on Grid-Connected Voltage Source Converters","confLoc":"Niigata, Japan","sourcePdf":"23P4-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07002S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476150","isNumber":"8502705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476150","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8502705","articleId":"8507447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEJ Industry Application Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8507467,"authors":[{"name":"Junrui Liang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Junrui","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085570924"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-405-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-403-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4190-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8507467","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET","Mathematical model","Integrated circuit modeling","Capacitance","Switching circuits","Power electronics","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","MOSFET","power electronics","resonant invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-frequency class-E resonant inverters","extended impedance method","active components","nonlinear parasitic components","high-frequency operation","steady-state searching process","circuit conditions","high-frequency power electronics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507467","abstract":"The extended impedance method (EIM) is an efficient and intuitive tool for the design and analysis of power switching circuits with active components, nonlinear parasitic components, etc., under high-frequency operation.

However, inherent LCL resonance complicates the design of current control or even threatens system stability. Extensive approaches have been proposed to deal with the resonance, among which the active damping (AD) methods realized by the feedback of filter state variables are proved to be effective and robust. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of such AD by utilizing its virtual circuit property is presented. It is found that different filter state variables can be selected to achieve the effective damping functions by emulating proper virtual impedances (VIs). Meanwhile, the connection of the VI with the LCL network is not restricted by the selected state variable but mainly dependent on the applied AD controller, which, in result, enables a thorough investigation of such VI-based AD methods. Consequently, all possible forms of the AD controller to realize different connection types by utilizing different state variables are derived. The optimal selection of the AD controller together with the specific state variable is further analyzed, where the obtained results can be used to guide the design of such AD in practice. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analyses are verified by the experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507532","publicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476150/8502705/08507532.pdf","startPage":"2681","endPage":"2687","doi":"10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Analysis of Virtual Impedance-Based Active Damping for LCL Resonance in Grid-Connected Inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Analysis of Virtual Impedance-Based Active Damping for LCL Resonance in Grid-Connected Inverters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8507532/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18195294","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507532/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Analysis of Virtual Impedance-Based Active Damping for LCL Resonance in Grid-Connected Inverters","confLoc":"Niigata, Japan","sourcePdf":"23P4-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083538S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476150","isNumber":"8502705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476150","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8502705","articleId":"8507532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEJ Industry Application Society","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8507613,"authors":[{"name":"Hirofumi Akagi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Akagi","id":"37271018200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-405-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-403-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4190-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8507613","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Pulse width modulation","Bridge circuits","Automatic voltage control","Modular multilevel converters","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical systems","HVDC power convertors","PWM power convertors","voltage-source convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel cascade converters","phase-shifted-carrier PWM","multilevel converters","inter-arm balancing control","inter-cluster balancing","hierarchical control system","chopper-cell count","bridge-cell count"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circulating currents","grid-tied applications","hierarchical control","modular multilevel cascade converters","and pulsewidth modulation (PWM)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What Led to Success in Academic Research on the Family of Modular Multilevel Cascade Converters?","doi":"10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502705","endPage":"2359","publicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476150/8502705/08507613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507613","startPage":"2352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507613","abstract":"This paper provides a comprehensive discussion on the topology and terminology of the family of modular multilevel cascade converters, including their chronological review.

The circuit operating principle is based on current unfolding and injection method, which is similar to that of a SWISS rectifier. This approach requires only two high frequency switches operating at only half voltage stress, thus leading to a significant reduction in switching losses. Other switches only operate at line frequency, and therefore can be optimized to reduce conduction losses. The proposed inverter therefore can deliver high efficiency. This paper discusses the basic operating principle as well as control method for the inverter. It is revealed that the output currents of the proposed inverter contains intrinsic oscillation due to current unfolding operation. In order to solve this problem, an active damping method is proposed to stabilize the operation. As a result, stable operation of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation. The feasibility of the proposed inverter is also confirmed using a mini laboratory prototype.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Switches","Damping","Oscillators","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","invertors","power grids","solar power stations","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase grid","integrated boost function","current unfolding injection method","SWISS rectifier","high frequency switches","half voltage stress","switching losses","line frequency","conduction losses","boost integrated three-phase solar inverter","current unfolding damping methods","active damping methods","intrinsic oscillation"]}],"doi":"10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507806","publicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476150/8502705/08507806.pdf","startPage":"1414","endPage":"1420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boost Integrated Three-Phase Solar Inverter using Current Unfolding and Active Damping Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8507806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Boost Integrated Three-Phase Solar Inverter using Current Unfolding and Active Damping Methods","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507806/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8507806/","accessionNumber":"18195151","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boost Integrated Three-Phase Solar Inverter using Current Unfolding and Active Damping Methods","confLoc":"Niigata, Japan","sourcePdf":"22P18-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057381S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476150","isNumber":"8502705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476150","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8502705","articleId":"8507806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEJ Industry Application Society","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8507824,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Chen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Ilan University, Yilan, Taiwan, R.

GaN devices are used both as primary and secondary switches to reduce the converter volume and switching losses, to achieve high power density. The planar transformer design reduces the conduction losses and current stresses of the secondary switches attributed to the winding configuration.

Then, we applied the obtained design guidelines to a typical motor and confirmed the reduction of the eddy current loss in the stator at high speed.","doi":"10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507953","publicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference (IPEC-Niigata 2018 -ECCE Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476150/8502705/08507953.pdf","startPage":"704","endPage":"710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Influence of Difference in Structure of Concentrated Winding IPMSMs Obtained by Automatic Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8507953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Study on Influence of Difference in Structure of Concentrated Winding IPMSMs Obtained by Automatic Design","htmlLink":"/document/8507953/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"18195065","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on Influence of Difference in Structure of Concentrated Winding IPMSMs Obtained by Automatic Design","confLoc":"Niigata, Japan","sourcePdf":"22D1-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064101S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476150","isNumber":"8502705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476150","xplore-issue":"8502705","articleId":"8507953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEJ Industry Application Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8508003,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Liu","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085739064"},{"name":"Yushi Miura","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Yushi","lastName":"Miura","id":"37402719700"},{"name":"Toshifumi Ise","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshifumi","lastName":"Ise","id":"37273766600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-405-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-403-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4190-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8508003","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8508003","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Inverters","Transient analysis","Phase locked loops","Synchronous generators","Oscillators","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","distributed power generation","invertors","oscillations","pole assignment","power generation control","state feedback","state-space methods","synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual synchronous generator control","inverter control scheme","virtual inertia","transient oscillation damping","state-space model","damping effect","pole placement","state feedback control","VSG control","inverter-interfaced distributed generators","infinite bus","PSCAD/EMTDC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed generator","virtual synchronous generator","oscillation damping","state feedback control"]}],"abstract":"Recent years, in order to avoid probable inertia decrease of power system due to increasing inverter-interfaced distributed generators, virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control, an inverter control scheme providing virtual inertia, has been proposed.

Spin orbit torque driven domain wall based devices that act as synapse have been shown to be much more energy efficient than CMOS devices that implement neural networks [2], [4]. Here, we have considered the role of defects in ferromagnetic layer and thereby proposed a spin orbit torque driven skyrmionic device, which consumes even lower energy compared to domain wall based device for synaptic behavior. We perform micromagnetic simulations on mumax3 [5]to demonstrate motion of Neel skyrmion and transverse Neel domain wall in a ferromagnet layer of thickness 1 nm, driven by spin orbit torque from current flowing through layer of heavy metal (Pt, spin Hall angle = 0.07) underneath [6, 8, 9]. We observe (as shown in Fig. 1a)that in the presence of triangular notch defects of 6 nm depth and modified anisotropy 1.2 MJ/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n (the magnet has uniform perpendicular anisotropy of 0.8 MJ/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n elsewhere) on the two edges of the magnet at a separation of 60 nm each, domain wall is pinned up to a current density of 24 MA/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n through the heavy metal. But a skyrmion is depinned by current density as low as 1 MA/ cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n though its velocity at such small current density is also very small [6], [7]. Based on this result, we propose a skyrmionic device as shown in Fig. 1b, which can act as a synapse. A Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) structure is present at the right end of the device. Based on magnitude and duration of current pulse through heavy metal layer (applied between terminal T3 and T1) certain number of skyrmions moves to the region of the ferromagnet below the MTJ. Hence Tunneling Magneto-Resistance of MTJ measured between terminal T2 and T1 is a function of the current between T3 and T1 and corresponds to the weight of the synapse, which can be controlled by the current and stored subsequently since skyrmions won't move once current pulse is removed just like domain walls (Fig. 1b). The resistance vs current behavior of the skyrmionic synapse (Fig. 1c), obtained through micromagnetic simulations, shows that in the presence of defects a very small range of current (3.5 \u03bcA to 6.5 \u03bcA) can modulate the resistance from its lowest to highest value, corresponding to weight of synapse varying from -1 to 1. On the other hand a much larger range of current (- 300 \u03bcA to 380 \u03bcA) is needed to do the same for domain wall based synapse proposed in Ref. 4 if defects are present. Next we solve the standard digit recognition problem (Fig. 2b)by simulating a feedforward neural network with backpropagation algorithm [10](Fig. 2a)using the domain wall device (Ref. 4) or skyrmion based device (Fig. 1b)as synapses. A three layer feedforward network is trained to identify digits 0-4 across 10 computer generated variations for each digit, that mimic variations due to different handwriting. 35,000 iterations are needed to train the network and total number of synapses is 425. Error generated at the output layer after every iteration needs to be used to change the weights of all the synapses for subsequent iteration through the back-propagation algorithm. This is implemented by passing currents proportional to the generated error through the heavy metal layer of the synaptic devices (between terminal T3 and T1) and move the domain wall/ skyrmion to change the resistance of the MTJ (between T2 and T1) and thus change the weight value of the synapse.The energy dissipation due to this current flow in the heavy metal layer is called the \u201cwrite\u201d energy consumption, which is the most dominant energy contribution in the system. Fig. 2cis our key result which compares the total \u201cwrite\u201d energy consumption to train the network with synaptic devices being of the following four types: i. domain wall without defect (write current pulse width: 1 ns) ii. Skyrmion without defect (write pulse width: 15 ns) iii. Domain wall with defect (write pulse width: 0.5 ns) iv. Skyrmion with defect (write pulse width: 550 ns). We see that in the absence of defect, domain wall synapses consume less energy than skyrmion based synapses because domain wall moves faster than skyrmion for a given current density (Fig. 1a). But in presence of defects, since domain wall is pinned till current density of ~24 MA/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n while skyrmions do not get pinned at current density even much smaller than that, if we \u201cwrite\u201d the skyrmion synapses with current pulses of very long duration (\u2265 500 ns) and very small magnitude (3- 6 \u03bcA) the skyrmion synapse based network can be trained at 2 orders of magnitude lower energy consumption than domain wall synapse based network. Thus in this paper we propose and simulate a skyrmion based synaptic device and show it to be much more energy efficient than domain wall based device. It will be particularly suitable for solving problems where time is not a major constraint.","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508069","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484958/8508031/08508069.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low energy implementation of feedforward neural network with backpropagation algorithm using a spin orbit torque driven skyrmionic device.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetics","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","current density","electronic engineering computing","feedforward neural nets","ferromagnetic materials","iterative methods","magnetic anisotropy","magnetic domain walls","magnetic tunnelling","micromagnetics","skyrmions","tunnelling magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spin orbit torque driven domain wall","energy efficient","ferromagnetic layer","transverse Neel domain wall","heavy metal layer","skyrmion synapse based network","domain wall synapse based network","energy consumption","standard digit recognition problem","tunneling magnetoresistance","MTJ structure","magnetic tunnel junction structure","uniform perpendicular anisotropy","transverse Neel domain","Neel skyrmion","mumax3","micromagnetic simulations","spin orbit torque driven skyrmionic device","CMOS devices","ANN","artificial neural networks","spintronic devices","three layer feedforward neural network","backpropagation algorithm","domain wall device synapses","current density","current 3.5 muA to 6.5 muA","time 0.5 ns","size 1 nm","distance 60 nm","current -300 muA to 380 muA","time 1 ns","time 15 ns","time 550 ns","current 3 muA to 6 muA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Low energy implementation of feedforward neural network with backpropagation algorithm using a spin orbit torque driven skyrmionic device.","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8508069/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"23-27 April 2018","accessionNumber":"18203845","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low energy implementation of feedforward neural network with backpropagation algorithm using a spin orbit torque driven skyrmionic device.","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"DD02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125605S","chronDate":"23-27 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484958","isNumber":"8508031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484958","xplore-issue":"8508031","articleId":"8508069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8508083,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, STT-MRAM suffers from tunnel barrier degradation under rapid operations and a poor spin polarization. In contrast, spin-orbit torque MRAM (SOT-MRAM) utilizes spin-orbit interaction at the interface of heavy metal (HM) and ferromagnetic (FM) layers via mechanisms such as the Rashba effect and spin Hall effect (SHE\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1 2</sup>\n. Since current only flows through the heavy metal in SOT-MRAM, device performance is no longer limited by insulator breakdown. Because no charge current through the FM layer is needed in SOT devices, the other unrecognized benefit of SOT is its compatibility with low-damping magnetic insulators (MI). SOT experiments with YIG/Pt, YIG/Ta, and YIG/W have demonstrated the potential for ultra-low damped switching of YIG in SOT systems\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3 4</sup>\n.

In these systems, based on different feature representations, various kinds of classifiers are constructed to detect Android malware. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we first extract a set of features from the Android applications (apps) and represent them as binary feature vectors; with these inputs, we then explore the security of a generic learning-based classifier for Android malware detection in the presence of adversaries. To harden the evasion, we first present count featurization to transform the binary feature space into continuous probabilities encoding the distribution in each class (either benign or malicious). To improve the system security while not compromising the detection accuracy, we further introduce softmax function with adversarial parameter to find the best trade-off between security and accuracy for the classifier. Accordingly, we develop a system named DroidEye which integrates our proposed method for Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on the real sample collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DroidEye against adversarial Android malware attacks. Our proposed secure-learning paradigm is also applicable for other detection tasks, such as spammer detection in social media.","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508284","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488381/8508239/08508284.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DroidEye: Fortifying Security of Learning-Based Classifier Against Adversarial Android Malware Attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"DroidEye: Fortifying Security of Learning-Based Classifier Against Adversarial Android Malware Attacks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"August 2018","accessionNumber":"18197012","htmlLink":"/document/8508284/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DroidEye: Fortifying Security of Learning-Based Classifier Against Adversarial Android Malware Attacks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"139_0782_136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07401S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488381","isNumber":"8508239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488381","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8508239","articleId":"8508284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8508304,"authors":[{"name":"Jacek Skryzalin","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Skryzalin","id":"37086496766"},{"name":"Hamilton Link","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories"],"firstName":"Hamilton","lastName":"Link","id":"37086494478"},{"name":"Jeremy Wendt","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Wendt","id":"37411617800"},{"name":"Richard Field","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Field","id":"37375806800"},{"name":"Samuel N.

Unfortunately, the complexity of ECCs will be increased as the code length increases. Nowadays, the magnetic recording (MR) system takes advantage of powerful ECCs by using 4 Kbytes sector. Among the advanced ECCs, the spatially coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes (also known as a LDPC convolutional code) [1]are shown to have the decoding latency and complexity lower than those of the underlying LDPC block codes (LDPC-BC). Moreover, the SC-LDPC codes with threshold decoding outperform the LDPC-BC codes [2]. Hence, the SC-LDPC codes are the strong candidate for the future MR systems, when the sector size is increased beyond 4 Kbytes. An SC-LDPC decoder can use sliding window decoding [3]whereby the received signals are decoded by sliding window along the bit sequence. The window decoder is called \u201cuniform window decoding (U-WD),\u201d when all variable nodes (VNs) within a window are updated. In order to reduce the complexity of window decoding, some researchers proposed the non-uniform window decoding (N-WD) [4], which do not update the VNs with no improvement in the bit error rate (BER). This approach provides about 35-50% reduction in complexity compared to U-WD. In this work, we consider the application of SC-LDPC codes in MR systems, whereby SC-LDPC decoder cooperates with BCJR detector to encounter inter-symbol interference (ISI). We propose the dynamic shifting of window decoding (DS-WD) to reduce the complexity of SC-LDPC codes. Herein, the number of shifted bits is defined according to their soft BERs which are estimated at each decoding position. In addition, we modify the N-WD [4]to reinforce our proposed algorithm called \u201cdynamic-shifting non-uniform window decoding (DS-N-WD).\u201d The DS-WD and DS-N-WD achieve the complexity reduction of 7% and 25% without any loss in performance compared to the N-WD algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508405","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484958/8508031/08508405.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-complexity window decoding of spatially coupled LDPC codes for magnetic recording systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-complexity window decoding of spatially coupled LDPC codes for magnetic recording systems.","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8508405/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18196376","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508405/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-complexity window decoding of spatially coupled LDPC codes for magnetic recording systems.","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"HV06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069077S","chronDate":"23-27 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484958","isNumber":"8508031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484958","xplore-issue":"8508031","articleId":"8508405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8508411,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Using a rich dataset with 23 million tweets, 115 thousand user profiles and their contact network collected from January 2016 to November 2016, we identified four politically engaged user groups: advocates for both main candidates, political bots, and regular users. We present a characterization of how Twitter users behave during a political campaign through the language patterns analysis of tweets, which users receive more popularity during the campaign and how tweets from each candidate may have affected their mood variation, as expressed by the messages they share.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8508459/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197053","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing Politically Engaged Users' Behavior During the 2016 US Presidential Campaign","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing Politically Engaged Users' Behavior During the 2016 US Presidential Campaign","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"085_0523_022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068289S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488381","isNumber":"8508239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488381","xplore-issue":"8508239","articleId":"8508459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8508464,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Moreover, we extend this approach to construct SC codes with \u03b3=4. The memory m of an SC code plays the critical role on its performance over channels with SNR variation. By increasing memory, sections are more cooperative, and the SNR variation among them can be alleviated better. The parameter m determines how many different sections are involved in the check equations in an iterative decoding. Because of our SC code construction, most CNs receive messages from VNs within m+1 consecutive sections. As a result, if there is one reliable section with a high SNR, it can in principle help the messages from other m sections be recovered more reliably. For interleaving, we divide the SC codeword into L\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n/(m+1) chunks. Then, we rearrange them by taking one chunk from each L consecutive chunks and putting them next to each other. This interleaved data is passed through the channel, and the de-interleaving is performed on the received data from the channel and before decoding. Due to interleaving, most CN receives an equal number of messages from all L different levels of reliabilities.","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508464","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484958/8508031/08508464.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially-Coupled Codes for Channels With SNR Variation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508464/","conferenceDate":"23-27 April 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Spatially-Coupled Codes for Channels With SNR Variation.","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18196446","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8508464/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially-Coupled Codes for Channels With SNR Variation.","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"GI04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049257S","chronDate":"23-27 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484958","isNumber":"8508031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484958","xplore-issue":"8508031","articleId":"8508464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8508475,"authors":[{"name":"Abhinav Maurya","affiliation":["Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Maurya","id":"37086146028"},{"name":"Mark Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37086497109"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6051-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6052-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-991X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-9928"}],"articleNumber":"8508475","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"abstract":"Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are probabilistic tools of choice for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables in complex networked systems such as social networks, sensor networks, financial markets, etc. Finding changepoints in the structural evolution of a GGM is therefore essential to detecting anomalies in the underlying system modeled by the GGM. In order to detect structural anomalies in a GGM, we consider the problem of estimating changes in the precision matrix of the corresponding multivariate Gaussian distribution. We take a two-step approach to solving this problem:- (i) estimating a background precision matrix using system observations from the past without any anomalies, and (ii) estimating a foreground precision matrix using a sliding temporal window during anomaly monitoring. Our primary contribution is in estimating the foreground precision using a novel contrastive inverse covariance estimation procedure. In order to accurately learn only the structural changes to the GGM, we maximize a penalized log-likelihood where the penalty is the l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n norm of difference between the foreground precision being estimated and the already learned background precision. We suitably modify the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for sparse inverse covariance estimation to perform contrastive estimation of the foreground precision matrix. Our results on simulated GGM data show significant improvement in precision and recall for detecting structural changes to the GGM, compared to a non-contrastive sliding window baseline.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488381/8508239/08508475.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"739","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8508475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contrastive Structured Anomaly Detection for Gaussian Graphical Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphical models","Image edge detection","Covariance matrices","Sparse matrices","Anomaly detection","Optimization","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance analysis","covariance matrices","Gaussian distribution","Gaussian processes","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contrastive structured anomaly detection","Gaussian graphical models","conditional dependencies","complex networked systems","social networks","sensor networks","financial markets","structural evolution","structural anomalies","background precision matrix","foreground precision matrix","sliding temporal window","anomaly monitoring","structural changes","learned background precision","sparse inverse covariance estimation","contrastive estimation","simulated GGM data","noncontrastive sliding window baseline","multivariate Gaussian distribution","contrastive inverse covariance estimation procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Contrastive Structured Anomaly Detection for Gaussian Graphical Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8508475/","publicationDate":"August 2018","accessionNumber":"18196953","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contrastive Structured Anomaly Detection for Gaussian Graphical Models","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"130_0736_088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049292S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488381","isNumber":"8508239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488381","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8508239","articleId":"8508475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8508487,"authors":[{"name":"Susan El-Naggar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, USA"],"firstName":"Susan","lastName":"El-Naggar","id":"37085743893"},{"name":"Ayman Abaza","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Abaza","id":"37394890800"},{"name":"Thirimachos Bourlai","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, USA"],"firstName":"Thirimachos","lastName":"Bourlai","id":"37269166000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6051-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6052-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-991X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-9928"}],"articleNumber":"8508487","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8508487","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ear","Face","Proposals","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","convolution","ear","face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","image recognition","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Faster R-CNN","ear recognition algorithmic process","superior detection performance","face detection","ear detection system","illumination","ear occlusion","faster region-based convolutional neural network","detection rate","ear datasets","AlexNet model","region proposal network","RPN","nonear segment classification","ear segment classification","image quality"]}],"abstract":"Ear recognition has its advantages in identifying non-cooperative individuals in unconstrained environments. Ear detection is a major step within the ear recognition algorithmic process. While conventional approaches for ear detection have been used in the past, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) based detection methods have recently achieved superior detection performance in various benchmark studies, including those on face detection. In this work, we propose an ear detection system that uses Faster R-CNN. The training of the system is performed on two stages: First, an AlexNet model is trained for classifying ear vs. non-ear segments. Second, the unified Region Proposal Network (RPN) with the AlexNet, that shares the convolutional features, are trained for ear detection. The proposed system operates in real-time and accomplishes 98 % detection rate on a test set, composed of data coming from different ear datasets. In addition, the system's ear detection performance is high even when the test images are coming from un-controlled settings with a wide variety of images in terms of image quality, illumination and ear occlusion.","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8488381/8508239/08508487.pdf","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508487","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ear Detection in the Wild Using Faster R-CNN Deep Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ear Detection in the Wild Using Faster R-CNN Deep Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508487/","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8508487/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"August 2018","accessionNumber":"18197082","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ear Detection in the Wild Using Faster R-CNN Deep Learning","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"193_1124_174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081677S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488381","isNumber":"8508239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488381","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8508239","articleId":"8508487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":8508564,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, this powerful communication platform has come under scrutiny for allowing hostile actors to exploit online discussions in an attempt to manipulate public opinion. A case in point is the ongoing U.S. Congress investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, with Russia accused of, among other things, using trolls (malicious accounts created for the purpose of manipulation) and bots (automated accounts) to spread misinformation and politically biased information. In this study, we explore the effects of this manipulation campaign, taking a closer look at users who re-shared the posts produced on Twitter by the Russian troll accounts publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress investigation. We collected a dataset with over 43 million elections-related posts shared on Twitter between September 16 and November 9, 2016 by about 5.7 million distinct users. This dataset includes accounts associated with the identified Russian trolls. We use label propagation to infer the users' ideology based on the news sources they shared, to classify a large number of them as liberal or conservative with precision and recall above 90%. Conservatives retweeted Russian trolls significantly more often than liberals and produced 36 times more tweets. Additionally, most of the troll content originated in, and was shared by users from Southern states. Using state-of-the-art bot detection techniques, we estimated that about 4.9% and 6.2% of liberal and conservative users respectively were bots. Text analysis on the content shared by trolls reveals that they had a mostly conservative, pro-Trump agenda. Although an ideologically broad swath of Twitter users were exposed to Russian trolls in the period leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, it was mainly conservatives who helped amplify their message.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8508646/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18197019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the Digital Traces of Political Manipulation: The 2016 Russian Interference Twitter Campaign","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the Digital Traces of Political Manipulation: The 2016 Russian Interference Twitter Campaign","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"042_0258_054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085104S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8488381","isNumber":"8508239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8488381","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8508239","articleId":"8508646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8508681,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In the first-step optimization, the multiobjective design of adopted altered bee colony optimization (BCO) and Taguchi method combined with finite element analysis (FEA) are used for optimizing the barrier shape and layer number in the rotor to reduce torque ripple and raise power factor. In the second-step optimization, the adopted multiobject design method can be emplyed for optimizing the geometry of stator to achieve minimum cost and maximum efficiency. Experimental results show that these techniques can not only improve the efficiency and power factor but also reduce the material cost and torque ripple. The multiphase machine offers numerous advantages over the conventional threephase motor drives such as increased torque per ampere for the same volume machine, reduction of the stator current per phase, improvement of torque density and increase of the fault tolerance [1-2]. Some of the most suitable applications are electric, hybrid electric vehicles [3] and ship propulsion [4]. An multiobjective optimization design of a six-phase synchronous reluctance motor applied in a centrifugal compressor provides an important role in helping the consumption systems. The factors of design optimization in the six-phase synchronous reluctance motor are minimizing material cost, minimizing torque ripple, maximizing efficiency, and maximizing power factor. One of the popular design methods of the electromagnetic devices is the use of finite-element analysis (FEA) coupled with optimization algorithms. However, the classical optimization algorithms, such as deterministic and stochastic methods, seem to be not very efficient by using the FEA because it needs longer computing time. Therefore, a multiobjective optimization design of a six-phase synchronous reluctance motor used in both the altered bee colony optimization (BCO) [5], [6] and the Taguchi method [7], [8] with FEA [9], [10] in practical methodology is applied in a centrifugal compressor system. In this paper, the motor is rated at a power of 3kW, rotating at 1800r/min. The initial design of the motor consists of a stator having 36 slots that carry two-layer windings, as shown in Fig. 1 and Table I. The losses of the motor include iron loss in the stator, copper loss in the winding, eddy current loss in the rotor, and rotational losses due to friction and wind resistance. The iron and copper losses were the dominant contributor in a centrifugal compressor. The finite-element method with the measurement that combined the BCO and the Taguchi method is a very efficient and effective approach in the robust design of a high-performance motor. This paper presents the optimization design of a six-phase synchronous reluctance motor using two-stage optimization processes, which mainly depends on the stator and rotor regions between cost and efficiency. The stator region is applied to reduce the use of the iron and the winding to minimize cost and maxmimize efficiency in the first stage, while the rotor parameters are kept unchanged. An optimization design based on the altered BCO and the Taguchi method with FEA is employed to further enhance the machine performance. The Taguchi method can optimize the machine parameter of performance characteristics in electrical discharge machining. The experimental results are then converted into a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The S/N ratio can be used to measure the deviation of the show characteristics from the desired values. In the second-stage optimization, the objectives are the maximization of power factor and minimization of toque ripple. while the stator parameters are kept unchanged. An optimization design based on the altered BCO and the Taguchi method with FEA is employed to further enhance the machine performance. In summary, it is seen that the two-stage optimization can reduce both cost and torque ripple, and further increase efficiency and power factor from the experimental values. Finally, the photo view of a six-phase synchronous reluctance motor is shown Fig. 2. The views of stator, rotor and winding combination in the six-phase synchronous reluctance motor mounted with a centrifugal compressor is shown in Fig. 2(a)-(b). This paper has presented an optimization design using the altered BCO and Taguchi method with FEA for tacking multiobjective optimization problems on a six-phase synchronous reluctance motor mounted with a centrifugal compressor compressor. The results of this paper confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique for obtaining lower cost and better performance characteristics. This technique can be applied to solve multiobjective optimization problems of any electromagnetic devices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design for an Six-Phase Synchronous Reluctance Motor Mounted With Centrifugal Compressor Using Multiobjective Optimization Methods.","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508681","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484958/8508031/08508681.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508031","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8508681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Design for an Six-Phase Synchronous Reluctance Motor Mounted With Centrifugal Compressor Using Multiobjective Optimization Methods.","conferenceDate":"23-27 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8508681/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18196665","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design for an Six-Phase Synchronous Reluctance Motor Mounted With Centrifugal Compressor Using Multiobjective Optimization Methods.","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"AU14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037407S","chronDate":"23-27 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484958","isNumber":"8508031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484958","xplore-issue":"8508031","articleId":"8508681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8508685,"authors":[{"name":"H.

To storage synaptic weights, the SRAM is traditionally utilized in the CMOS based ASIC designs for hardware acceleration implementation of DNNs. However, it has been proved to be extremely area- and power-inefficiency due to its large cell area ( >200 F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) and volatility, respectively. To overcome these issues, the emerging non-volatile spin transfer torque magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM) with small cell area (<; 10 F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) recently has been proposed to implement synaptic weights instead of SRAM [2]. Moreover, STT-MRAM has been demonstrated at Gb chip-level by industry [3]. In this paper, a single-layer binary perceptron (BP) is proposed for image recognition, which can be implemented via the pseudo-crossbar array of 1T-1MTJ (STT-MRAM cell) as shown in Fig. 1(a). With the learning rule in [1], such BP was trained in an off-line manner on a set of N = 30 patterns, including three stylized letters (`z', `v', `n') as shown in Fig. 1(b) [4], which also was used for testing. To classify these three stylized letters, we design a winner-takes-all (WTA) circuit as shown in Fig. 1(c), which is used as the peripheral inference circuit of proposed BP. Based on a physics-based STT-MTJ compact model and a commercial CMOS 40 nm design kit, the functionality of the proposed BP and WTA circuit have been demonstrated as shown in Fig. 2(a). Additionally, we also investigate the impact of TMR and device variations on the recognition rate as shown in Fig. 2(b)and Fig. 2(c), respectively. In summary, a STT-MRAM based binary synaptic array with a WTA circuit has been proposed for image recognition, which provides a promising solution for hardware implementation of BNNs on-chip.","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508744","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484958/8508031/08508744.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit-level Design and Evaluation of STT-MRAM based Binary Winner-Takes-All Network for Image Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Circuit-level Design and Evaluation of STT-MRAM based Binary Winner-Takes-All Network for Image Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8508744/","accessionNumber":"18196347","publicationDate":"April 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit-level Design and Evaluation of STT-MRAM based Binary Winner-Takes-All Network for Image Recognition","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"DD03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125978S","chronDate":"23-27 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484958","isNumber":"8508031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484958","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8508031","articleId":"8508744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8508763,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Salehi Rizi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Fatemeh Salehi","lastName":"Rizi","id":"37071189100"},{"name":"Joerg Schloetterer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Schloetterer","id":"37086490494"},{"name":"Michael Granitzer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Granitzer","id":"37394939100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6051-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6052-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-991X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2473-9928"}],"articleNumber":"8508763","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Facebook","Blogs","Feedforward neural networks","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","feedforward neural nets","graph theory","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shortest path distance approximation","deep learning techniques","shortest path distances","graph algorithms","approximation methods","scalable graph processing","vector embeddings","feedforward neural network","breadth-first-search method","BFS method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shortest Path Distance","Deep Learning","Graph Embedding"]}],"abstract":"Computing shortest path distances between nodes lies at the heart of many graph algorithms and applications.

However, STT-MRAM suffers from process variations and thermal fluctuations, leading to both the write errors and read errors [2]. Hence it is critical to construct effective error correction codes (ECCs) to improve the system reliability. A single-error-correcting (71, 64) Hamming code is adopted by Everspin's 16Mb MRAM [3]. Extended Hamming codes with hybrid decoding are further proposed for STT-MRAM for the purpose of replacing DRAM [2]. Multiple-error-correcting BCH codes as well as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have also been investigated for STT-MRAM [4], for applications with relaxed requirement of the read latency. In this work, we propose, for the first time, the design and optimization of polar codes [5] for the STT-MRAM channel. Compared with LDPC codes with short code lengths, polar codes can achieve better error performance with lower decoding complexity. Moreover, polar codes allow easy adjustment of the code rates with a single encoder/decoder, which is a significant advantage over the Hamming codes and BCH codes. Such rate-compatible property can mitigate the raw bit error rate (BER) diversity of STT-MRAM cells caused by process variations.","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508795","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484958/8508031/08508795.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar Coding for Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508795/","conferenceDate":"23-27 April 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Polar Coding for Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM).","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18196661","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8508795/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar Coding for Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM).","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"HC09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045531S","chronDate":"23-27 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484958","isNumber":"8508031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484958","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8508031","articleId":"8508795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8508858,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In information and communication technology (ICT) equipment indispensable for modern society, semiconductor memories occupy the main position of storage memories, working memories, and e-memories in logic blocks. In current semiconductor memories, rapid increase in the power consumption is most serious issue, as the more energy-saving is strongly required for ICT technology. From above view point, STT-MRAM and its application such as NV-Logic are aggressively studied in the world and many excellent results were published. However, almost results of STT-MRAM were fabricated by ion beam etch (IBE) process. Therefore, for higher density STT-MRAM's mass-production under wide patterning process margin and high TAT, plasma based reactive ion etch (RIE) process technology for MTJs is needed. In this invited paper, it is reviewed our previas results regarding STT-MRAM and NV-Logic fabricated by RIE process as shown in Fig. 1. It is shown that STT-MRAM and NV-MCU etc. were successfully worked under extremely low power consumption. Moreover, it is reviewed our previas results of RIE process technology itself. We presented process and device results from a developed chemistry set which significantly reduces the etch damage compared with conventional chemistry. An etched MTJ stack profile is included in Fig. 2. The damage caused by RIE on the magnetic properties of the CoFeB free layer in a MTJ with a perpendicular easy axis (p-MTJ), and on the TMR ratio of CoFeB-MgO p-MTJs was characterized to identify its root cause. Fig. 3 includes TMR data from a selection of different chemistry sets. Our developed chemistry is based on learning that it is N and H radicals that are the primary source of damage. With our developed process, high TMR ratio was achieved with very slight degradation. We report our chemistry, its underlying concept, resultant MTJ profiles, device electrical and magnetic properties. Finally, we summarize the MTJ damage mechanism useful for bringing MTJ fabrication etch technology to maturity.","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508858","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8484958/8508031/08508858.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8508031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Etch Process Technology for High Density STT-MRAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8508858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Etch Process Technology for High Density STT-MRAM.","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"18196459","htmlLink":"/document/8508858/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","conferenceDate":"23-27 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Etch Process Technology for High Density STT-MRAM.","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"HC04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074535S","chronDate":"23-27 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8484958","isNumber":"8508031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8484958","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8508031","articleId":"8508858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8508928,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan T.

One of the important concept of cloud computing is virtualization that plays a vital role to maximize resource usage among large number of users. To efficiently utilize the resources in a virtualized environment; they need to be over committed. Over commitment is the process of allocating more resources to a virtual machine that is physically present on the host. It is based on the principle that the majority of the Virtual Machines will use only a small percentage of the resources allocated to them at a given time. With the virtualization it becomes possible to use all different resources in shared manner and at same time by different time. There are lots of techniques now days are available to make the cloud system to be work more efficiently.

In the proposed scheme of implementing concurrent architecture for scheduling different task, two concurrent scheduling is observed through round robin technique and the prioritized services are executed. The implementation of the architecture using Field Programmable Gate Array greatly optimizes the constraints like Power, Time, Area and Hardware Resource Utilization and etc. It is proven for development of Efficient and Secured Templates. To demonstrate the performance of the system, traffic light system is implemented considering emergency traffic handling, density based traffic handling and routine traffic handling.

The basic idea of PLS is to exploit the characteristics of the wireless channel and its impairments including noise, fading, interference, dispersion, diversity, etc. in order to ensure the ability of the intended user to successfully perform data decoding while preventing eavesdroppers from doing so. Thus, the main design goal of PLS is to increase the performance difference between the link of the legitimate receiver and that of the eavesdropper by using well-designed transmission schemes. In this survey, we propose a conceptual, generic, and expandable framework for classifying the existing PLS techniques against wireless passive eavesdropping. In this flexible framework, the security techniques that we comprehensively review in this treatise are divided into two primary approaches: signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio-based approach and complexity-based approach. The first approach is classified into three major categories: first, secrecy channel codes-based schemes; second, security techniques based on channel adaptation; third, schemes based on injecting interfering artificial (noise/jamming) signals along with the transmitted information signals. The second approach (complexity-based), which is associated with the mechanisms of extracting secret sequences from the shared channel, is classified into two main categories based on which layer the secret sequence obtained by channel quantization is applied on. The techniques belonging to each one of these categories are divided and classified into three main signal domains: time, frequency and space. For each one of these domains, several examples are given and illustrated along with the review of the state-of-the-art security advances in each domain. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach alongside the lessons learned from existing research works are stated and discussed. The recent applications of PLS techniques to different emerging communication systems such as visible light communication, body area network, power line communication, Internet of Things, smart grid, mm-Wave, cognitive radio, vehicular ad-hoc network, unmanned aerial vehicle, ultra-wideband, device-to-device, radio-frequency identification, index modulation, and 5G non-orthogonal multiple access based-systems, are also reviewed and discussed. The paper is concluded with recommendations and future research directions for designing robust, efficient and strong security methods for current and future wireless systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2019","volume":"21","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2019","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8509094/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Classifications and Applications of Physical Layer Security Techniques for Confidentiality: A Comprehensive Survey","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)","grantNumber":"114E244"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifications and Applications of Physical Layer Security Techniques for Confidentiality: A Comprehensive Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-hamamreh-2878035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.650473S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8727625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"8727625","articleId":"8509094","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509105,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmood Alam","affiliation":["National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8509105/alam-2877477-small.gif","p":["Mehmood Alam received the B.E. and master\u2019s degrees in communication systems engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

Exploiting the sporadic node activity of the massive machine-type communication, CSMUD recovers the signal from far fewer linear measurements than the number of users, thereby facilitating massive connectivity. However, with the increase in the number of sensor nodes, the errors in the activity detection also increase. In this paper, we propose sequence block-based compressed sensing multiuser detection (SB-CSMUD), which enhances the activity detection by using block of multiple spreading sequences as signature of the node. It is demonstrated both empirically and theoretically that the SB-CSMUD scheme besides improving the detection error rate also increases the spectrum efficiency. Simulation results show that for the same least square estimation error rate (LSER), SB-CSMUD not only reduces the bandwidth by 10% but also reduces the bit error rate by more than 1.5 order of magnitude at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 dB. The bandwidth can even be reduced by 25%-30% at SNR > 20 dB for achieving the same detection error rate at the cost of LSER. Furthermore, owing to the diversity in the spreading, the proposed scheme provides a more homogeneous performance for all the nodes. In addition, the computational complexity of the SB-CSMUD is the same as that of CSMUD at the only expense of the memory requirement for hosting the block sequence at the node.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08509105.pdf","startPage":"63058","endPage":"63070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access With Sequence Block Compressed Sensing Multiuser Detection for 5G","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509105/","displayDocTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access With Sequence Block Compressed Sensing Multiuser Detection for 5G","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18582980","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8509105/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Aarhus University, Denmark"},{"fundingName":"National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access With Sequence Block Compressed Sensing Multiuser Detection for 5G","sourcePdf":"access-alam-2877477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.878921S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8509105","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509106,"authors":[{"name":"Abdeldime Mohamed Salih Abdelgader","affiliation":["Karary University, Khartoum, Sudan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8727580/8509106/abdel-2875517-small.gif","p":["Abdeldime Mohamed Salih Abdelgader received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Sudan University of Science and Technology, Khartoum, Sudan, in 2000, the M.S. degree in communication engineering from Karary University, Omdurman, Sudan, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in information science and communication engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2016.","Since 2003, he has been a Lecturer with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Karary University.

Modern switches and routers perform uniform packet sampling, which has several major drawbacks: 1) the same flow might be unnecessarily sampled multiple times in different switches; 2) all the flows traversing a switch whose sampling module is activated are sampled at the same rate; and 3) the sampling rate is fixed, even if the volume of the traffic changes. For the first time, we propose a sampling-on-demand monitoring framework. The proposed framework, presented as a component of software defined network (SDN), adds a sampling management module to the SDN controller. This module allows the controller to determine the sampling rate of each flow at each switch, according to the monitoring goals of the network operator, while taking into account the monitoring capabilities of the switch. As part of the proposed framework, the paper defines a new optimization problem called sampling allocation problem, which has to be solved by the sampling management module in order to maximize the total sampling utility. The paper presents online and offline algorithms for solving this problem. It also presents three real network management applications, executed over Mininet, which are shown to significantly benefit from the proposed framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8509118/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18345348","volume":"26","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-on-Demand in SDN","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israel Ministry of Economy under the Neptune Generic Research Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-on-Demand in SDN","sourcePdf":"tnet-cohen-2873816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066696S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"8576794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8576794","articleId":"8509118","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8509119,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Sun","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7274860/9027020/8509119/sun-2878109-small.gif","p":["Peng Sun received the PhD degree from the University of Ottawa, Canada, in 2016.

By allowing wireless communication, VNs enable information exchange among vehicles, which in turn has allowed drivers to become more aware of their surrounding road conditions. Accordingly, road safety is improved. However, due to the fast speed and frequent changes of direction of vehicles, the network topology of VNs is transient in nature. Hence, achieving efficient data dissemination/content delivery is a critical issue in the VNs-environment. In this article, we will introduce a novel passive roadside unit (RSU) detection-based proactive (PRDP) handover scenario. Consequently, the overhead of the handover process can be reduced, and the probability of successfully established connections can be improved. More precisely, by taking advantage of the Doppler effects of the received beacon signal, the passive RSU detection (PRD) scheme is derived by the maximum likelihood estimation function. Then, in combination with the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the PRDP handover protocol is designed to improve the energy efficiency of the handover procedure in the VNs-environment. We conduct intensive simulations to verify the proposed RSU detection scheme, and the experimental results further evaluate the performance of the proposed energy-efficient proactive handover protocol.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2020","volume":"5","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19428065","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2020","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8509119/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Proactive Handover Scheme for Vehicular Networks Based on Passive RSU Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSERC-SPG"},{"fundingName":"NSERC-DISCOVERY"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001804","fundingName":"Canada Research Chairs"},{"fundingName":"NSERC-CREATE TRANSIT Funds"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient Proactive Handover Scheme for Vehicular Networks Based on Passive RSU Detection","sourcePdf":"tsusc-sun-2878109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12664S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7274860","isNumber":"9027020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274860","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9027020","articleId":"8509119","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509120,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Pagani","affiliation":["Embedded Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany","Graphics and Multimedia Division, ARM Ltd., Cambridge, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8939296/8509120/pagan-2878168-small.gif","p":["Santiago Pagani (S\u201913) received the Diploma degree in electronics engineering from the Department of Electronics, National Technological University, Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree (summa cum laude) in computer science from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2016.","He is currently a Firmware Development Team Lead, ARM Ltd., Cambridge, U.K., where he runs an Agile firmware development team researching on key components for the next generation Mali GPU products.

When unattended, this issue might lead to temperature hot spots, that in turn may cause nonuniform aging, accelerate chip failure, impair reliability, and reduce the performance of the system. This paper presents an overview of several research efforts that propose to use machine learning (ML) techniques for power and thermal management on single-core and multicore processors. Traditional power and thermal management techniques rely on a certain a-priori knowledge of the chip's thermal model, as well as information of the workloads/applications to be executed (e.g., transient and average power consumption). Nevertheless, these a-priori information is not always available, and even if it is, it cannot reflect the spatial and temporal uncertainties and variations that come from the environment, the hardware, or from the workloads/applications. Contrarily, techniques based on ML can potentially adapt to varying system conditions and workloads, learning from past events in order to improve themselves as the environment changes, resulting in improved management decisions.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2878168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8939296/08509120.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8939296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2878168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning for Power, Energy, and Thermal Management on Multicore Processors: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning for Power, Energy, and Thermal Management on Multicore Processors: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509120/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19309859","htmlLink":"/document/8509120/","volume":"39","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","grantNumber":"SFB/TR 89"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning for Power, Energy, and Thermal Management on Multicore Processors: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tcad-pagani-2878168-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157782S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8939296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8939296","articleId":"8509120","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509135,"authors":[{"name":"Siwei Zhang","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Siwei","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-4390-458X","id":"37061814700"},{"name":"Thomas Jost","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Jost","orcid":"0000-0003-1413-5427","id":"37285041200"},{"name":"Robert P\u00f6hlmann","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"P\u00f6hlmann","orcid":"0000-0001-7362-9406","id":"37086331284"},{"name":"Armin Dammann","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dammann","orcid":"0000-0002-7112-1833","id":"37269758600"},{"name":"Dmitriy Shutin","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Dmitriy","lastName":"Shutin","id":"37284490200"},{"name":"Peter Adam Hoeher","affiliation":["Chair of Information and Coding Theory, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter Adam","lastName":"Hoeher","orcid":"0000-0003-3475-1710","id":"37273574400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8509135","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":769},"abstract":"Array processing is a key technology for emerging mobile networks, especially in short to moderate range and line-of-sight scenarios. In these scenarios, the incoming wavefront can be modeled by a spherical wave. The wavefront curvature, i.e., curvature of arrival (CoA), contains position information of the transmitter and is observable by an antenna array potentially asynchronous and non-coherent to the transmitter. We derive a simplified expression of the spherical wave positioning (SWP) Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound for arbitrary centro-symmetric arrays, which provides a geometrical inference about the achievable performance. Additionally, a low complexity CoA positioning algorithm is proposed. In contrast to conventional methods, the proposed algorithm requires neither multiple anchors nor coordination between devices. It also outperforms the Fresnel approximation based SWP algorithms by overcoming the model mismatch. Therefore, the proposed CoA positioning algorithm is promising for precise positioning in future mobile networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications

The experimental results show that when the measured capacitor is between 1 pF to 7.5 pF, the sensitivity is 3.53 V/pF, the linearity error is 6.13%, the SNR increases from 26.6 dB to 57.7 dB, the resolution is 3.1 fF and the time delay is about 4 \u03bcs. Comparing to five other common capacitance measuring circuits, the proposed one offers plain design, high sensitivity, and fast speed.

The costs of two-level or factored-form representations (cubes and literals) are used in most decomposition methods, as they have a high correlation with the area of cell-based designs. However, this correlation is weaker for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) based on look-up tables. Furthermore, local optimizations have limited power due to the structural bias of the circuit descriptions. This paper tries to reduce the structural biasing by remapping the look-up table network and decomposing the derived functions using the support as cost function. The proposed method improves the FPGA mapping results of a commercial tool for the 20 largest MCNC benchmarks, with gains of 28% in delay plus 18% in area when targeting delay, and a reduction of 28% in area plus 14% in delay with area as cost function. Results with 23% less area and 6% less delay are obtained after physical synthesis (post place-and-route).

Error correction codes, such as Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, are widely used to ensure data reliability. However, high raw bit error rates induced by interference noises make BCH codes become insufficient to guarantee data reliability. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are considered as the replacement due to the stronger error correction capability. Nevertheless, directly exploiting LDPC codes introduces a concern about decoding latency because of their iterative decoding in the soft decision process. To develop effective LDPC decoding algorithms, it is necessary to have a more profound understanding on flash failure patterns. This paper first observes the pair-bit errors (PBEs) characteristic of MLC NAND flash memory on a real field-programmable gate array testing platform, then proposes a PBE-aware LDPC (PAL) decoding scheme-based upon this observation, in which PBE provides the promotion information for LDPC decoding to reduce decoding latency. Simulation results show that the decoding latency can be reduced by up to 54%, compared with the conventional LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2878132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8907512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2878132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The level shifter is used in a high-side power switch driver to remove the external capacitor which is used in bootstrap technique. The level shifter consumes power only during the transition period. A delay cell is used to turn the level shifter off to reduce the power consumption period. An output voltage detector is added to turn the level shifter off even before the delay time. An asynchronous discontinuous conduction mode buck converter is designed to verify the performance of the level shifter. Simulation results show that the power consumption of the proposed level shifter decreased by 66%, while the converter efficiency increased by the maximum of 9% compared to results obtained for a conventional level shifter. The converter is fabricated using the TSMC 0.18-\u03bcm BCD process and it operates within an input range of 2-5 V when the current varies from 400 \u03bcA to 18 mA and delivers an output voltage of 1.8 V.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","volume":"66","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"18777145","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8509145/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous Power Consuming Level Shifter for Improving Power Conversion Efficiency of Buck Converter","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center Support Program supervised by the Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion (IITP)","grantNumber":"IITP-2018-2017-0-01635"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1A5A1015596"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous Power Consuming Level Shifter for Improving Power Conversion Efficiency of Buck Converter","sourcePdf":"tcsii-bien-2878042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116857S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8746742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8746742","articleId":"8509145","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509157,"authors":[{"name":"Junqi Yuan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Junqi","lastName":"Yuan","orcid":"0000-0002-7996-6574","id":"37085418238"},{"name":"Jialing Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jialing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37087096766"},{"name":"Lingli Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lingli","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-0579-3527","id":"37600175900"},{"name":"Xuegong Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xuegong","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0003-4178-4094","id":"37559473400"},{"name":"Yinshui Xia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Yinshui","lastName":"Xia","orcid":"0000-0002-3831-3876","id":"37281298900"},{"name":"Jianping Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0002-6469-1061","id":"37278205700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"8509157","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Simulated annealing","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field programmable gate array (FPGA)","placement","simulated annealing (SA)"]}],"abstract":"Placement has always been the most time-consuming part of the field programmable gate array (FPGA) compilation flow. Conventional simulated annealing has been unable to keep pace with ever increasing sizes of designs and FPGA chip resources. Without utilizing information of the circuit topology, it relies on large amounts of random swap operations, which are time-costly. This paper proposes an adaptive range-based algorithm to improve the behavior of swap operations and limit the swap distances by introducing the concept of range-limiting strategy for nets. It avoids unnecessary design space exploration, and thus can converge to near-optimal solutions much more quickly. The experimental results are based on the Titan benchmarks, which contain 4K to 30K blocks, including logic array blocks, inputs and outputs, digital signal processors, and random access memories.

However, it is time-consuming to construct an FNN with appropriate number of fuzzy rules to ensure its generalization ability. To solve this problem, an efficient optimization technique is introduced in this paper. First, a self-adaptive structural optimal algorithm (SASOA) is developed to minimize the structural risk of an FNN, leading to an improved generalization performance. Second, with the proposed SASOA, the fuzzy rules of SASOA-based FNN (SASOA-FNN) are generated or pruned systematically. This SASOA-FNN is able to organize the structure and adjust the parameters simultaneously in the learning process. Third, the convergence of SASOA-FNN is proved in the cases with fixed and updated structures, and the guidelines for selecting the parameters are given. Finally, experimental studies of the proposed SASOA-FNN have been performed on several nonlinear systems to verify the effectiveness.

Short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), a popular state-of-the-art speech intelligibility estimator, on the other hand, relies on linear correlation of speech temporal envelopes. This raises the question if a DNN training criterion based on envelope linear correlation (ELC) can lead to improved speech intelligibility performance of DNN-based speech enhancement algorithms compared to algorithms based on the STSA-MSE criterion. In this paper, we derive that, under certain general conditions, the STSA-MSE and ELC criteria are practically equivalent, and we provide empirical data to support our theoretical results. Furthermore, our experimental findings suggest that the standard STSA minimum-MSE estimator is near optimal, if the objective is to enhance noisy speech in a manner, which is optimal with respect to the STOI speech intelligibility estimator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8552740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2018.2877909","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8552740/08509159.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"295","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2018.2877909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Relationship Between Short-Time Objective Intelligibility and Short-Time Spectral-Amplitude Mean-Square Error for Speech Enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"On the Relationship Between Short-Time Objective Intelligibility and Short-Time Spectral-Amplitude Mean-Square Error for Speech Enhancement","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8509159/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18285319","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007696","fundingName":"Oticon Fonden"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Relationship Between Short-Time Objective Intelligibility and Short-Time Spectral-Amplitude Mean-Square Error for Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"taslp-kolbaek-2877909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123882S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8552740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8552740","articleId":"8509159","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8509160,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Liu","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China","University of Texas at Arlington Research Institute, University of Texas at Arlington, Fort Worth, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/9011772/8509160/liu-2875559-small.gif","p":["Hao Liu (S\u201913\u2013M\u201914) received the B.E. degree in control science and engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in automatic control from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2013.","In 2012, he was a visiting student with the Research School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia.

As power failure may occur at any time and result in data loss, crash recovery becomes vitally important in NAND flash memory storage systems. Since flash translation layers (FTLs) are used to manage flash memory, the crash recovery problem in NAND flash is how to efficiently and effectively recover FTL metadata with consistency after system crash. In this paper, we present deterministic crash recovery (DCR) that adopts a deterministic approach for crash recovery in NAND flash storage systems. The basic idea is to exploit the determinism of FTLs and reproduce events that happened between the last checkpoint and the crash point during crash recovery. Different from existing approaches that need to scan the whole flash memory chip, DCR can recover the system more efficiently by only checking a limited number of blocks based on deterministic FTL operations. We have implemented DCR in an FTL and compared it with the representative version-based and power loss recovery schemes based on an ARM-based embedded system. Experimental results show that DCR can greatly reduce the recovery time and guarantee the consistency of FTL metadata after recovery.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","volume":"38","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8509161/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DCR: Deterministic Crash Recovery for NAND Flash Storage Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702357, 61672116 and 61502309"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Foundation","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170816093943197 and JCYJ20170817100300603"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A030313045"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City","grantNumber":"18JCQNJC00300"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial General University National Development Program","grantNumber":"2014GKXM054"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of SZU","grantNumber":"803/000027060147 and 827-000073"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing High-Tech Research Program","grantNumber":"cstc2016jcyjA0332"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee","grantNumber":"GRF 152223/15E, GRF 152736/16E and GRF 152066/17E"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCR: Deterministic Crash Recovery for NAND Flash Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"tcad-chen-2878179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153473S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8907512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8907512","articleId":"8509161","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509162,"authors":[{"name":"O.

technique for the next-generation wireless communication systems. Since the signal of multiple users is mapped to the same resources in SCMA, its detection imposes a higher complexity than that of the orthogonal schemes, where each resource slot is dedicated to a single user. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity receiver for SCMA systems based on the radical variational free energy framework. By exploiting the pairwise structure of the likelihood function, the Bethe approximation is utilized for estimating the data symbols. The complexity of the proposed algorithm only increases linearly with the number of users, which is much lower than that of the maximum a posteriori detector associated with exponentially increased complexity. Furthermore, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is analyzed, and its convergence conditions are derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed receiver is capable of approaching the error probability performance of the conventional message-passing-based receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509164/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18345033","htmlLink":"/document/8509164/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","volume":"67","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity Energy-Minimization-Based SCMA Detector and Its Convergence Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61471037 and 61571041"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China","grantNumber":"201445"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61531006 and 61772233"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/PO34284/1"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council's Advanced Fellow","grantNumber":"QuantCom"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Low-Complexity Energy-Minimization-Based SCMA Detector and Its Convergence Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvt-wu-2876121-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080247S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8577058","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8577058","articleId":"8509164","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509170,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie Dick","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania"],"bio":{"p":["Stephanie Dick is an assistant professor of history and sociology of science at the University of Pennsylvania.

It can only operate in correlation with the other software that enables it, the hardware that runs it, and the communities who make, own, and maintain it. Here, we consider a phenomenon called \u201cDLL hell,\u201d a case in which those relationships broke down, endemic to the Microsoft Windows platform in the mid-to-late 1990s. Software applications often failed because they required specific dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), which other applications may have overwritten with their own preferred versions. We excavate \u201cDLL hell\u201d for insight into the experience of modern computing, especially in the 1990s, and into the history of legacy class software. In producing Windows, Microsoft had to balance a unique and formidable tension between customer expectations and investor demands. Every day, millions of people relied on software that assumed Windows would behave a certain way, even if that behavior happened to be outdated, inconvenient, or just plain broken, leaving Microsoft \u201con the hook\u201d for the uses or abuses that others made of its platform. But Microsoft was also committed to improving, repairing, and transforming their flagship product. As such, DLL hell was a product of the friction between maintenance and innovation. Microsoft embodied late 20th-century liberalism, seeking simultaneously to accommodate and to discipline various stake holders who had irreconcilable needs. DLL hell reveals the collective work, even when unsuccessful, of developing contractual norms for software as process and practice. Ultimately, many users became disaffected in the face of a perceived failure of technocratic expertise. We attend to implementation, use and misuse, management and mismanagement, in order to recover and reconstruct the complexities of a computing failure.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8620595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Annals of the History of Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Annals of the History of Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/85/8620595/08509170.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MAHC.2018.2877913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.2018.2877913","startPage":"28","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DLL Hell: Software Dependencies, Failure, and the Maintenance of Microsoft Windows","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509170/","displayDocTitle":"DLL Hell: Software Dependencies, Failure, and the Maintenance of Microsoft Windows","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8509170/","volume":"40","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"18394358","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2019","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DLL Hell: Software Dependencies, Failure, and the Maintenance of Microsoft Windows","sourcePdf":"mahc-dick-2877913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080737S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"85","isNumber":"8620595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"85","xplore-issue":"8620595","articleId":"8509170","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8509172,"authors":[{"name":"Armin Haj Aboutalebi","affiliation":["University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8907512/8509172/about-2878166-small.gif","p":["Armin Haj Aboutalebi (S\u201916) received the master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA, in 2016.

Employing STT-MRAM as the main memory offers a wide variety of benefits, but also results in unique design challenges. In particular, read disturbance characterizes accidental data corruption in STT-MRAM after it is read, leading to the need of restoring data back to memory after each read operation. In this paper, we propose both device and architecture innovations to mitigate and tolerate read disturbance. First, we quantitatively demonstrate the relationship between read disturbance and key device parameters, conducting a number of read disturbance mitigation schemes. These device-level schemes turn out to be effective in reducing the read disturbance probability, but come with costs on other design metrics. Consequently, we further propose a restore-aware memory controller design at the architecture level to tolerate read disturbance. Since the extra restores incurred by read disturbance greatly change the timing scenarios that conventional memory controllers were optimized for, directly adopting restore-agnostic DRAM memory management techniques will lead to suboptimal designs for STT-MRAM. Therefore, we propose restore-aware policy selection (RAPS), a dynamic and hybrid row buffer management scheme that factors in the inevitable data restores in STT-MRAM-based main memory. RAPS monitors the row buffer hit rate at run time, dynamically switching between two static page-closure policies. By factoring in restores, RAPS accurately captures the optimal design points, achieving optimal policy selections at run time. Our experimental results show that RAPS significantly improves system performance and energy efficiency compared to conventional page-closure policies.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2878166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2878166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8907512/08509172.pdf","startPage":"2229","endPage":"2242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8907512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating and Tolerating Read Disturbance in STT-MRAM-Based Main Memory via Device and Architecture Innovations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating and Tolerating Read Disturbance in STT-MRAM-Based Main Memory via Device and Architecture Innovations","volume":"38","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8509172/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1566158"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007130","fundingName":"University of Texas System"},{"fundingName":"GREAT seed grant from UTSA Office of Vice President for Research, Economic Development, and Knowledge Enterprise"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872305, U1705261, 61772439 and 61472336"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating and Tolerating Read Disturbance in STT-MRAM-Based Main Memory via Device and Architecture Innovations","sourcePdf":"tcad-duan-2878166-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07969S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8907512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","xplore-issue":"8907512","articleId":"8509172","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509174,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Cao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8721184/8509174/cao-2872675-small.gif","p":["Bing Cao received the B.Eng. degree from Hebei University, Baoding, China, in 2015.

HFR plays an important role in security scenarios. However, HFR remains a challenging problem due to the considerable discrepancies (i.e., shape, style, and color) between cross-modality images. Conventional HFR methods utilize only the information involved in heterogeneous face images, which is not effective because of the substantial differences between heterogeneous face images. To better address this issue, this paper proposes a data augmentation-based joint learning (DA-JL) approach. The proposed method mutually transforms the cross-modality differences by incorporating synthesized images into the learning process. The aggregated data augments the intraclass scale, which provides more discriminative information. However, this method also reduces the interclass diversity (i.e., discriminative information). We develop the DA-JL model to balance this dilemma. Finally, we obtain the similarity score between heterogeneous face image pairs through the log-likelihood ratio. Extensive experiments on a viewed sketch database, forensic sketch database, near-infrared image database, thermal-infrared image database, low-resolution photo database, and image with occlusion database illustrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8721184/08509174.pdf","startPage":"1731","endPage":"1743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2872675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2872675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8721184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Augmentation-Based Joint Learning for Heterogeneous Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Databases","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Shape","Learning systems","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","face recognition","feature extraction","image capture","image matching","learning (artificial intelligence)","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data augmentation-based joint learning approach","cross-modality differences","discriminative information","heterogeneous face image pairs","near-infrared image database","thermal-infrared image database","heterogeneous face recognition","cross-modality images","conventional HFR methods","log-likelihood ratio","viewed sketch database","forensic sketch database","low-resolution photo database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data augmentation","forensic sketch","heterogeneous face recognition (HFR)","infrared image","joint learning","viewed sketch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Data Augmentation-Based Joint Learning for Heterogeneous Face Recognition","volume":"30","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8509174/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18692028","pubMedId":"30369451","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61432014, 61876142, U1605252, 61772402, 61671339 and 61501339"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016QY01W0200"},{"fundingName":"Key Industrial Innovation Chain in Industrial Domain","grantNumber":"2016KTZDGY04-02"},{"fundingName":"National High-Level Talents Special Support Program of China","grantNumber":"CS31117200001"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST","grantNumber":"2016QNRC001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2017JM6085 and 2017JQ6007"},{"fundingName":"Young Talent Fund of the University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XJS17086"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005320","fundingName":"Xidian University"},{"fundingName":"CCF-Tencent Open Fund"},{"fundingName":"Xidian University-Intellifusion Joint Innovation Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Augmentation-Based Joint Learning for Heterogeneous Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tnnls-gao-2872675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11118S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8721184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8721184","articleId":"8509174","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509180,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Liu","affiliation":["University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-9747-7857","id":"37085680954"},{"name":"Chi-Hang Chan","affiliation":["University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Hang","lastName":"Chan","orcid":"0000-0002-7635-1101","id":"37406799000"},{"name":"Sai-Weng Sin","affiliation":["University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Sai-Weng","lastName":"Sin","orcid":"0000-0001-9346-8291","id":"37269869400"},{"name":"U.

A highly flexible distributed control strategy is proposed to achieve the balanced control between the two control objectives, which includes the containment-based voltage controller and consensus-based current controller. The terminal voltage can be bounded within a prescriptive range which means each terminal voltage is controllable instead of only controlling the average voltage; meanwhile, the current-sharing performance can be regulated among converters. The two objectives, including either bounding voltages tightly or decreasing current sharing errors, can be compromised between each other by tuning the weightings of controllers. The large-signal model is developed to analyze the tuning principle about different control parameters. The proposed strategy can provide flexible control performance according to various control requirements.

Harmonic interactions between inverters and the grid exhibit various number of complicated characteristics that threatens the system stability and power quality. In this paper, a method of harmonic resonance analysis is proposed to investigate the resonance problem in a multi-inverter grid-connected system based on resonance modal analysis (RMA) and participation factor (PF) calculations. Initially, an impedance-based analytical approach is employed and expanded to an electricity distribution network that is dominated by multiple inverters with LCL filters and proportional resonant controllers. Then, the RMA is introduced to investigate the resonant interactions among inverters and the grid. Specifically, harmonic resonance characteristics are addressed through transfer functions and the proposed method considering variation of inverter number, different inverter combinations, and critical system components. Finally, time domain simulations on the PSCAD/EMTDC platform are presented. The case study results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/8621618/08509189.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2018.2877966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2018.2877966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8621618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic Resonance Investigation of a Multi-Inverter Grid-Connected System Using Resonance Modal Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Power harmonic filters","Damping","Harmonic analysis","Impedance","Phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","invertors","power filters","power grids","power system harmonics","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel-inverter-based grid-connected system","system stability","impedance-based analytical approach","resonant interactions","multiinverter grid connected system","harmonic resonance modal analysis","resonant controllers","current control","PSCAD-EMTDC platform","transfer functions","RMA method","participation factor calculations","power quality","LCL filters","electricity distribution network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-inverters","harmonic interaction","resonance","resonance modal analysis (RMA)","transfer function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic Resonance Investigation of a Multi-Inverter Grid-Connected System Using Resonance Modal Analysis","volume":"34","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8509189/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18429337","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51707034"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20160679"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic Resonance Investigation of a Multi-Inverter Grid-Connected System Using Resonance Modal Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-hong-2877966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097725S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"8621618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8621618","articleId":"8509189","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509195,"authors":[{"name":"Hayder Al-Hraishawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8662263/8509195/alhra-2877998-small.gif","p":["Hayder Al-Hraishawi received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (First Class Hons.) in electrical engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Al-Mustansiriya University, Baghdad, Iraq, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, USA, in 2017.

A general pilot sharing scheme and two pilot sequence designs (PSDs) are investigated via fully shared (PSD-1) and partially shared (PSD-2) uplink pilots. The number of simultaneously served primary users and secondary users (SUs) in the same time-frequency resource block by the PSD-1 is higher than that of PSD-2. The transmit power constraints for the SUs are derived to mitigate the secondary co-channel interference (CCI) inflicted at the primary base-station (PBS) subject to a predefined primary interference temperature (PIT). The optimal transmit power control coefficients for the SUs with max-min fairness and the common achievable rates are derived. The cumulative detrimental effects of channel estimation errors, CCI and intra-cell/inter-cell pilot contamination are investigated. The secondary transmit power constraint and the achievable rates for the perfect channel state information (CSI) case become independent of the PIT when the number of PBS antennas grows unbounded. Therefore, the primary and secondary systems can be operated independent of each other as both intra-cell and inter-cell interference can be asymptotically mitigated at the massive MIMO PBS and secondary base-station. Nevertheless, the achievable rates and secondary power constraints for the imperfect CSI case with PSD-1 are severely degraded due to the presence of intra-cell and inter-cell pilot contamination. These performance metrics depend on the PIT even in the asymptotic PBS antenna regime. Hence, the primary and secondary systems can no longer be operated independently for imperfect CSI with PSD-1. However, PSD-2 provides an achievable rate gain over PSD-1 despite the requirement of lengthier pilot sequences of the former than that of the latter.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2018.2877998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8662263/08509195.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2018.2877998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8662263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Uplink With Underlay Spectrum Sharing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509195/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Uplink With Underlay Spectrum Sharing","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18505297","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8509195/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council (VR) and ELLIIT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Uplink With Underlay Spectrum Sharing","sourcePdf":"tccn-arumabaduge-2877998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181628S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8662263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8662263","articleId":"8509195","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509204,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulrahman S.

A mushroom-like 10-EBG unit cell arrays are arranged around the feeding network to reduce surface waves, whereas 4 \u00d7 4 MTM unit cells are placed on the back-side of the antenna to enable unidirectional radiation. The antenna is designed and embedded on a multilayer low cost, low loss, transparent, and robust polymer poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS) substrate and optimized to operate in contact with the human head. The simulated and measured results show that the antenna has a fractional bandwidth of 53.8% (1.16-1.94 GHz), more than 80% of radiation efficiency, and satisfactory field penetration in the head tissues with a safe specific absorption rate. An eight-element array is then configured on 300 \u00d7 360 \u00d7 4.1 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n PDMS material covering an average human head size and used as a worn part of the imaging system. A realistic-shaped 3-D specific anthropomorphic mannequin (SAM) head phantom is used to verify the performance of the designed array. The imaging results indicate the possibility of using the designed conformal array to detect a bleeding inside the brain using a confocal image algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2878057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8626744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2878057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/8626744/08509204.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wearable Electromagnetic Head Imaging System Using Flexible Wideband Antenna Array Based on Polymer Technology for Brain Stroke Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Wearable Electromagnetic Head Imaging System Using Flexible Wideband Antenna Array Based on Polymer Technology for Brain Stroke Diagnosis","volume":"13","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8509204/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18430200","pubMedId":"30369449","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509204/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Government Research","grantNumber":"ARC- DP150103425"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wearable Electromagnetic Head Imaging System Using Flexible Wideband Antenna Array Based on Polymer Technology for Brain Stroke Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tbcas-smalqadami-2878057-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119846S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8626744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8626744","articleId":"8509204","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509205,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxuan Huang","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","National Engineering Research Center of Digital Life, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9321228/8509205/huang-2874822-small.gif","p":["Yuxuan Huang is currently pursuing the B.Eng. degree in intelligence science and technology from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.","He is a student research assistant with the National Engineering Research Center of Digital Life, Sun Yat-sen University.

However, restoration of networks from cascading failure is still relatively unexplored. In this paper, we consider cascading failure in conjunction with the restoration process involving repairing the failed nodes in a sequential fashion. Depending on the availability of resources, we tackle the sequential recovery problem from two distinct approaches, namely, result-oriented and resource-oriented restoration approaches. In the result-oriented approach, we aim to restore the network to the largest extent and within the shortest time. Heuristic network restoration strategies based on node load or degree are proposed. For resource-oriented restoration, we aim to maximize the increase of network size with a given number of nodes to be repaired, and we propose a novel iterative strategy to improve performance. Simulation results on the Bar\u00e1basi-Albert scale-free network, Internet autonomous system-level network, and IEEE 300 bus power system have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed sequential recovery strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2874822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/9321228/08509205.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2018.2874822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9321228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Restorations of Complex Networks After Cascading Failures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509205/","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Restorations of Complex Networks After Cascading Failures","volume":"51","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2021","accessionNumber":"20287044","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8509205/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503420 and U1711267"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"17lgpy120"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC General Research Fund","grantNumber":"152096/17E"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Restorations of Complex Networks After Cascading Failures","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wu-2874822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076906S","chronDate":"Jan.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9321228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9321228","articleId":"8509205","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509207,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Heng Liu","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8907512/8509207/liu-2878181-small.gif","p":["Chin-Heng Liu received the B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree.","His current research interests include threshold logic synthesis, optimization, verification for very large-scale integration designs, and automation for emerging technologies."]},"firstName":"Chin-Heng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087095252"},{"name":"Chia-Chun Lin","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8907512/8509207/lin-2878181-small.gif","p":["Chia-Chun Lin received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include logic synthesis, optimization, verification for very large-scale integration designs, and automation for emerging technologies."]},"firstName":"Chia-Chun","lastName":"Lin","orcid":"0000-0002-0136-9825","id":"37086166914"},{"name":"Yung-Chih Chen","affiliation":["Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8907512/8509207/chen-2878181-small.gif","p":["Yung-Chih Chen received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2003, 2005, and 2011, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

The power of Blockchain is that it can achieve the consensus of an ordered set of transactions among nodes which do not trust each other, even with the existence of malicious nodes. However, compared to traditional databases, the current Blockchain technology still cannot handle a massive number of transactions, which is caused by many factors, such as the consensus protocol, structure of the blocks and storage challenge. Among them, the high storage requirement is a key factor that prevents the wide usage of Blockchain on various devices such as mobile phones or low-end PCs. In this paper, to address the storage challenge, we introduce a novel concept called Consensus Unit (CU), which organizes different nodes into one unit and lets them to store at least one copy of Blockchain data in the system together. Based on this idea, we further define the Blocks Assignment Optimization (BAO) problem which determines the optimal assignment of blocks such that the storage space is fully used and the query cost is minimized. We prove that the BAO problem is NP-hard. Thus, we propose three efficient heuristic algorithms to solve the static assignment problem. Furthermore, we present solutions to address the dynamic scenarios when new blocks arrive and nodes join or depart from the CU. To verify the effectiveness of CU, we have conducted extensive experiments on synthetic data and BLOCKBENCH [1].

This query has found new applications in the fast-growing location-based services, e.g., finding the k nearest Uber cars of a user for ridesharing. KNN queries in these applications are non-trivial to process due to the frequent location updates of data objects (e.g., movements of the cars). This calls for novel spatial indexes with high efficiency in not only query processing but also update handling. To address this need, we propose an index structure that uses a \"lazy update\" strategy to reduce the costs of update handling without sacrificing query efficiency or answer accuracy. We cache the location updates of data objects and only update the corresponding entries in the index when they are queried. We further propose a kNN query algorithm based on this index. This algorithm takes advantage of the strengths of both the CPU and the GPU. It first identifies the queried region and updates the index over this region using the GPU. Then, it uses the GPU to query the index and produce a candidate result set, which is later refined by the CPU to obtain the final query answer. We conduct experiments on real data and compare the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art kNN algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms by orders of magnitude in query time.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2018.00084","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476188/8509221/08509305.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2018.00084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU Accelerated Update Efficient Index for kNN Queries in Road Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509305/","displayDocTitle":"A GPU Accelerated Update Efficient Index for kNN Queries in Road Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Apr 2018","accessionNumber":"18195655","htmlLink":"/document/8509305/","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPU Accelerated Update Efficient Index for kNN Queries in Road Networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"552000a881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113492S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476188","isNumber":"8509221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476188","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8509221","articleId":"8509305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8509318,"authors":[{"name":"Bowen Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Bowen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086509819"},{"name":"Yanyan Shen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086094110"},{"name":"Yanmin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Yanmin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086509134"},{"name":"Jiadi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Jiadi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086512458"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5520-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5521-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"8509318","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Graphics processing units","Indexes","Query processing","Bandwidth","Instruction sets","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database indexing","graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","query processing","resource allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory range","similarity queries","trajectory query processing systems","GPU-accelerated framework","similarity measure","real-world trajectories","invalid trajectories","trajectory points","real-life trajectory datasets","processing trajectory queries","trajectory data","GPU-friendly index","GTIDX","parallel verification","Morton-based encoding method","streaming multiprocessors","acceptable indexing cost","edit distance on real sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["trajectory","query"]}],"abstract":"The increasing amount of trajectory data facilitates a wide spectrum of practical applications. In many such applications, large numbers of trajectory range and similarity queries are issued continuously, which calls for high-throughput trajectory query processing. Traditional in-memory databases lack considerations of the unique features of trajectories, thus suffering from inferior performance. Existing trajectory query processing systems are typically designed for only one type of trajectory queries, i.e., either range or similarity query, but not for both. Inspired by the massive parallelism on GPUs, in this paper, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework, named GAT, to support both types of trajectory queries (i.e., both range and similarity queries) with high throughput. For similarity queries, we adopt the Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) as the similarity measure which is accurate and robust to noise in real-world trajectories. GAT employs a GPU-friendly index called GTIDX to effectively filter invalid trajectories for both range and similarity queries, and exploits the GPU to perform parallel verifications. To accelerate the verification process on the GPU, we apply the Morton-based encoding method to reorganize trajectory points and facilitate coalesced data accesses for individual point data in global memory, which reduces the global memory bandwidth requirement significantly. We also propose a technique of grouping size-varying cells into balanced blocks with similar numbers of trajectory points, to achieve load balancing among the Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) of the GPU. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of GAT using two real-life trajectory datasets. The results show that GAT is scalable and achieves high throughput with acceptable indexing cost.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2018.00097","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476188/8509221/08509318.pdf","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2018.00097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Processing Trajectory Queries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509318/","displayDocTitle":"A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Processing Trajectory Queries","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Apr 2018","accessionNumber":"18195661","htmlLink":"/document/8509318/","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Processing Trajectory Queries","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"552000b037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124164S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476188","isNumber":"8509221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476188","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8509221","articleId":"8509318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8509321,"authors":[{"name":"Chenjuan Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Chenjuan","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085374235"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085399190"},{"name":"Jilin Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jilin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086103238"},{"name":"Christian Jensen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37339194000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5520-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5521-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"8509321","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":661},"abstract":"Motivated by the increasing availability of vehicle trajectory data, we propose learn-to-route, a comprehensive trajectory-based routing solution. Specifically, we first construct a graph-like structure from trajectories as the routing infrastructure. Second, we enable trajectory-based routing given an arbitrary (source, destination) pair. In the first step, given a road network and a collection of trajectories, we propose a trajectory-based clustering method that identifies regions in a road network. If a pair of regions are connected by trajectories, we maintain the paths used by these trajectories and learn a routing preference for travel between the regions. As trajectories are skewed and sparse, %and although the introduction of regions serves to consolidate the sparse data, many region pairs are not connected by trajectories. We thus transfer routing preferences from region pairs with sufficient trajectories to such region pairs and then use the transferred preferences to identify paths between the regions. In the second step, we exploit the above graph-like structure to achieve a comprehensive trajectory-based routing solution. Empirical studies with two substantial trajectory data sets offer insight into the proposed solution, indicating that it is practical. A comparison with a leading routing service offers evidence that the paper's proposal is able to enhance routing quality.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Routing","Roads","Vehicles","Fuels","Clustering algorithms","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","road traffic","telecommunication network routing","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing infrastructure","road network","trajectory-based clustering method","routing preference","region pairs","sufficient trajectories","substantial trajectory data sets","leading routing service","routing quality","sparse trajectory","vehicle trajectory data","learn-to-route","comprehensive trajectory-based routing solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Trajectories","Routing","Routing preferences"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2018.00100","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476188/8509221/08509321.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2018.00100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Route with Sparse Trajectory Sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Route with Sparse Trajectory Sets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509321/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Apr 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8509321/","accessionNumber":"18195684","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Route with Sparse Trajectory Sets","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"552000b073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102837S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476188","isNumber":"8509221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476188","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8509221","articleId":"8509321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8509419,"authors":[{"name":"Siyuan Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"firstName":"Siyuan","lastName":"Han","id":"37086503292"},{"name":"Zihuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"firstName":"Zihuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086503870"},{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086388428"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5520-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5521-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"8509419","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":741},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509419","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Bitcoin","Jupiter","Mobile handsets","Servers","Systems architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","electronic money","financial data processing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile-based Blockchain platform","Jupiter","mobile devices","distributed consensus protocol","distributed ledger","immutable ledger","mobile network","Bitcoin"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain"]}],"abstract":"With the success of Bitcoin, the technique behind it, Blockchain, is catching massive attention recently. Blockchain is a collection of several techniques like cryptology, P2P and distributed consensus protocol. The main idea of Blockchain is that nodes in the network keep the same distributed ledger. Because of this immutable ledger, a trusted bridge is built among parties without fully trust. Blockchain can be used in variety of areas, especially in financial fields, like supply chain management, cross-border payment and global bank settlement. Meanwhile, we can observe that mobile network is growing rapidly and nibbling the PC market. However, the current public Blockchain applications like Bitcoin or Ethereum require the nodes to store the whole ledger which exceeds the capacity of the mobile devices. Thus, we need to develop a blockchain platform to support mobile devices. In this demo, we introduce Jupiter, a mobile-based Blockchain platform which provides a novel concept called consensus unit (CU) to alleviate the storage problem of mobile.

Part of the data preparation, standardization, and cleaning processes, such as data matching and deduplication for instance, could be automated by making a ML model \"learn\" and predict the matches routinely. Data integration can also benefit from ML as the data to be integrated can be sampled and used to design the data integration algorithms. After the initial manual work to setup the labels, ML models can start learning from the new incoming data that are being submitted for standardization, integration, and cleaning. The more data supplied to the model, the better the ML algorithm can perform and deliver accurate results. Therefore, ML is more scalable compared to traditional and time-consuming approaches. Nevertheless, many ML algorithms require an out-of-the-box tuning and their parameters and scope are often not adapted to the problem at hand. To make an example, in cleaning and integration processes, the window sizes of values used for the ML models cannot be arbitrarily chosen and require an adaptation of the learning parameters. This tutorial will survey the recent trend of applying machine learning solutions to improve data management tasks and establish new paradigms to sharpen data error detection, cleaning, and integration at the data instance level, as well as at schema, system, and user levels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Task analysis","Cleaning","Data integration","Data models","Machine learning","Tutorials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data integration","data integrity","database management systems","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning techniques","data management tasks","data cleaning","data preparation","data matching","deduplication","data integration algorithms","learning parameters","data error detection","data instance level","query inference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine learning","data cleaning","error detection","data repairing","query inference","data management","clustering","classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2018.00226","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8476188/8509221/08509447.pdf","startPage":"1735","endPage":"1738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2018.00226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning to Data Management: A Round Trip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning to Data Management: A Round Trip","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509447/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Apr 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8509447/","accessionNumber":"18195658","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning to Data Management: A Round Trip","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"552000b735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083838S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8476188","isNumber":"8509221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8476188","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8509221","articleId":"8509447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8509474,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiling Luo","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhiling","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085545455"},{"name":"Ling Liu","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085851764"},{"name":"Jianwei Yin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Yin","id":"37333523200"},{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37086510338"},{"name":"Zhaohui Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085796255"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5520-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5521-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"8509474","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Transforms","Bioinformatics","Social network services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feedforward neural nets","graph theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph classification","NgramCNN deep learning","diagonal convolution layer","n-gram graph block","ngram convolutional neural networks","n-gram deep convolutional neural network","convolution layers","n-gram normalization","n-gram blocks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph Classification","Graph Mining","Ngram","Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"abstract":"NgramCNN is a deep convolutional neural network developed for classification of graphs based on common substructure patterns and their latent relationships in the collection of graphs.

The displacement current of the gate-drain capacitor and the voltage drop on the common-source inductors can induce the crosstalk. In order to suppress the crosstalk, this paper proposes a novel gate driver, in which two additional capacitors are added to create the low turn-off gate impedance. With this proposed driver, the common-source parasitic inductor can be decoupled from the gate loop and the displacement current of the gate-drain capacitor can be bypassed. In addition, the operating principle and the parameters design are also analyzed. Finally, the crosstalk in the non-Kelvin package and the Kelvin package are tested by experiments, the validity of the analysis and the effectiveness for suppression the crosstalk are proved as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/8638652/08509568.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2877968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2877968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8638652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Gate Turn-OFF Impedance Driver for Suppressing Crosstalk of SiC MOSFET Based on Different Discrete Packages","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Crosstalk","MOSFET","Capacitors","Silicon carbide","Switches","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","inductors","power MOSFET","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate-drain capacitor","common-source inductors","gate driver","low turn-off gate impedance","common-source parasitic inductor","gate loop","displacement current","low gate turn-OFF impedance driver","higher switching speed","silicon carbide MOSFET","phase-leg configuration","power electronic equipment","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-source inductors","crosstalk","driver","gate\u2013drain capacitor","package","silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Low Gate Turn-OFF Impedance Driver for Suppressing Crosstalk of SiC MOSFET Based on Different Discrete Packages","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8509568/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18629457","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51877007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Gate Turn-OFF Impedance Driver for Suppressing Crosstalk of SiC MOSFET Based on Different Discrete Packages","sourcePdf":"jestpe-li-2877968-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117801S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"8638652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8638652","articleId":"8509568","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509573,"authors":[{"name":"Vibhum Singh","affiliation":["Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Indore, Indore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8509573/singh-2877130-small.gif","p":["Vibhum Singh (S\u201918) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow, India, in 2011, and the M.Tech. degree in telecommunication system engineering from IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India, in 2015.

Herein, we exploit both direct and relay links from a primary satellite source to multiple terrestrial users with the coexistence of a secondary transmitter-receiver pair on the ground. Based on an overlay approach, the secondary transmitter provides an amplify-and-forward-based relay cooperation to the primary satellite network that employs opportunistic scheduling of multiple users. The underlying user scheduling strategy is based on satisfying the criterion of minimal outage probability (OP) for the primary network and, eventually, exploring more opportunities of the spectrum sharing for the secondary terrestrial network. By considering the widely adopted Shadowed-Rician fading model for the satellite links while the Nakagami-m fading model for the terrestrial links, we derive the analytical expressions for the OP of the primary satellite network and the secondary terrestrial network and further highlight the corresponding achievable diversity orders. We also examine the impact of power splitting factor for spectrum sharing between primary and secondary networks.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08509573.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"65539","endPage":"65547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Relaying Cooperation in Satellite-Terrestrial Systems With Multiuser Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Relaying Cooperation in Satellite-Terrestrial Systems With Multiuser Diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495641","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8509573/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008628","fundingName":"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cognitive Relaying Cooperation in Satellite-Terrestrial Systems With Multiuser Diversity","sourcePdf":"access-singh-2877130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.256105S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8509573","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509578,"authors":[{"name":"Rasoul Asghari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8509578/asgha-2878038-small.gif","p":["Rasoul Asghari received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, South Tehran Branch.

The controller takes the advantage of delay as a design parameter to solve the SVC contribution limitation problem resulting from delays in feedback loops. To determine the delay and controller parameters, an algorithm is proposed to minimize the rightmost real part of the electromechanical oscillation modes in the design stage such that the system robustness against the small variations of time delay is provided. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated by conducting a number of simulations on the standard four-machine and 16-machine 68-bus test power systems. The results reveal that compared to the existing methods, the proposed method not only exhibits a better damaging performance but also introduces a significant delay margin in a certain range of feedback delays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8509578/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18584913","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method to Design Delay-Scheduled Controllers for Damping Inter-Area Oscillations","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Social Policy Grant, School of Engineering, Nazarbayev University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Method to Design Delay-Scheduled Controllers for Damping Inter-Area Oscillations","sourcePdf":"access-salaynaderi-2878038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086347S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8509578","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8509581,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, School of Electronics Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8509581/li-2877957-small.gif","p":["Wei Li is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

Thus, it enables OFDM-like channel estimation with low complexity for FBMC/OQAM and removes the inter-symbol interference/inter-carrier interference in FBMC/OQAM channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed preamble design can be easily extended to support multiple antennas (MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed preamble length could be very close to those of conventional preamble design such as the interference cancellation method, and the channel estimation with the proposed preamble could obtain good performance both in single antenna and MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08509581.pdf","startPage":"64698","endPage":"64707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Preamble Design Based on Comb-Type Pilots for Channel Estimation in FBMC/OQAM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Interference","OFDM","Indexes","Time-frequency analysis","MIMO communication","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel bank filters","channel estimation","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comb-type pilots","CTP","filter bank multicarrier","offset quadrature amplitude modulation systems","OFDM systems","FBMC-OQAM systems","inter-symbol interference","preamble design","inter-carrier interference","FBMC-OQAM channel estimation","multiple antennas","interference cancellation","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Preamble","comb-type pilots","channel estimation","FBMC/OQAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Preamble Design Based on Comb-Type Pilots for Channel Estimation in FBMC/OQAM Systems","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8509581/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495646","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571200"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2014D09"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Efficient Preamble Design Based on Comb-Type Pilots for Channel Estimation in FBMC/OQAM Systems","sourcePdf":"access-qu-2877957-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141052S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8509581","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509585,"authors":[{"name":"Chuanxue Jin","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8509585/jin-2877958-small.gif","p":["Chuanxue Jin received the M.S. degree from the National Key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), in 2006.

However, the readability issue has become a new obstacle for STT-RAM in deeply-scaled technology nodes, owing to (a) the increasing process-voltage-temperature variations but reduced supply voltage, resulting in low sensing margin (SM); (b) reduced current margin between the read current and the critical write current of magnetic tunnel junction, leading to the high read disturbance (RD). Here, to deal with the readability issue of deeply-scaled STT-RAM, we propose a full-sensing-margin dual-reference sensing (FSM-DRS) scheme via exploiting analog signal processing within the sensing circuit design. The proposed FSM-DRS scheme improves SM significantly but with no increase of RD through: (a) including two reference cells which utilize the same structure of the data cells to provide two reference signals, thus reducing the reference mismatch or regularity problem; and (b) adding an analog signal pre-processing operation between the data and reference signals before decision, doubling SM without increasing RD. In comparison with the typical sensing schemes, our simulation results (under the 40 nm technology node) show that our FSM-DRS scheme has an ~70% enhancement in average SM as well as a \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim 10\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n decrease in bit error rate.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08509589.pdf","startPage":"64250","endPage":"64260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Full-Sensing-Margin Dual-Reference Sensing Scheme for Deeply-Scaled STT-RAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"A Full-Sensing-Margin Dual-Reference Sensing Scheme for Deeply-Scaled STT-RAM","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8509589/","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871008, 61501013 and 61571023"},{"fundingName":"National Key Technology Program of China","grantNumber":"2017ZX01032101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Full-Sensing-Margin Dual-Reference Sensing Scheme for Deeply-Scaled STT-RAM","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2878012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093694S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8509589","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509590,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanfei Dai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Computing and Intelligent Information Processing, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8509590/dai-2877934-small.gif","p":["Yuanfei Dai received the B.S. degree in information and computing science from Shandong Agricultural University, Tai\u2019an, China, in 2015, and the M.S. degree in software engineering from Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China, in 2018, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Mathematics and Computer Science.

It is a crucial constituent in natural language processing. Up till the present moment, most previous neural network models for this task either focus on using the handcrafted syntactic features or learning semantic representations of raw word sequences, they have no capacity for encoding the whole sentence representation including syntax and semantic information. In general, information of syntax and semantics can both have significant effect on classifying relation. Based on this idea, we propose a novel two-channel neural network architecture with attention mechanism in the paper to handle this task. First, we employ bidirectional sequence long short-term memory (LSTM) channel to capture the semantic information and acquire syntactic knowledge by utilizing tree structure LSTM channel. Second, sentence-level attention mechanism for word sequences is used to determine which parts of the sentence are most influential component. Eventually, we conduct experiments on two real-world datasets: the Wikipedia and the SemEval2010 Task8 dataset. The experimental results on datasets demonstrate that our method can make better use of the information contained in sentences and achieves impressive improvements on relation classification as compared with the existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18495650","htmlLink":"/document/8509590/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2018","volume":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Relation Classification via LSTMs Based on Sequence and Tree Structure","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB1002000"},{"fundingName":"Guiding Project of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2018H0017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Relation Classification via LSTMs Based on Sequence and Tree Structure","sourcePdf":"access-dai-2877934-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130561S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8509590","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509591,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lei Yang received the B.E. degree from Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, China, in 2014.

The traditional teaching-playback mode and the off-line programming mode cannot meet the automation demand and self-adaptive ability of welding robots. In order to improve the efficiency of welding robots, this paper proposes a novel 3-D path extraction method of weld seams based on a stereo-structured light sensor. Faced with the low efficiency of the line-structured light and the poor robustness of passive vision, the seam extraction based on a point cloud processing algorithm is proposed which could well adapt to the weld seams with different types and different groove sizes. Meanwhile, the position information and pose information of weld seam are established to serve 3-D path teaching of a welding robot. The experimental results show that the maximum path extraction error of V-type butt joint is less than 0.7 mm. The proposed scheme could well serve for the 3-D path teaching task before welding.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2018.2877976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8585164/08509591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2018.2877976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8585164","startPage":"763","endPage":"773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel 3-D Path Extraction Method for Arc Welding Robot Based on Stereo Structured Light Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel 3-D Path Extraction Method for Arc Welding Robot Based on Stereo Structured Light Sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2019","accessionNumber":"18328905","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8509591/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFD0701401"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel 3-D Path Extraction Method for Arc Welding Robot Based on Stereo Structured Light Sensor","sourcePdf":"jsen-li-2877976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112312S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8585164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8585164","articleId":"8509591","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8509594,"authors":[{"name":"Neng-Wu Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Neng-Wu","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-9357-1299","id":"37085875299"},{"name":"Lei Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhu","orcid":"0000-0002-5348-7532","id":"37085348904"},{"name":"Wai-Wa Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Wai-Wa","lastName":"Choi","orcid":"0000-0002-9422-4923","id":"37337342700"},{"name":"Guang Fu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Fu","orcid":"0000-0002-3700-2128","id":"37531977400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"8509594","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2524},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","Electric fields","Microstrip antennas","Wideband","Impedance","Microstrip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","aperture antennas","broadband antennas","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel slots","radiating patch","radiation pattern","broadside radiation","prototype aperture-coupled MPA","low-profile wideband aperture-fed microstrip antenna","low-profile wideband aperture-fed microstrip patch antenna","radiation characteristic","rectangular MPA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperture fed","low profile","microstrip patch antenna (MPA)","radiation pattern improvement","wide bandwidth"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509594","abstract":"A low-profile wideband aperture-fed microstrip patch antenna (MPA) under radiation of TM\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">12</sub>\n and TM\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">30</sub>\n modes is proposed with improved radiation patterns.

In addition, the width of the radiating patch is progressively enlarged in order to reallocate the dual modes in proximity to each other. With these arrangements, a wide bandwidth with improved radiation characteristics is obtained for the antenna under dual resonance. Finally, a prototype aperture-coupled MPA is fabricated and measured. The simulated and measured results agree well with each other, thus demonstrating that its impedance bandwidth is dramatically extended to about 14.8% with a low-profile property of about 0.048 free-space wavelength in thickness.

It is, however, challenging to preoperatively predict surgery duration since it varies significantly depending on the patient condition, surgeon skills, and intraoperative situation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning pipeline, referred to as RSDNet, which automatically estimates the remaining surgery duration (RSD) intraoperatively by using only visual information from laparoscopic videos. The previous state-of-the-art approaches for RSD prediction are dependent on manual annotation, whose generation requires expensive expert knowledge and is time-consuming, especially considering the numerous types of surgeries performed in a hospital and the large number of laparoscopic videos available. A crucial feature of RSDNet is that it does not depend on any manual annotation during training, making it easily scalable to many kinds of surgeries. The generalizability of our approach is demonstrated by testing the pipeline on two large datasets containing different types of surgeries: 120 cholecystectomy and 170 gastric bypass videos. The experimental results also show that the proposed network significantly outperforms a traditional method of estimating RSD without utilizing manual annotation. Further, this paper provides a deeper insight into the deep learning network through visualization and interpretation of the features that are automatically learned.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8679969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2878055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8679969/08509608.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1078","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2018.2878055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RSDNet: Learning to Predict Remaining Surgery Duration from Laparoscopic Videos Without Manual Annotations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"RSDNet: Learning to Predict Remaining Surgery Duration from Laparoscopic Videos Without Manual Annotations","volume":"38","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8509608/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18578793","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2019","pubMedId":"30371356","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509608/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche","grantNumber":"ANR-11-LABX-0004 and ANR-10-IAHU-02"},{"fundingName":"BPI France","grantNumber":"CONDOR"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007065","fundingName":"Nvidia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RSDNet: Learning to Predict Remaining Surgery Duration from Laparoscopic Videos Without Manual Annotations","sourcePdf":"tmi-yengera-2878055-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062027S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8679969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8679969","articleId":"8509608","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8509610,"authors":[{"name":"Mercedes E.

However, the straightforward CNN-based network architecture still finds obstacles when effectively exploiting the relationships between hyperspectral imaging (HSI) features in the spectral-spatial domain, which is a key factor to deal with the high level of complexity present in remotely sensed HSI data. Despite the fact that deeper architectures try to mitigate these limitations, they also find challenges with the convergence of the network parameters, which eventually limit the classification performance under highly demanding scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture based on spectral-spatial capsule networks in order to achieve a highly accurate classification of HSIs while significantly reducing the network design complexity. Specifically, based on Hinton's capsule networks, we develop a CNN model extension that redefines the concept of capsule units to become spectral-spatial units specialized in classifying remotely sensed HSI data. The proposed model is composed by several building blocks, called spectral-spatial capsules, which are able to learn HSI spectral-spatial features considering their corresponding spatial positions in the scene, their associated spectral signatures, and also their possible transformations. Our experiments, conducted using five well-known HSI data sets and several state-of-the-art classification methods, reveal that our HSI classification approach based on spectral-spatial capsules is able to provide competitive advantages in terms of both classification accuracy and computational time.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2871782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8674707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2871782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and

Parkinson's disease is characterized by limited motor ability of a patient. Freezing of gait is a major nonmotor condition among aging patients and its evaluation can reduce the chances of any secondary disorders. In this paper, amplitude and phase information of the radio signals observed for a fixed period of time are used to differentiate the motor and nonmotor symptoms. The amplitude information is classified using a support vector machine, while the linear transformation is applied to obtain sanitized phase information for detection. The proposed method is very handy with the minimum deployment overhead. The analysis shows that this method also offers a high-accuracy level of around 99% based on the observation of a number of patients. These features make it an attractive solution for real-time patient monitoring systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Antennas","Monitoring","Legged locomotion","Sensors","Wireless communication","Diseases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","gait analysis","medical disorders","neurophysiology","patient diagnosis","patient monitoring","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["debilitating condition","neurological disorder","motor ability","nonmotor condition","secondary disorders","nonmotor symptoms","support vector machine","linear transformation","Parkinson disease","phase information","patient monitoring systems","gait detection","leaky wave cable","gait freezing","amplitude information classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antennas","freezing of gait (FOG)","leaky wave cable (LWC)","Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD)","radio propagation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2018.2878081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8613096/08509611.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8613096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2018.2878081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Freezing of Gait Detection Considering Leaky Wave Cable","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Freezing of Gait Detection Considering Leaky Wave Cable","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509611/","volume":"67","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8509611/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18393636","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671349, 61301175 and 61601338"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018T111023"},{"fundingName":"International Scientific and Technological Cooperation and Exchange Projects in Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2017KW-005"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB180205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Freezing of Gait Detection Considering Leaky Wave Cable","sourcePdf":"tap-yang-2878081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156281S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8613096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8613096","articleId":"8509611","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8509612,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuele Depaoli","affiliation":["Studio di Microelettronica, STMicroelectronics, Pavia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8613098/8509612/depao-2873602-small.gif","p":["Emanuele Depaoli was born in Pavia, Italy, in 1980.

The receiver equalization relies on a flexible continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), providing a very accurate channel inversion through a transfer function that can be optimally adapted at low frequency, mid-frequency, and high frequency independently. The CTLE meets the performance requirements of CEI-56G-VSR without requiring the decision feedback equalizer (DFE) implementation. As a result, timing constraints for comparators in data and edge sampling paths may be relaxed by using track-and-hold (T&H) stages, saving power consumption. At the maximum speed, the receiver draws 180 mA from 1-V supply, corresponding to 2.8 mW/Gb/s only. The transmitter embeds a flexible feed-forward equalizer (FFE) which can be reconfigured to comply with legacy standards. A comparison between current-mode (CM) and voltage-mode (VM) TX drivers is proposed, proving through experiments that the latter yields larger PAM-4 eye openings, thanks to the intrinsically higher speed. The full transceiver (TX, RX, and clock generation) operates from 16 to 64 Gb/s in PAM-4 and 8 to 32 Gb/s in non-return-to-zero (NRZ), and supports 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 oversampling to reduce data rate down to 2 Gb/s.

It is well known that biometrics brings to the security field a new paradigm; unlike traditional systems, individuals are not identified by something that they have or they know, but by what they are. While such an approach entails some clear advantages, an important question remains: is what we are today the same as what we will be tomorrow? This paper addresses such a key problem in the fingerprint modality based on a database of over 400K impressions coming from more than 250K different fingers. The database was acquired under real operational conditions and contains fingerprints from subjects aged 0-25 and 65-98 years.

Considering the average success probability (ASP) of file delivery as the performance metric, we derive expressions for the association probability of the typical user to the mmWave and \u03bcWave networks using stochastic geometric tools. Accordingly, we provide an upper bound on the ASP of file delivery and formulate the content caching placement scheme as an optimization problem with respect to caching probabilities, which jointly optimizes the ASP of file delivery considering both content placement and delivery phases. To simplify the non-convex problem and obtain design insights, we split it into two scenarios: 1) noise-limited and 2) interference-limited, and then propose optimal caching placement algorithms for both. We numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes under several essential factors, such as content popularity, cache size, target data rate, blockages in the mmWave network, BS density, and path loss and also compare it with other common proactive caching schemes, namely uniform caching, caching M most popular files, and random caching. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed caching scheme over others, albeit certain trade-offs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2877969","startPage":"1645","endPage":"1662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08509616.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analysis on Caching Placement for Millimeter\u2013Micro-Wave Hybrid Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis on Caching Placement for Millimeter\u2013Micro-Wave Hybrid Networks","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18467835","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8509616/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000732","fundingName":"UK-India Education and Research Initiative","grantNumber":"DST-UKIERI-2016-17-0060"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N014073/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analysis on Caching Placement for Millimeter\u2013Micro-Wave Hybrid Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhang-2877969-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.195464S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8509616","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509619,"authors":[{"name":"Lanqiang Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Lanqiang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-0402-0677","id":"37086241019"},{"name":"Shixin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Shixin","lastName":"Zhu","orcid":"0000-0002-2845-3568","id":"37407518400"},{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-7324-4757","id":"37086245146"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8509619","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["3G mobile communication","Generators","Photonics","Synchronization","Error correction codes","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","error correction codes","error statistics","quantum noise","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum noise","cyclic codes","Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECCs","misalignment errors","good error-correcting capability","bit error","phase error","cyclotomic classes","special quantum error-correcting codes","QSCs","quantum synchronizable codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum synchronizable codes","cyclic codes","cyclotomic classes","dual-containing codes","minimum distances"]}],"abstract":"Quantum synchronizable codes (QSCs) are special quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) that correct the effects of both quantum noise on qubits and misalignment in block synchronization.

However, a key challenge for mmWave HetNets is to manage the user mobility and handovers among mmWave small cells exploiting highly directional antennas and conventional microwave macro cells. In this paper, we propose a new efficient handover decision algorithm based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to optimize the overall service experience of users in mmWave HetNets. By utilizing user's mobility information (velocity and location), the proposed algorithm avoids excessive handovers and effectively tackles beamforming misalignments, and signal blockages in mmWave small cells. To improve the computational efficiency of the MDP, we apply the action elimination method by exploiting unique handover properties of mmWave HetNets. While maintaining optimality, theoretical analysis shows that our proposed handover decision algorithm can reduce the computational complexity by 0.25M|B\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n| + 0.25M/(M - 1) times, where M is the number of base stations and |B\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n| is the number of beamwidth options for mmWave beamforming. Mobility-trace driven numerical results demonstrate the optimality of our proposed algorithm compared with other benchmark schemes and its low computational complexity over the traditional approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","volume":"67","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18467839","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8509624/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Managing Vertical Handovers in Millimeter Wave Heterogeneous Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing Vertical Handovers in Millimeter Wave Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-li-2877326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172988S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8509624","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509631,"authors":[{"name":"Lixing Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8570921/8509631/chen-2876823-small.gif","p":["Lixing Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the College of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

However, placing edge service in every possible edge site by an ASP is practically infeasible due to the ASP's prohibitive budget requirement. In this paper, we investigate the edge service placement problem of an ASP under a limited budget, where the ASP dynamically rents computing/storage resources in edge sites to host its applications in close proximity to end users. Since the benefit of placing edge service in a specific site is usually unknown to the ASP a priori, optimal placement decisions must be made while learning this benefit. We pose this problem as a novel combinatorial contextual bandit learning problem. It is \u201ccombinatorial\u201d because only a limited number of edge sites can be rented to provide the edge service given the ASP's budget. It is \u201ccontextual\u201d because we utilize user context information to enable finer-grained learning and decision-making. To solve this problem and optimize the edge computing performance, we propose SEEN, a Spatial-temporal Edge sErvice placemeNt algorithm. Furthermore, SEEN is extended to scenarios with overlapping service coverage by incorporating a disjunctively constrained knapsack problem. In both cases, we prove that our algorithm achieves a sublinear regret bound when it is compared with an Oracle algorithm that knows the exact benefit information. Simulations are carried out on a real-world dataset, whose results show that SEEN significantly outperforms benchmark solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2876823","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

The proposed approach serves as a proof-of-concept that we can localize users by training an ML model with noise-free RSS and using the trained model to estimate the test user locations from their noisy RSS. We consider two GP methods for localization, namely, the conventional GP (CGP) and the numerical approximation GP (NaGP). We find that the CGP provides unrealistically small 2\u03c3 error-bars on the location estimates. Therefore, we derive the true predictive distribution and employ NaGP to obtain realistic 2\u03c3 error-bars on the location estimates. Next, we derive a Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) on the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) performance of the two GP methods. Numerical studies reveal that: 1) the NaGP indeed provides realistic 2\u03c3 error-bars on the estimated locations; 2) both the CGP and NaGP achieve RMSEs that are close to the BCRLBs; 3) the presence of correlated shadowing improves the RMSE performance; and 4) extrapolation to the zero input noise scenario can significantly improve the RMSE achieved by the NaGP.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2876832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8570921/08509634.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2876832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8570921","startPage":"8402","endPage":"8417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning Methods for RSS-Based User Positioning in Distributed Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8509634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning Methods for RSS-Based User Positioning in Distributed Massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509634/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18321010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8509634/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning Methods for RSS-Based User Positioning in Distributed Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"twc-prasad-2876832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211756S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8570921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8570921","articleId":"8509634","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8509635,"authors":[{"name":"Aidin Ferdowsi","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8642462/8509635/ferdo-2878025-small.gif","p":["Aidin Ferdowsi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Iran, in 2016.

In this paper, a novel watermarking algorithm is proposed for dynamic authentication of IoT signals to detect cyber-attacks. The proposed watermarking algorithm, based on a deep learning long short-term memory structure, enables the IoT devices (IoTDs) to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method enables the IoT gateway, which collects signals from the IoTDs, to effectively authenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT scenarios, since the gateway cannot authenticate all of the IoTDs simultaneously due to computational limitations, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to improve the gateway's decision making process by predicting vulnerable IoTDs. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived, and the uniqueness of the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive IoT system, due to the large set of available actions for the gateway, the MSNE is shown to be analytically challenging to derive, and thus, a learning algorithm that converges to the MSNE is proposed. Moreover, in order to handle incomplete information scenarios, in which the gateway cannot access the state of the unauthenticated IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to dynamically predict the state of unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the gateway to decide on which IoTDs to authenticate. Simulation results show that with an attack detection delay of under 1 s, the messages can be transmitted from IoTDs with an almost 100% reliability. The results also show that by optimally predicting the set of vulnerable IoTDs, the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm reduces the number of compromised IoTDs by up to 30%, compared to an equal probability baseline.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2878025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8642462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2878025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8642462/08509635.pdf","startPage":"1371","endPage":"1387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Signal Authentication and Security in Massive Internet-of-Things Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8642462/8509635-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Signal Authentication and Security in Massive Internet-of-Things Systems","volume":"67","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8509635/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18453654","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509635/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"OAC-1541105, CNS-1446621 and CNS-CNS-1524634"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Deep Learning for Signal Authentication and Security in Massive Internet-of-Things Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ferdowsikhosrowshah-2878025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127449S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8642462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8642462","articleId":"8509635","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8509639,"authors":[{"name":"Jerdvisanop Chakarothai","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8824008/8509639/chaka-2878077-small.gif","p":["Jerdvisanop Chakarothai (S\u201906\u2013M\u201910) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Akita University, Akita, Japan, in 2003, and the M.E. and D.E. degrees in electrical and communication engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","He was a Research Associate with Tohoku University from 2010 to 2011.

In the proposed method, formulation of the fractional derivatives in the time-domain representation is circumvented by using the fast inverse Laplace transform (FILT) and Prony's method. The FILT is used to transform the dispersion expressed in a frequency-domain response into a time-domain response, and Prony's method is utilized to extract the parameters and transform the time-domain responses into those in the z-domain so that they can be incorporated into the FDTD method directly. The update equation of the electric field in the FDTD method is then formulated by using the z-transformation. Stability analysis of the proposed scheme is also investigated by means of the root-locus method. Reflection coefficients of dispersive media, such as Debye, Cole-Cole, Davidson-Cole, and Havriliak-Negami media simulated in a 1-D domain and a three-layered biological medium of skin, fat, and muscle tissues inside a waveguide with a TE10 fundamental mode in a 2-D domain, are found to be in good agreement with those obtained by an analytical method over a broad frequency range,

The proposed input network is formed by a compact broadside coupler and two additional field-effect transistors. By reconfiguring the relative phase offset between the main and auxiliary amplifiers, the DPA can be postoptimized to achieve high efficiency and maximal power gain flatness. More importantly, the DPA can be tuned for the highest performance at different frequencies. To verify the concept, a DPA is fabricated in a 0.15-\u03bcm enhancement mode Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) process and exhibits a measured output power of 26.5 dBm and gain of 11.8 dB at 28 GHz. The peak power-added efficiency (PAE) is 42%, and the PAE at 6-dB output power backoff (PBO) is 31%, respectively. With reconfigurable capability, the DPA can maintain high performance over a 3-GHz frequency band from 26.5 to 29.5 GHz. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed DPA achieves among the highest backoff PAE over a wide bandwidth at Ka-band.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2874249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2874249","startPage":"205","endPage":"215","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8602378/08509649.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8602378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact <i>Ka</i>-Band Integrated Doherty Amplifier With Reconfigurable Input Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Compact <i>Ka</i>-Band Integrated Doherty Amplifier With Reconfigurable Input Network","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","volume":"67","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8509649/","accessionNumber":"18385039","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8509649/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact <italic>Ka</italic>-Band Integrated Doherty Amplifier With Reconfigurable Input Network","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nguyen-2874249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128313S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8602378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8602378","articleId":"8509649","onlineDate":"25 October 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8509864,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Luo","affiliation":["Terahertz Research Centre, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, P.
