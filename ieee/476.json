One of the challenges is to identify genomic markers in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) that are associated with HCC (liver cancer) development by comparing the complete genomic sequences of HBV among patients with HCC and those without HCC. In this study, a data mining framework, which includes molecular evolution analysis, clustering, feature selection, classifier learning, and classification, is introduced. Our research group has collected HBV DNA sequences, either genotype B or C, from over 200 patients specifically for this project. In the molecular evolution analysis and clustering, three subgroups have been identified in genotype C and a clustering method has been developed to separate the subgroups. In the feature selection process, potential markers are selected based on Information Gain for further classifier learning. Then, meaningful rules are learned by our algorithm called the Rule Learning, which is based on Evolutionary Algorithm. Also, a new classification method by Nonlinear Integral has been developed. Good performance of this method comes from the use of the fuzzy measure and the relevant nonlinear integral. The nonadditivity of the fuzzy measure reflects the importance of the feature attributes as well as their interactions. These two classifiers give explicit information on the importance of the individual mutated sites and their interactions toward the classification (potential causes of liver cancer in our case). A thorough comparison study of these two methods with existing methods is detailed. For genotype B, genotype C subgroups C1, C2, and C3, important mutation markers (sites) have been found, respectively. These two classification methods have been applied to classify never-seen-before examples for validation. The results show that the classification methods have more than 70 percent accuracy and 80 percent sensitivity for most data sets, which are considered high as an initial scanning method for liver cancer diagnosis.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2009.6","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/5686865/04760134.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2009.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686865","startPage":"428","endPage":"440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Mining on DNA Sequences of Hepatitis B Virus","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data Mining on DNA Sequences of Hepatitis B Virus","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","accessionNumber":"11742946","pubMedId":"21233523","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/4760134/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Mining on DNA Sequences of Hepatitis B Virus","sourcePdf":"ttb2011020428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.312413S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"5686865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5686865","articleId":"4760134","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4760137,"authors":[{"name":"Heumpil Cho","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4877616/4760137/4760137-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heumpil Cho received the BS degree in electrical engineering and the MS degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, in 1998, 2000, and 2006, respectively.

Previously, adder designs based on conventional designs were examined for implementation with QCA technology. That work demonstrated that the design trade-offs are very different in QCA. This paper utilizes the unique QCA characteristics to design a carry flow adder that is fast and efficient. Simulations indicate very attractive performance (i.e., complexity, area, and delay).

Our approach assumes that the Web service interfaces are defined with Web service description language (WSDL) and the algorithm combines the analysis of their structures and the analysis of the terms used inside them. The higher the similarity, the less are the differences among their interfaces. As a consequence, Urbe is useful when we need to find a Web service suitable to replace an existing one that fails. Especially in autonomic systems, this situation is very common since we need to ensure the self-management, the self-configuration, the self-optimization, the self-healing, and the self-protection of the application that is based on the failed Web service. A semantic-oriented variant of the approach is also proposed, where we take advantage of annotations semantically enriching WSDL specifications. Semantic Annotation for WSDL (SAWSDL) is adopted as a language to annotate a WSDL description. The Urbe approach has been implemented in a prototype that extends a universal description, discovery and integration (UDDI) compliant Web service registry.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.35","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5255973/04760142.pdf","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5255973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"URBE: Web Service Retrieval Based on Similarity Evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"URBE: Web Service Retrieval Based on Similarity Evaluation","volume":"21","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879791","htmlLink":"/document/4760142/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"URBE: Web Service Retrieval Based on Similarity Evaluation","sourcePdf":"ttk2009111629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117026S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5255973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"5255973","articleId":"4760142","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4760148,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Ozuysal","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5392960/4760148/4760148-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mustafa \u00d6zuysal received the BSc degree in electrical and electronics engineering in 2002 and the MSc degree in computer vision from Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey.

To recognize the patches surrounding keypoints, our classifier uses hundreds of simple binary features and models class posterior probabilities.

However, detailed studies based on empirical data are rare. In this paper, we analyze the fault and failure data from two large, real-world case studies. Specifically, we explore: 1) the localization of faults that lead to individual software failures and 2) the distribution of different types of software faults. Our results show that individual failures are often caused by multiple faults spread throughout the system. This observation is important since it does not support several heuristics and assumptions used in the past. In addition, it clearly indicates that finding and fixing faults that lead to such software failures in large, complex systems are often difficult and challenging tasks despite the advances in software development. Our results also show that requirement faults, coding faults, and data problems are the three most common types of software faults. Furthermore, these results show that contrary to the popular belief, a significant percentage of failures are linked to late life cycle activities. Another important aspect of our work is that we conduct intra- and interproject comparisons, as well as comparisons with the findings from related studies. The consistency of several main trends across software systems in this paper and several related research efforts suggests that these trends are likely to be intrinsic characteristics of software faults and failures rather than project specific.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2009.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/5186358/04760152.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5186358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2009.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common Trends in Software Fault and Failure Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Common Trends in Software Fault and Failure Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760152/","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10802350","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760152/","volume":"35","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common Trends in Software Fault and Failure Data","sourcePdf":"tts2009040484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081925S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"5186358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5186358","articleId":"4760152","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4760196,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Schenato","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Schenato","id":"37265689800"},{"name":"Marco Santagiustina","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Santagiustina","id":"37266801600"},{"name":"Carlo G.

The different polarization rotation along the fiber for the signal, the idler, and the pump reduces the amplifier mean gain and the mean time delay. For small random birefringence, the decrease of the mean delay can be directly imputed to the reduction of the mean gain.

Several methods have been proposed to counteract valumetric attacks, but the common approach to the problem is to take only the linear ones into account. This paper presents an extension to the rational dither modulation (RDM) data-hiding scheme which provides robustness against nonlinear distortions modelled by a power-law attack. The algorithm makes use of proper mapping of the pixel values from the Cartesian to hyperbolic coordinates. This mapping is able to render the problem similar to the classical RDM scheme, since fixed multiplicative scaling is cancelled out while the exponentiation of a nonlinear distortion is transformed into a gain scaling. The validity of the approach has been confirmed by applying the watermarking scheme to Gaussian host and real images; experimental results confirm its intrinsic invariance against the power-law attack. Finally, it will be shown that under the white Gaussian noise addition, the proposed scheme achieves a good bit-error rate (BER). The measured BER is affected by the properties of the embedding domain, as supported by the theoretical analysis given in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2008.2011080","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4782049/04760207.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2008.2011080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","startPage":"25","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperbolic RDM for Nonlinear Valumetric Distortions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hyperbolic RDM for Nonlinear Valumetric Distortions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760207/","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4760207/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10473233","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperbolic RDM for Nonlinear Valumetric Distortions","sourcePdf":"04tifs01-mscagliola-2011080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067765S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4782049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4782049","articleId":"4760207","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4760217,"authors":[{"name":"Silvia Ferrari","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4812115/4760217/4760217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Silvia Ferrari (S'01\u2013M'02\u2013SM'08) received the B.S. degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ.","She is an Assistant Professor of mechanical engineering and materials science with the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Duke University, Durham, NC, where she directs the Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Controls.

The objective is to infer a hidden variable or treasure by selecting a sequence of measurements associated with multiple fixed targets distributed in the sensor workspace. The workspace is represented by a connectivity graph, where each node represents a possible sensor deployment, and the arcs represent possible sensor movements. An additive conditional entropy reduction function is presented to efficiently compute the expected benefit of a measurement sequence over time. Then, the optimal treasure hunt strategy is determined by a novel label-correcting algorithm operating on the connectivity graph.

This paper discusses an approach to minimize the switching loss while meeting a given THD requirement using variable switching frequency schemes (switching schemes with the switching frequency varying within a fundamental period). An optimal switching scheme is proposed based on time-domain current ripple analysis and the calculus of variations. The analysis shows that, to meet the same THD requirement, the optimal scheme has a significant saving on switching loss, compared to the fixed switching frequency scheme and the hysteresis control scheme, in addition to other benefits such as reduced peak switching loss and a spread spectrum of the current harmonics. The optimal scheme has been implemented in a prototype and the experimental results have verified the theoretical analysis. Also, a straightforward design method for designing filter inductors for single-phase converters is provided based on the time-domain current ripple analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","volume":"24","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10571167","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760220/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Variable Switching Frequency Scheme for Reducing Switching Loss in Single-Phase Inverters Based on Time-Domain Ripple Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Variable Switching Frequency Scheme for Reducing Switching Loss in Single-Phase Inverters Based on Time-Domain Ripple Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpel-mao-2009635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080221S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4812316","articleId":"4760220","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4760221,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Khaligh","affiliation":["Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory, Electric Power and Power Electronics Center, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Khaligh","id":"37297731800"},{"name":"Jian Cao","affiliation":["Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory, Electric Power and Power Electronics Center, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Cao","id":"37654452500"},{"name":"Young-Joo Lee","affiliation":["Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory, Electric Power and Power Electronics Center, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Young-Joo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407196400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"4760221","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":188,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5026},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Hybrid power systems","Fuel cells","Voltage","Power system modeling","Uninterruptible power systems","Costs","Inductors","Monitoring","Student members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","switching convertors","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input DC-DC converter topology","multiple-input hybrid energy conversion topology","buck-boost converter","transformer","fixed-frequency switching strategy","device-level simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC\u2013DC converter","energy diversification","multiple-input (MI) converter"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a new multiple-input (MI) hybrid energy conversion topology is presented.

A fixed-frequency switching strategy is considered, and analytical analyses, detailed device-level simulation, and experimental results are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiple-Input DC\u2013DC Converter Topology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2009308","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4812314/04760221.pdf","startPage":"862","endPage":"868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2009308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Multiple-Input DC\u2013DC Converter Topology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4760221/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10586837","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiple-Input DC\u2013DC Converter Topology","sourcePdf":"tpel-khaligh-2009308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042606S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"4812314","articleId":"4760221","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4760222,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hsiang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4812316/4760222/4760222-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Hsiang Lin was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1984.

The amount of transient revision is proportional to transient state output voltage variation and load condition. In addition, a dynamic push-pull technique is used to enhance transient response.

However, a tough problem of this new technology is that too many images to be inspected by eyes cause a huge burden to physicians, so it is significant to investigate computerized diagnosis methods.

This new system exploits color texture feature, an important clue used by physicians, to analyze status of gastrointestinal tract. We put forward a new idea of chrominance moment as the color part of color texture feature, which makes full use of Tchebichef polynomials and illumination invariant of hue/saturation/intensity color space. Combined with uniform local binary pattern, a current texture representation model, it can be applied to discriminate normal regions and bleeding regions in CE images. Classification of bleeding regions using multilayer perceptron neural network is then deployed to verify performance of the proposed color texture features.

First, an iterative Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is applied in the endmember searching process to replace the matrix determinant calculation used in N-FINDR, which makes this algorithm run very fast and can also guarantee the stability of its final results. Second, with the set of orthogonal bases obtained by the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, the algorithm can also help to estimate the proper number of endmembers and unmix the original images by itself. In addition, unlike the N-FINDR, a dimensionality reduction transform is not necessary in this algorithm. Experimental results of both simulated images and practical remote sensing images demonstrate that this algorithm is a fast and accurate algorithm for the decomposition of mixed pixels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Bases Approach for the Decomposition of Mixed Pixels in Hyperspectral Imagery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.2010529","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4814847/04760235.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.2010529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Bases Approach for the Decomposition of Mixed Pixels in Hyperspectral Imagery","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4760235/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572760","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Bases Approach for the Decomposition of Mixed Pixels in Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"lgrs-wang-2010529.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067901S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4814847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4814847","articleId":"4760235","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4760240,"authors":[{"name":"Yannis Kopsinis","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4799349/4760240/4760240-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yannis Kopsinis (M'98) was born in Patra, Greece, in 1973.

This problem has been widely studied in a number of works during the past decade for frequency-selective channels, and recently for the more general multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case, for which the state-of-the art results are valid only for nonsingular square channel matrices. Surprisingly, these results do not hold true when the channel matrices are rectangular and/or rank deficient matrices. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete characterization of the MIMO game for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">arbitrary</i>\n channel matrices, in terms of conditions guaranteeing both the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and the convergence of asynchronous distributed iterative waterfilling algorithms. Our analysis hinges on new technical intermediate results, such as a new expression for the MIMO waterfilling projection valid (also) for singular matrices, a mean-value theorem for complex matrix-valued functions, and a general contraction theorem for the multiuser MIMO watefilling mapping valid for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">arbitrary</i>\n channel matrices. The quite surprising result is that uniqueness/convergence conditions in the case of tall (possibly singular) channel matrices are more restrictive than those required in the case of (full rank) fat channel matrices. We also propose a modified game and algorithm with milder conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibrium and convergence, and virtually the same performance (in terms of Nash equilibria) of the original game.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4814882/04760244.pdf","startPage":"1917","endPage":"1935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2013894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2013894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The MIMO Iterative Waterfilling Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Iterative algorithms","Convergence","Mutual information","Interference channels","Game theory","Frequency","Art","Nash equilibrium","Fasteners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Gaussian channels","interference (signal)","iterative methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO iterative waterfilling algorithm","noncooperative maximization","vector Gaussian interference channel","game theory","frequency-selective channels","multiple-input multiple-output case","nonsingular square channel matrices","rank deficient matrices","arbitrary channel matrices","Nash equilibrium","mean-value theorem","complex matrix-valued functions","singular matrices","general contraction theorem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game theory","MIMO Gaussian interference channel","Nash equilibrium","totally asynchronous algorithms","waterfilling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"The MIMO Iterative Waterfilling Algorithm","volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4760244/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10572968","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The MIMO Iterative Waterfilling Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tsp-scutari-2013894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122509S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4814882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"4814882","articleId":"4760244","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4760248,"authors":[{"name":"Carey R.

The first version of active electrode involved direct attachment of surface-mountable components to a textile screen-printed circuit using polymer thick film techniques. The second version involved attaching a much smaller, thinner, and less obtrusive interposer containing the active electrode circuitry to a simplified textile circuit. These designs explored techniques for electronic textile interconnection, chip attachment to textiles, and packaging of circuits on textiles for durability. The results from ECG tests indicate that the performance of each active electrode is comparable to commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes. The interposer-based active electrodes survived a five-cycle washing test while maintaining good signal integrity.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2012408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/4797995/04760248.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2012408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabric-Based Active Electrode Design and Fabrication for Health Monitoring Clothing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fabric-Based Active Electrode Design and Fabrication for Health Monitoring Clothing","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10503094","pubMedId":"19174357","htmlLink":"/document/4760248/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabric-Based Active Electrode Design and Fabrication for Health Monitoring Clothing","sourcePdf":"titb-merritt-2012408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047788S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"4797995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4797995","articleId":"4760248","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4760250,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng-Guang Hou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4812115/4760250/4760250-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zeng-Guang Hou (M'05) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from Yanshan University (formerly North-East Heavy Machinery Institute), Qinhuangdao, China, in 1991 and 1993, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1997.","From May 1997 to June 1999, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Laboratory of Systems and Control, Institute of Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing.

Compared with the previous work, the agent's dynamics includes the uncertainties and external disturbances, which is more practical in real-world applications. Due to the approximation capability of neural networks, the uncertain dynamics is compensated by the adaptive neural network scheme. The effects of the approximation error and external disturbances are counteracted by employing the robustness signal. The proposed algorithm is decentralized because the controller for each agent only utilizes the information of its neighbor agents. By the theoretical analysis, it is proved that the consensus error can be reduced as small as desired. The proposed method is then extended to two cases: agents form a prescribed formation, and agents have the higher order dynamics. Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007810","startPage":"636","endPage":"647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4812115/04760250.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Robust Adaptive Control for the Multiagent System Consensus Problem Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Robust Adaptive Control for the Multiagent System Consensus Problem Using Neural Networks","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560650","pubMedId":"19174350","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4760250/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Robust Adaptive Control for the Multiagent System Consensus Problem Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-hou-2007810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085884S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4812115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"415","xplore-issue":"4812115","articleId":"4760250","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4760254,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias J.

In the first phase we have the classical multiple-access channel where both nodes transmit a message to the relay node, which then decodes the messages. In the second phase the relay broadcasts a re-encoded composition of them based on the network coding idea. This means that each receiving node uses the same data stream to infer on its intended message. We characterize the optimal transmit strategy for the broadcast phase where either the relay node or the two other nodes are equipped with multiple antennas. Our main result shows that beamforming into the subspace spanned by the channels is always an optimal transmit strategy for the multiple-input single-output bidirectional broadcast channel. Thereby, it shows that correlation between the channels is advantageous. Moreover, this leads to a parametrization of the optimal transmit strategy which specifies the whole capacity region. In retrospect the results are intuitively clear since the single-beam transmit strategy reflects the single stream processing due to the network coding approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2013900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4814882/04760254.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2013900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814882","startPage":"1948","endPage":"1958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiantenna Bidirectional Broadcast Channels\u2014 Optimal Transmit Strategies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiantenna Bidirectional Broadcast Channels\u2014 Optimal Transmit Strategies","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10572986","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4760254/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiantenna Bidirectional Broadcast Channels\u2014 Optimal Transmit Strategies","sourcePdf":"tsp-wyrembelski-2013900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102504S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4814882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4814882","articleId":"4760254","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4760256,"authors":[{"name":"Yue M.

Our discussions center around how to develop practical computation algorithms based on the proposed analytical condition. We address several issues along this line, including the derivation of simple closed-form expressions for the Fourier transforms of the indicator functions defined on arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral domains; a complete and nonredundant enumeration of all quantized sampling lattices via the Hermite normal forms of integer matrices; and a quantitative analysis of the approximation of the original infinite Fourier condition by using finite computations. Combining these results, we propose a computational testing procedure that can efficiently search for the optimal alias-free sampling lattices for a given polygonal or polyhedral shaped frequency domain. Several examples are presented to show the potential of the proposed algorithm in multidimensional filter bank design, as well as in applications involving the design of efficient sampling patterns for multidimensional band-limited signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4760256/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10572989","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Computable Fourier Condition Generating Alias-Free Sampling Lattices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computable Fourier Condition Generating Alias-Free Sampling Lattices","sourcePdf":"tsp-lu-2013904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216377S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4814882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4814882","articleId":"4760256","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4760257,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang-Xin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhang-Xin","lastName":"Chen","id":"38183881600"},{"name":"He-Wen Wei","affiliation":["Southwest Electronics and Telecommunication Technology Research Institute, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"He-Wen","lastName":"Wei","id":"37293599500"},{"name":"Qun Wan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Wan","id":"37273394600"},{"name":"Shang-Fu Ye","affiliation":["Southwest Electronics and Telecommunication Technology Research Institute, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shang-Fu","lastName":"Ye","id":"37287773000"},{"name":"Wan-Lin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wan-Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37276963100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4760257","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Signal processing algorithms","Performance analysis","Gaussian processes","Intelligent transportation systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Noise measurement","Wireless communication","Emergency services","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional scaling framework","mobile location","Gaussian-Markov theorem","weighted MDS analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile localization","multidimensional scaling (MDS)","time-of-arrival"]}],"abstract":"Recently, while the classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm had been claimed to be infeasible, MDS based algorithms, including modified MDS and subspace approach, have been applied to the range measurements based mobile localization.

We start by modeling a noncooperative pure pricing game among multiple competing retailers who sell a certain branded product under price-dependent stochastic demands. A unique Nash equilibrium is proven to exist under some mild conditions. We demonstrate mathematically the incentives for retailers to start a price war. Based on a strategic framework via the game theory, we illustrate the use of service level to build price walls which can prevent a huge drop in price, as well as profit. Three kinds of price walls are proposed, and the respective strengths and weaknesses have been studied. Analytical conditions, under which a price wall can effectively prevent big drops in both market share and profit, are developed. Aside from the proposed price walls, two other pricing strategies, which can lead to an all-win situation, are examined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","volume":"39","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10475330","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760264/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Price Wall or War: The Pricing Strategies for Retailers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Price Wall or War: The Pricing Strategies for Retailers","sourcePdf":"tsmca-choi-2010753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09939S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4785249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4785249","articleId":"4760264","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4760269,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayu Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA","Center of In Vivo Microscopy, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jiayu Song photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jiayu","lastName":"Song","id":"37654321000"},{"name":"Yanhui Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4909410/4760269/4760269-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yanhui Liu received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering in 2004 from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Sichuan, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Since September 2007, he has been a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC.

The objective of this paper is to develop a reconstruction technique in high dimensions with on-the-fly kernel calculation. It implements general multidimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) algorithms and incorporates them into a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-space image reconstruction framework.

Performance comparisons are made against the conventional Kaiser-Bessel (KB) gridding method for 2-D and 3-D radially encoded computer-simulated phantoms and physically scanned phantoms. The results show that the NUFFT reconstruction method has better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff than the KB gridding method when the kernel weights are calculated on the fly. It is found that for a particular conventional kernel function, using its corresponding deapodization function as a scaling factor in the NUFFT framework has the potential to improve accuracy. In particular, when a cosine scaling factor is used, the NUFFT method is faster than KB gridding method since a closed-form solution is available and is less computationally expensive than the KB kernel (KB griding requires computation of Bessel functions).

Discriminant analysis was used to identify the effective scales of the intrinsic-mode functions and the window length for the calculation of the IMEn that contributes to the efficient classification of the GSL signs. Experimental results from the IMEn analysis applied to GSL signs corresponding to 60-word lexicon repeated ten times by three native signers have shown more than 93% mean classification accuracy using IMEn as the only source of the classification feature set.

At present, the motion of these wireless endoscopic devices cannot be controlled and they proceed by means of visceral peristalsis and gravity. Aimed at enabling a motion control, the technique described here uses an external magnetic field applied to the video capsule, previously coated with a magnetic shell. As a source of controlled magnetic field, a robotic magnetic navigation system, recently introduced in the clinical practice to magnetically steer cardiovascular interventional devices, was suggested in a previous study to be deserving of investigation. The attractive potentialities of this system, along with its current limitations, in order to maneuver endoscopic capsules were studied in this work for the first time, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view. The actual capabilities were experimentally assessed with preliminary motion control tests on a conventional video capsule inside a human-sized plastic phantom. Results demonstrated the possibility of achieving controlled magnetic maneuvers within the considered environment.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4976166/04760277.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2013336","startPage":"1482","endPage":"1490","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2013336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Maneuvering of Endoscopic Capsules by Means of a Robotic Navigation System","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4760277/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10666109","pubMedId":"19174328","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Maneuvering of Endoscopic Capsules by Means of a Robotic Navigation System","sourcePdf":"tbme-carpi-2013336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149717S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4976166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4976166","articleId":"4760277","onlineDate":"23 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4760422,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Garg","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Grid Computing and Distributed Systems Laboratory, CSSE, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Garg","id":"37652310100"},{"name":"Pramod Konugurthi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Grid Computing and Distributed Systems Laboratory, CSSE, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Konugurthi","id":"37659502800"},{"name":"Rajkumar Buyya","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Grid Computing and Distributed Systems Laboratory, CSSE, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Buyya","id":"37267557900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2962-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4760422","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760422","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Genetic algorithms","Costs","Processor scheduling","Grid computing","Scheduling algorithm","Laboratories","Computer science","Software engineering","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","grid computing","integer programming","linear programming","minimisation","quality of service","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["utility grid computing","linear programming","genetic algorithm","meta-scheduling","user-level broker","QoS requirement","cost minimization","NP-hard problem","integer programming","resource utilization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760422","endPage":"26","startPage":"19","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753887/4760394/04760422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Linear Programming Driven Genetic Algorithm for Meta-Scheduling on Utility Grids","abstract":"The user-level brokers in grids consider individual application QoS requirements and minimize their cost without considering demands from other users. This results in contention for resources and sub-optimal schedules. Meta-scheduling in grids aims to address this scheduling problem, which is NP hard due to its combinatorial nature. Thus, many heuristic-based solutions using genetic algorithm (GA) have been proposed, apart from traditional algorithms such as greedy and FCFS. We propose a Linear Programming/Integer Programming model (LP/IP) for scheduling these applications to multiple resources. We also propose a novel algorithm LPGA (linear programming driven genetic algorithm) which combines the capabilities of LP and GA. The aim of this algorithm is to obtain the best meta-schedule for utility grids which minimize combined cost of all users in a coordinated manner. Simulation results show that our proposed integrated algorithm offers the best schedule having the minimum processing cost with negligible time overheard.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760422/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760422/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10401238","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Linear Programming Driven Genetic Algorithm for Meta-Scheduling on Utility Grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linear Programming Driven Genetic Algorithm for Meta-Scheduling on Utility Grids","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM08-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063818S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753887","isNumber":"4760394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753887","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4760394","articleId":"4760422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4760429,"authors":[{"name":"Chetana Hegde","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore, India","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Chetana","lastName":"Hegde","id":"37663644900"},{"name":"S Manu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Manu","id":"37085988293"},{"name":"P Deepa Shenoy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore, India","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"P Deepa","lastName":"Shenoy","id":"38559396000"},{"name":"K R Venugopal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore 560 001, India"],"firstName":"K R","lastName":"Venugopal"},{"name":"L M Patnaik","affiliation":["Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Deemed University, Pune, India"],"firstName":"L M","lastName":"Patnaik","id":"37268541000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2962-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4760429","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1561},"abstract":"Core banking is a set of services provided by a group of networked bank branches. Bank customers may access their funds and perform other simple transactions from any of the member branch offices. The major issue in core banking is the authenticity of the customer. Due to unavoidable hacking of the databases on the Internet, it is always quite difficult to trust the information on the Internet. To solve this problem of authentication, we are proposing an algorithm based on image processing and visual cryptography. This paper proposes a technique of processing the signature of a customer and then dividing it into shares. Total number of shares to be created is depending on the scheme chosen by the bank. When two shares are created, one is stored in the bank database and the other is kept by the customer. The customer has to present the share during all of his transactions. This share is stacked with the first share to get the original signature. The correlation method is used to take the decision on acceptance or rejection of the output and authenticate the customer.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753887/4760394/04760429.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Authentication using Image Processing and Visual Cryptography for Banking Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Image processing","Cryptography","Banking","Image databases","Transaction databases","Visual databases","Internet","Computer crime","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bank data processing","cryptography","image coding","image processing","Internet","message authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["banking application","image processing","visual cryptography","core banking","bank customers","customer authenticity","Internet","bank database","correlation method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Secure Authentication using Image Processing and Visual Cryptography for Banking Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760429/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401245","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Authentication using Image Processing and Visual Cryptography for Banking Applications","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM08-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067158S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753887","isNumber":"4760394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753887","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4760394","articleId":"4760429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4760433,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Most of Web users use various search engines to get specific information. A key factor in the success of Web search engines are their ability to rapidly find good quality results to the queries that are based on specific terms. This paper aims at retrieving more relevant documents from a huge corpus based on the required information. We propose a text mining framework that consists of four distinct stages: 1.

In OFDMA systems, multiple access is achieved by assigning subsets of orthogonal subcarriers to individual users. Hence these systems are less sensitive to inter symbol interference. However, the orthogonality between users' codes is often disturbed by the carrier frequency offset due to the Doppler effect in fading channels, time delay due to multipath components and poor synchronization at the receiver. This offset results in interference between users in the system. In this paper, a fuzzy based multiuser interference cancellation scheme has been proposed for OFDMA systems. Monte Carlo simulations have been run to simulate the performance of the proposed interference cancellation scheme. It is observed from the results that the proposed scheme outperforms those available in the literature in terms of less bit error rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Based Interference Cancellation Scheme for OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760434","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753887/4760394/04760434.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Based Interference Cancellation Scheme for OFDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760434/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401250","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Based Interference Cancellation Scheme for OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM08-00-40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041763S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753887","isNumber":"4760394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753887","xplore-issue":"4760394","articleId":"4760434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4760435,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The code division multiple access system with time division duplex mode (TDD-CDMA), adopting unbalanced slot allocation between uplink and downlink, is a good solution for this traffic asymmetry. Here a QoS adaptive multimedia service framework is proposed to control the multimedia traffic in TDD-CDMA cellular wireless networks. The scheme operates at the connection-level where the CDMA code of ongoing call can be dynamically changed to provide an acceptable trade off level between connection blocking and dropping probabilities for different traffic class. The proposed scheme is designed to take advantage of the adaptive code allocation algorithm in order to enhance the system utilization, and blocking & dropping probabilities of calls. Although orthogonal variable frequency spreading (OVSF) code is used in simulation here, the paramount interest is on algorithm that allows optimum use of TDD-CDMA resources i.e. code and time slots. Simulation result shows that on the expense of resource allocated to non real-time services, the call dropping and blocking rate for real-time services can be minimized.","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760449","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753887/4760394/04760449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760394","startPage":"203","endPage":"207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Resource Management for TDD-CDMA Cellular Wireless Multimedia Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Resource Management for TDD-CDMA Cellular Wireless Multimedia Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760449/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401265","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4760449/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Resource Management for TDD-CDMA Cellular Wireless Multimedia Networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM08-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066229S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753887","isNumber":"4760394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753887","xplore-issue":"4760394","articleId":"4760449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4760457,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The integration of power line communication with that of visible light communication is being considered as one such system. The existing integrated system degrades in its performance in the presence of power line noises and additive white Gaussian noise. In this paper a modified integrated system that utilizes the advantage of turbo codes is proposed. Parallel concatenated convolutional codes which are a class of turbo codes have been considered in this paper. The concatenated codes are chosen since they are effective in correcting the burst errors which are more predominant in power line channel. Also in the modified integrated system the effect of multipath in power line channel has been considered. The simulations are done with four paths and their amplitude and phase details were plotted. To further enhance the performance of the system a modified bit error minimization algorithm which is based on the number of iterations has been proposed. The simulation results show that the modified integrated system based on turbo code provides a coding gain of about 6 dB than the existing integrated system.","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760457","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753887/4760394/04760457.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Integrated System under Impulse Noise and Multipath Channel using Turbo Coded OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760457/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Integrated System under Impulse Noise and Multipath Channel using Turbo Coded OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401273","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760457/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Integrated System under Impulse Noise and Multipath Channel using Turbo Coded OFDM","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM08-00-63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044447S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753887","isNumber":"4760394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753887","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4760394","articleId":"4760457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4760474,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Kumar Saxena","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Guru Ghasidas University, Bilaspur, India"],"firstName":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37663303300"},{"name":"Megha Vora","affiliation":["Department of Computer Application, Saint Peters University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Megha","lastName":"Vora","id":"37659085100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2962-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4760474","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760474","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) framework using concepts of small world theory.

In the proposed technique, the position equation of PPSO known as step size is modified to find best matching block in current frame. In the SPMPPSO, small population i.e. five swarms is used to find global optimum value. Due to neighbourhood search criteria (N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>\n), the convergence is very fast. The limitations of existing methods like computational time, search parameter, initial search and search space are overcome by SPMPPSO.

Of course, the design depends on the mobility pattern and delay tolerance as in highly mobile environments, exchange of control signaling bears a huge cost whereas for fixed (non-mobile) networks, the designer can dedicate a fraction of the rate (which is negligible in terms of overhead) to optimize the system. One of the big challenges is to find how to optimally split the intelligence between cognitive terminals and cognitive networks.

Phase-shifted sequences are used for differentiating users. The signals of the GAS-CP-CDMA system experience no (or very little) interferences from co-cell signals because of the good autocorrelation property, but user signals of adjacent cells may yield interferences. The frequency reuse factor in the ordinary CDMA system is around 0.6 and the interference from adjacent cells is about 40 percent of the total interference in the conventional CDMA system. Our numerical analysis shows that the frequency reuse factor and user capacity versus signal-to-noise ratio of the GAS-CP-CDMA system are improved comparing to the conventional CDMA system. The uplink user capacity of the proposed system can be increased up to about twice of that of the conventional CDMA system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4760510/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400813","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Uplink performance analysis of GAS-CP CDMA system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink performance analysis of GAS-CP CDMA system","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03486S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723755","isNumber":"4760486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723755","xplore-issue":"4760486","articleId":"4760510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4760511,"authors":[{"name":"Quoc Trinh Do","affiliation":["Department of Radio-Electronics Engineering, Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Quoc Trinh","lastName":"Do","id":"38253099000"},{"name":"The Cuong Dinh","affiliation":["Department of Radio-Electronics Engineering, Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"The Cuong","lastName":"Dinh","id":"38256823000"},{"name":"Takeshi Hashimoto","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37266621400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2680-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2681-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"4760511","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Labeling","Partitioning algorithms","Convolutional codes","AWGN","Error probability","Communications technology","Transfer functions","Additive white noise","Multidimensional systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","geometric codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","search problems","transfer functions","trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometric uniform code","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","2D trellis code","binary isometric labeling","transfer function","equivalent code subset","search algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Given a signal set whose geometrically uniform (GU) partition allows binary isometric labelings, a GU code C(g,C) is determined by a binary label code C and a binary isometric labeling g.

In this paper, we model the extremely noisy channel environment and propose a time and frequency domain diversity technique for an OFDM based solution. While COFDM based solutions have been implemented in practice for wireless systems, our work shows that in the presence of impulsive noises and colored background noise, FEC may not be the best solution and it is preferable to use simple redundancy in frequency and time domain to achieve reliable data transmission. The proposed system has very low computational complexity and is specifically designed for AMR application in the CENELEC frequency bands A and B.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723755/4760486/04760521.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2008.4760521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2008.4760521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding and diversity schemes for OFDM based narrowband power-line communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Narrowband","Background noise","Automatic meter reading","Working environment noise","Colored noise","Frequency domain analysis","Redundancy","Data communication","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic meter reading","carrier transmission on power lines","channel coding","diversity reception","impulse noise","OFDM modulation","time-frequency analysis","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding scheme","diversity scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","narrowband power-line communication","automatic meter reading","AMR","time varying channel","noisy channel environment","time-frequency domain technique","wireless system","impulsive noise","colored background noise","CENELEC frequency band","electric meter","gas meter","water meter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coding and diversity schemes for OFDM based narrowband power-line communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400820","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding and diversity schemes for OFDM based narrowband power-line communications","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075303S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723755","isNumber":"4760486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723755","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4760486","articleId":"4760521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4760526,"authors":[{"name":"Viet-Ha Pham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Viet-Ha","lastName":"Pham","id":"37408882900"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Chouinard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Chouinard","id":"37274195300"},{"name":"Dominic Grenier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"Grenier","id":"37266095700"},{"name":"Huu-Tue Huynh","affiliation":["Bac-Ha International University, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Huu-Tue","lastName":"Huynh","id":"37266517600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2680-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2681-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"4760526","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Fourier transforms","Kernel","MIMO","Frequency","Algorithm design and analysis","Communications technology","Communication channels","Design optimization","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Fourier transforms","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial channel","system characterization","multi-antenna systems","modern communications systems","wave vector domains","space vector domains","3D Fourier transform","kernel functions","multiple-input multiple-output communications systems","MIMO communications systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760526","abstract":"With the emergence of the multi-antenna systems, the spatial information becomes particularly significant to the modern communications systems.

The extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart is a powerful method for analyzing iteratively decoded codes such as Turbo codes. EXIT charts were introduced as a method for representing how the mutual information between the decoder output and the transmitted bits changes over turbo decoding iterations. It is possible to apply the EXIT chart method to LDPC codes by treating the LDPC decoder as a concatenation of variable and check nodes. However the achieved convergence threshold values obtained with the EXIT charts are (plusmn0.1) dB away from the more precise results derived from the density evolution (DE) method. Subsequently, the EXIT trajectories method was proposed as an improved performance-analysis method for LDPC codes under belief propagation (BP) decoding and achieved more accurate convergence threshold values than the EXIT chart method. In this paper, the EXIT chart and the EXIT trajectories methods are proposed as analysis tools to compare between the BP, log likelihood and max log likelihood decoding algorithms for LDPC codes in terms of convergence thresholds. Furthermore, a comparison between EXIT chart, EXIT trajectories and DE methods is introduced for the mentioned LDPC codes. Simulations and numerical calculations on convergence thresholds for various ensembles of (dv, dc) regular LDPC codes for binary input AWGN channels are performed which results that the BP is the best decoding algorithm for LDPC code followed by the log likelihood and the max log likelihood algorithms, respectively. Also, the EXIT trajectory method yields more accurate results than EXIT charts which come very close to the DE method, while being more convenient numerically as a code research tool than the latter which require many Fourier transform operations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison between BP, log-likelihood and max log-likelihood decoding algorithms of LDPC codes based on EXIT chart and EXIT trajectories methods","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2008.4760552","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723755/4760486/04760552.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2008.4760552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A comparison between BP, log-likelihood and max log-likelihood decoding algorithms of LDPC codes based on EXIT chart and EXIT trajectories methods","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760552/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400844","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison between BP, log-likelihood and max log-likelihood decoding algorithms of LDPC codes based on EXIT chart and EXIT trajectories methods","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081491S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723755","isNumber":"4760486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723755","xplore-issue":"4760486","articleId":"4760552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4760556,"authors":[{"name":"Arun K.

In the ideal case we assume the reference signal is an unwanted sinusoidal signal (the input to our ICA algorithm). In the non-ideal case, we assume the received OFDM signal is contaminated with sinusoidal interference. Simulation results performed at a SNR of 5dB resulted in an error measurement of 0.01812 for wavelet-OFDM and an error of approximately 0.03277 for Fourier-OFDM for the ideal case and for the non-ideal case an error of 0.01817 was measured for wavelet-based OFDM and 0.03167 for Fourier-based OFDM.

The objective of power allocation is to minimize the maximum MSE among all users each of which has limited transmit power. We first show that the problem is a non-linear optimization problem. Using the Lagrange multiplier method, we derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for a power allocation to be optimal. Numerical results indicate that, compared to the minimum total mean square error (MMSE) criterion, the minimax MSE criterion yields a higher total MSE but provides a fairer treatment across the users. The advantages of the minimax MSE criterion are more evident when we consider the bit error rate (BER) estimates. Numerical results show that the minimax MSE criterion yields a lower maximum BER and lower average BER. We also observe that, with the minimax MSE criterion, some users do not transmit at full power. For comparison, with the minimum total MSE criterion, all users transmit at full power.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2008.4760576","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723755/4760486/04760576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2008.4760576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760486","startPage":"281","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint transceiver power allocation with minimax MSE criterion for uplink MC-CDMA transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint transceiver power allocation with minimax MSE criterion for uplink MC-CDMA transmissions","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760576/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400861","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4760576/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint transceiver power allocation with minimax MSE criterion for uplink MC-CDMA transmissions","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045159S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723755","isNumber":"4760486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723755","xplore-issue":"4760486","articleId":"4760576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4760577,"authors":[{"name":"Suhyun Cha","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suhyun Cha","id":"37087656565"},{"name":"Soobin Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Soobin Lee","id":"37087152605"},{"name":"Chang H.

However, the hardware efficient post-delay reconstruction structure suffers from artifact problem when dynamic focusing is applied. A sigma-delta beamformer based on cascaded reconstruction has successfully corrected the artifact problem by reducing the pre-delay quantization noise level. Based on the same principle, we developed a multi-bit SDBF. The multi-bit SDBF provides comparable image quality as the pre-delay reconstruction SDBF without any extra artifact correction processing. It also reduces the operation frequency as well as the power compared to the single-bit SDBF. Real point and cyst phantom images are presented to compare the performance of the proposed beamformer with other existing techniques.

By using an efficient voltage buffer, a low-voltage, low-power, three-stage RNMC amplifier topology suitable for large capacitive load applications is constructed with a noninverting intermediate stage. Moreover, the internal feedback loop introduced by the buffer prevents the reduction in high-frequency gain and extends the bandwidth of the amplifier significantly. Furthermore, a multipath feedforward stage is added to generate a left-half-plane (LHP) zero, which improves the stability of the amplifier and reduces the size of compensation capacitors simultaneously. An optimized MRNMCVB amplifier has been implemented in a 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS process. The amplifier driving a 500-pF load capacitor achieves 1.76-MHz unity-gain frequency (UGF), 59\u00b0 phase margin, and 0.88-V/\u03bcs average slew rate, while dissipating only 45-\u03bcW power at a 1.5-V supply.

However, it requires highly reliable clock synchronization between the internal and external system, leading to the design extremely difficult. To solve this problem, a new data encoding method based on pulse width modulation is presented in this paper to make the internal and external modules can work at asynchronous system clocks with a clock detector designed to make the internal device fit the different clock frequencies. The new coding method is shown to be successful by a board circuit system and the testing results.","doi":"10.1109/EDSSC.2008.4760682","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749246/4760628/04760682.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDSSC.2008.4760682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New data coding method for wireless command transmission BPSK modulator in implantable neural signal acquisition system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760682/","displayDocTitle":"A New data coding method for wireless command transmission BPSK modulator in implantable neural signal acquisition system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401059","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760682/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New data coding method for wireless command transmission BPSK modulator in implantable neural signal acquisition system","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01192009-00054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041145S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749246","isNumber":"4760628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749246","xplore-issue":"4760628","articleId":"4760682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4760687,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed two-stage OTA is a A/AB class that combines a novel rail-to-rail folded-cascode as the first-stage with active current mirrors as the second stage. Due to the AB class operation in the second stage, slew limiting only occurs in the first stage, So, it cause lower power dissipation for SC circuits. Also, it employs the cascode compensation scheme for fast settling. Using the proposed methodology, the optimum values for the op-amp device sizes of all stages are determined in order to optimize all of the characteristics. Trade-offs among such factors as bias-current, speed, noise and power-dissipation are made evident.

The implementation of new materials and devices architectures will be necessary. HiK gate dielectric and metal gate are among the most strategic options to reduce power consumption and manage low supply voltage. Multigate architectures increase MOSFETs drivability, reduce power, and allow new memory devices opportunities for future applications. By introducing new materials(HiK, Ge, III-V, Carbon based materials like diamond, graphene and CNTs, molecules,...), and new function such as sensing and actuation allowing to interface the outside world (M/NEMS, filters, Imagers,...) Si based CMOS will be scaled beyond the ITRS as the System-on-Chip/Wafer Platform. The Heterogeneous integration of these devices with CMOS will require new 3D and Packaging schemes leading to the increase of effective packing density, improving systems figures of merit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New routes and diversifications ofr nanoelectronics by the end of the roadmap and beyond","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/EDSSC.2008.4760730","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749246/4760628/04760730.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDSSC.2008.4760730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"New routes and diversifications ofr nanoelectronics by the end of the roadmap and beyond","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760730/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401103","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New routes and diversifications ofr nanoelectronics by the end of the roadmap and beyond","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01192009-00102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097407S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749246","isNumber":"4760628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749246","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4760628","articleId":"4760730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4760731,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Key advantages of CMOS image sensors are that they are fabricated in standard CMOS technologies, which allow full integration of the image sensor along with the analog and digital processing and control circuits on the same chip and that they are of low cost. Since there is a practical limit on the minimum pixel size (4~5 mum), then CMOS technology scaling can allow for an increased number of transistors to be integrated into the pixel. Such smart pixels truly show the potential of CMOS technology in imaging applications, especially for high-speed applications. This work discusses various active-pixel sensors (APS) and shows the feasibility of using the DC-level to increase the sensitivity of the pixel for low-level light applications. Avalanche-photodiodes (APDs) are described, in addition to a discussion of the breakdown mechanism and microplasma in avalanche breakdown for single photon APDs. A fully integrated, 16 times 16 pixel CMOS camera-on-a-chip, fabricated in a standard CMOS 0.18 mum technology is also shown in this work. The array is based on 256 APS with a pixel size of 20 mum times 30 mum, a fill-factor of 60% with all digital and analog blocks implemented on-chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749246/4760628/04760731.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/EDSSC.2008.4760731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDSSC.2008.4760731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS image sensors and camera-on-a-chip for low-light level biomedical applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","CMOS technology","Avalanche breakdown","Charge-coupled image sensors","Biosensors","Charge coupled devices","Biomedical imaging","CMOS digital integrated circuits","CMOS analog integrated circuits","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche breakdown","avalanche photodiodes","biomedical equipment","biomedical optical imaging","CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","camera-on-a-chip","low-light level applications","biomedical applications","active-pixel sensors","charge-coupled device imaging","standard CMOS technologies","analog processing","digital processing","control circuits","CMOS technology scaling","transistors","high-speed applications","avalanche-photodiodes","microplasma","avalanche breakdown","fill-factor","optical molecular imaging systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"CMOS image sensors and camera-on-a-chip for low-light level biomedical applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401104","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS image sensors and camera-on-a-chip for low-light level biomedical applications","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01192009-00103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05584S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749246","isNumber":"4760628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749246","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4760628","articleId":"4760731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4760742,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Fat Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chi Fat Chan","id":"37406800300"},{"name":"Siu-Kei Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Siu-Kei","lastName":"Tang","id":"37414654700"},{"name":"Kong-Pang Pun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Kong-Pang Pun","id":"37270102800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2539-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2540-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4760742","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","OFDM","Phase noise","Frequency synthesizers","Topology","Varactors","MOS devices","1f noise","Voltage","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband OFDM UWB systems","CMOS process","frequency 1 MHz","frequency 3.1 GHz to 4.1 GHz","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1.5 V","voltage 1 V","power 4.7 mW"]}],"abstract":"A 4-GHz VCO for Multiband OFDM ultra-wide-band system is presented.

This last criterion is essential when aiming at detecting also weaker reflections.

It is proposed to first pre-process the raw data and then to apply a suitable compression technique like back-propagation neural network whose on-board implementation would be efficient both in terms of speed and power.","startPage":"380","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"2008 European Radar Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760754","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753943/4760754/04760881.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-board SAR compression system based on back-propagation neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760881/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On-board SAR compression system based on back-propagation neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760881/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10415681","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"30-31 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-board SAR compression system based on back-propagation neural network","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"SPI-01202009-00127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035425S","chronDate":"30-31 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753943","isNumber":"4760754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753943","xplore-issue":"4760754","articleId":"4760881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Assoc.EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCI","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4760987,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Bian","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wei Bian","id":"37604666100"},{"name":"Dacheng Tao","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dacheng Tao","id":"37269935500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4760987","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"abstract":"Under the homoscedastic Gaussian assumption, it has been shown that Fisherpsilas linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) suffers from the class separation problem when the dimensionality of subspace selected by FLDA is strictly less than the class number minus 1, i.e., the projection to a subspace tends to merge close class pairs. A recent result shows that maximizing the geometric mean of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences of class pairs can significantly reduce this problem. In this paper, to further reduce the class separation problem, the harmonic mean is applied to replace the geometric mean for subspace selection. The new method is termed maximization of the harmonic mean of all pairs of symmetric KL divergences (MHMD). As MHMD is invariant to rotational transformations, an efficient optimization procedure can be conducted on the Grassmann manifold. Thorough empirical studies demonstrate the effective of harmonic mean in dealing with the class separation problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04760987.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4760987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4760987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4760987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic mean for subspace selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear discriminant analysis","Mathematical analysis","Constraint optimization","Machine learning algorithms","Manifolds","Image databases","Machine learning","Harmonic analysis","Performance analysis","Merging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","geometry","harmonic analysis","optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic mean","subspace selection","homoscedastic Gaussian assumption","Fisher linear discriminant analysis","Kullback-Leibler divergence","geometric mean","rotational transformation","Grassmann manifold","optimization procedure","class separation problem","maximization","divergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic mean for subspace selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760987/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457614","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic mean for subspace selection","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047598S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4760987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4760990,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yuan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electron.

Among the various motion-detection techniques, background subtraction methods are commonly implemented, especially for applications relying on a fixed camera. Since the basic inter-frame difference with global threshold is often a too simplistic method, more elaborate (and often probabilistic) methods have been proposed. These methods often aim at making the detection process more robust to noise, background motion and camera jitter. In this paper, we present commonly-implemented background subtraction algorithms and we evaluate them quantitatively. In order to gauge performances of each method, tests are performed on a wide range of real, synthetic and semi-synthetic video sequences representing different challenges.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4760998/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4760998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444200","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Review and Evaluation of Commonly-Implemented Background Subtraction Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review and Evaluation of Commonly-Implemented Background Subtraction Algorithms","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059984S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4760998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4761037,"authors":[{"name":"Loic Lacheze","affiliation":["ISIR, FRE2507, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, France"],"firstName":"Loic","lastName":"Lacheze","id":"37681643500"},{"name":"Ryad Benosman","affiliation":["ISIR, FRE2507, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, France"],"firstName":"Ryad","lastName":"Benosman","id":"38532062400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761037","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sampling","Entropy","Data mining","Robustness","Nonhomogeneous media","Partitioning algorithms","Topology","Object recognition","Feature extraction","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","image sampling","quadtrees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive image patch sampling technique","entropy method","optimal multilayer quadtree decomposition","object recognition","robust localization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761037","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761037.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image sampling for localization using entropy","abstract":"This paper introduces a robust adaptive patches sampling technique.

The matrix-representation model defines the pixel in color face image as the basic unit, the color information of the pixel as the basic component, and then represents the color face image efficiently in the format of matrix. Based on the representation model, color-Eigenfaces are computed for feature extraction using 2DPCA. Nearest neighborhood classification approach is adopted to identify the color face samples. Experimental results on CVL and CMU PIE color face database show the good performance of the proposed color face recognition approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761093.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color face recognition based on 2DPCA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Feature extraction","Pixel","Image recognition","Covariance matrix","Principal component analysis","Sparse matrices","Educational institutions","Image databases","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color face recognition","2DPCA","matrix-representation model","color-Eigenfaces","feature extraction","nearest neighborhood classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Color face recognition based on 2DPCA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761093/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444291","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color face recognition based on 2DPCA","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13088S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4761094,"authors":[{"name":"Serkan Kiranyaz","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Serkan","lastName":"Kiranyaz","id":"37397595000"},{"name":"Turker Ince","affiliation":["Izmir University of Economics, Izmir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Turker","lastName":"Ince","id":"37397595100"},{"name":"Alper Yildirim","affiliation":["TUBITAK, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Alper","lastName":"Yildirim","id":"37567585500"},{"name":"Moncef Gabbouj","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Moncef","lastName":"Gabbouj","id":"37276556200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761094","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761094","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Particle swarm optimization","Feedforward systems","Space technology","Multidimensional systems","Encoding","Evolutionary computation","Genetic algorithms","Genetic programming","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional particle swarm optimization","optimal network configuration","artificial neural network","unsupervised design","multidimensional search space"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761094","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761094.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised design of Artificial Neural Networks via multi-dimensional Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel and efficient approach for automatic design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) by evolving to the optimal network configuration(s) within an architecture space. The evolution technique, the so-called multidimensional particle swarm optimization (MD PSO) re-forms the native structure of PSO particles in such a way that they can make inter-dimensional passes with a dedicated dimensional PSO process. So in a multidimensional search space where the optimum dimension is unknown, swarm particles can seek for both positional and dimensional optima. This eventually removes the necessity of setting a fixed dimension a priori, which is a common drawback for the family of swarm optimizers. With the proper encoding of the network configurations and parameters into particles, MD PSO can then seek for positional optimum in the error space and dimensional optimum in the architecture space. The optimum dimension converged at the end of a MD PSO process corresponds to a unique ANN configuration where the network parameters (connections, weights and biases) can then be resolved from the positional optimum reached on that dimension. The efficiency and performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated over one of the hardest synthetic problems. The experimental results show that MD PSO evolves to optimum or near-optimum networks in general.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761094/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10444292","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761094/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised design of Artificial Neural Networks via multi-dimensional Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised design of Artificial Neural Networks via multi-dimensional Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04549S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4761098,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The filter enhances objects similar to a model employed in the filter; e.g., a blob enhancement filter based on the Hessian matrix enhances sphere-like objects. Actual lesions, however, often differ from a simple model, e.g., a lung nodule is generally modeled as a solid sphere, but there are nodules of various shapes and with inhomogeneities inside such as a spiculated one and a ground-glass opacity. Thus, conventional filters often fail to enhance actual lesions. Our purpose in this study was to develop a supervised filter for enhancement of lesions by use of a massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) in a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) scheme for detection of lung nodules in CT. The MTANN filter was trained with actual nodules in CT images to enhance actual patterns of nodules. By use of the MTANN filter, the sensitivity and specificity of our CAD scheme were improved substantially. With the database with 69 lung cancers, our CAD scheme with the MTANN filter achieve a 97% sensitivity with 6.7 false positives (FPs) per section, whereas a conventional CAD scheme with a difference-image technique achieved a 96% sensitivity with 19.3 FPs per section.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761114/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10444311","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761114/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Supervised enhancement of lung nodules by use of a massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised enhancement of lung nodules by use of a massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051407S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4761167,"authors":[{"name":"Yimo Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yimo Guo","id":"37403661600"},{"name":"Zhengguang Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhengguang Xu","id":"37399426700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761167","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761167","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Image representation","Histograms","Pixel","Image databases","Spatial databases","Feature extraction","Concatenated codes","Pattern matching","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image coding","image representation","sensitivity","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local Gabor phase sensitivity difference pattern","face recognition","image representation","feature encode","discriminative information","Gabor wavelet transform"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761167","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761167.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Gabor phase difference pattern for face recognition","abstract":"A new image representation method is proposed for face recognition in this paper, called local Gabor phase difference pattern (LGPDP).

To detect typical motion patterns in crowded scenarios, we propose a new method which utilizes the instantaneous motions of a video, i.e, the motion flow field, instead of long-term motion tracks. The motion flow field is a union of independent flow vectors computed in different frames. Detecting motion patterns in this flow field can therefore be formulated as a clustering problem of the motion flow fields, where each motion pattern consists of a group of flow vectors participating in the same process or motion. We first construct a directed neighborhood graph to measure the closeness of flow vectors. A hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm is applied to group flow vectors into desired motion patterns.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761183","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761183.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning motion patterns in crowded scenes using motion flow field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Learning motion patterns in crowded scenes using motion flow field","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4761183/","accessionNumber":"10444380","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning motion patterns in crowded scenes using motion flow field","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085412S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4761218,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoko Sudo","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, Yokosuka, Japan"],"lastName":"Kyoko Sudo","id":"37840456600"},{"name":"Tatsuya Osawa","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, Yokosuka, Japan"],"lastName":"Tatsuya Osawa","id":"37561617100"},{"name":"Hidenori Tanaka","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, Yokosuka, Japan"],"lastName":"Hidenori Tanaka","id":"38189862300"},{"name":"Hideki Koike","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, Yokosuka, Japan"],"lastName":"Hideki Koike","id":"37305142800"},{"name":"Kenichi Arakawa","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Communications Laboratory Group, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"lastName":"Kenichi Arakawa","id":"37285637000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761218","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sequences","Principal component analysis","Support vector machines","Layout","Data mining","Laboratories","Costs","Feature extraction","Monitoring","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","principal component analysis","spatiotemporal phenomena","support vector machines","unsupervised learning","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online anomal movement detection","unsupervised incremental learning","spatio-temporal feature extraction","principal component analysis","SVM kernel function","support vector machine","video surveillance system"]}],"abstract":"We propose an online anomal movement detection method using incremental unsupervised learning. As the feature for discrimination, we extract the principal component of the spatio-temporal feature by incremental PCA. We then detect anomal movements by an incremental 1-class SVM. In order to use principal component as the feature for discrimination while supporting incrementation of the subspace, we modify the SVM kernel function to take account of the difference in distance scale between the principal component feature vectors and that of the feature vectors after the subspace is incremented. This allows us to efficiently conduct the relearning process even though the dimension of the original input spatio-temporal feature is high. Experiments show that anomal scenes can be detected without the cost of preparing a lot of labeled data for preliminary learning.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761218","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761218.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online anomal movement detection based on unsupervised incremental learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761218/","displayDocTitle":"Online anomal movement detection based on unsupervised incremental learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444412","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761218/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online anomal movement detection based on unsupervised incremental learning","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04373S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4761282,"authors":[{"name":"Fengqin Yang","affiliation":["College ofComputer Science, Northeast Normal University, Jilin, China","College ofComputer Science & Technology, Jilin University, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Fengqin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37879791100"},{"name":"Changhai Zhang","affiliation":["College ofComputer Science & Technology, Jilin University, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Changhai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37875319300"},{"name":"Tieli Sun","affiliation":["College ofComputer Science, Northeast Normal University, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Tieli","lastName":"Sun","id":"37672488400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761282","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms","Hidden Markov models","Educational institutions","Speech recognition","Sun","Biological cells","Genetic mutations","Statistical analysis","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","genetic algorithms","hidden Markov models","particle swarm optimisation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm","HMM training","hidden Markov model","Baum-Welch algorithm","heuristic optimization technique","continuous speech recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761282","abstract":"Hidden Markov model (HMM) is the dominant technology in speech recognition. The problem of optimizing model parameters is of great interest to the researchers in this area. The Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm is a popular estimation method due to its reliability and efficiency. However, it is easily trapped in local optimum. Recently, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have attracted considerable attention among various modern heuristic optimization techniques. Since the two approaches are supposed to find a solution to a given objective function but employ different strategies and computational effort, it is appropriate to compare their performance. This paper presents the application and performance comparison of PSO and GA for continuous HMM optimization in continuous speech recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that PSO is superior to GA in respect of the recognition performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761282","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761282.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm for HMM training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761282/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm for HMM training","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761282/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10457647","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm for HMM training","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056877S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4761325,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is shown that it clearly outperforms earlier systems on this dataset and further evaluation on two novel web-traffic collections shows the good performance of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761366","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761366.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bag-of-visual-words models for adult image classification and filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761366/","displayDocTitle":"Bag-of-visual-words models for adult image classification and filtering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457712","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761366/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bag-of-visual-words models for adult image classification and filtering","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06272S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4761374,"authors":[{"name":"Shufu Xie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory Research Center, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Digital Media Research Center, Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shufu","lastName":"Xie","id":"38105759200"},{"name":"Shiguang Shan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory Research Center, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Digital Media Research Center, Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiguang","lastName":"Shan","id":"37271963900"},{"name":"Xilin Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory Research Center, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Digital Media Research Center, Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xilin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278215600"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Media, Peking University, Beijing, China","Digital Media Research Center, Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37275735100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761374","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Pattern recognition","Histograms","Gabor filters","Robustness","Concatenated codes","Statistical analysis","Lighting","Computers","Content addressable storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Gabor filters","image coding","image representation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["volume-based local Gabor binary pattern","face representation","face recognition","Gabor feature set","gray image","Gabor filter index","volume encoding","spatial histogram","Gabor transformed image","multiple index map","statistical analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761374","abstract":"In this paper, we propose volume based local Gabor binary patterns (V-LGBP) for face representation and recognition.

Then, the neighborhood order relationship in the ldquovolumerdquo is encoded by local binary patterns (LBP), which converts the Gabor transformed images into multiple index maps. Finally, the spatial histograms of all the V-LGBP index maps are concatenated together to represent the facial appearances. In addition, in order to reflect the uniform appearances of V-LGBP, its uniform patterns are redefined via statistical analysis. Extensive experiments on FERET dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761374","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761374.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"V-LGBP: Volume based local Gabor binary patterns for face representation and recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761374/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"V-LGBP: Volume based local Gabor binary patterns for face representation and recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761374/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10457720","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"V-LGBP: Volume based local Gabor binary patterns for face representation and recognition","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048934S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4761406,"authors":[{"name":"Tie Liu","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, China","Xi'an Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Tie Liu","id":"37087074085"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Nanning Zheng","id":"37087164183"},{"name":"Wei","affiliation":["IBM China Research Lab, China"],"lastName":"Wei Ding","id":"37087311851"},{"name":"Zejian Yuan","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Zejian Yuan","id":"37087212926"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761406","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":615},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Coherence","Energy resolution","Spatial resolution","Switches","Dynamic programming","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","Content based retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video attention","salient object sequence","video segment","energy minimization","conditional random field framework","spatial coherence","temporal coherence","global topic model","dynamic programming algorithm","global optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761406","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761406.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Attention: Learning to Detect a Salient Object Sequence","abstract":"We study video attention by detecting a salient object sequence from video segment.

Our previously developed approach has derived a 234-D feature vector from each test image in HSV color space. The statistical moments of characteristic functions of the image and its wavelet subbands were selected as the distinguishing image features. Since it is possible that only certain image features contain significant information with respect to the classification, the image features with insignificant contributions to classification may be eliminated to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors while maximizing the classification performance. Famous for its efficiency in searching the optimal solution in a very large space, the genetic algorithm is applied to find a reduced feature set which consists of only 100-D features per image in our investigation. The experimental results have demonstrated that the 100-D reduced feature set outperforms the 234-D full feature set.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761552","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761552.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer graphics identification using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761552/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Computer graphics identification using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761552/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10457896","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer graphics identification using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082023S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4761618,"authors":[{"name":"Vorapoj Patanavijit","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Assumption University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Vorapoj","lastName":"Patanavijit","id":"37300535000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761618","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Stochastic processes","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Image resolution","Image reconstruction","Iterative algorithms","Stochastic resonance","Bayesian methods","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","image denoising","image reconstruction","image resolution","iterative methods","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust iterative multiframe SRR","super resolution reconstruction","Hampel stochastic estimation","Hampel-Tikhonov regularization","noisy low resolution image","L2 statistical norm estimation","L1 statistical norm estimation","Bayesian MAP estimation","Salt & Pepper Noise","Speckle noise","Poisson noise"]}],"abstract":"Typically, super resolution reconstruction (SRR) is the process by which additional information is incorporated to enhance a noisy low resolution image hence producing a high resolution image. Although many such SRR algorithms have been proposed, almost SRR estimations are based on L1 or L2 statistical norm estimation hence these SRR algorithms are usually very sensitive to their assumed model of data and noise that limits their utility. This paper proposes a novel SRR algorithm based on the stochastic regularization technique of Bayesian MAP estimation by minimizing a cost function. The Hampel norm is used for measuring the difference between the projected estimate of the high-resolution image and each low resolution image, removing outliers in the data and Tikhonov regularization and Hampel-Tikhonov regularization are used to remove artifacts from the final answer and improve the rate of convergence. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its superiority to other super-resolution algorithms based on L1 and L2 norm for a several noise models such as noiseless, AWGN, Poisson, Salt & Pepper Noise and Speckle Noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761618","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761618.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust iterative multiframe SRR based on Hampel stochastic estimation with Hampel-Tikhonov regularization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A robust iterative multiframe SRR based on Hampel stochastic estimation with Hampel-Tikhonov regularization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4761618/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457962","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761618/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust iterative multiframe SRR based on Hampel stochastic estimation with Hampel-Tikhonov regularization","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058376S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4761638,"authors":[{"name":"Hubert Cecotti","affiliation":["Institute of Automation (IAT), University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hubert","lastName":"Cecotti","id":"37573379000"},{"name":"Axel Graeser","affiliation":["Institute of Automation (IAT), University of Brethemen, Germany"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Graeser","id":"37543261700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761638","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1919},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fourier transforms","Electroencephalography","Convolution","Biological neural networks","Switches","Frequency domain analysis","Computer interfaces","Signal processing","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","Fourier transforms","neural nets","visual evoked potentials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded Fourier transform","EEG classification","brain-computer interface","electroencephalographic steady-state visual evoked potential","convolutional neural vetwork"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761638","abstract":"In BCI (brain - computer interface) systems, brain signals must be processed to identify distinct activities that convey different mental states.

The proposed method is based on a convolutional neural network that includes a Fourier transform between hidden layers in order to switch from the time domain to the frequency domain analysis in the network. The first step allows the creation of different channels. The second step is dedicated to the transformation of the signal in the frequency domain. The last step is the classification. It uses a hybrid rejection strategy that uses a junk class for the mental transition states and thresholds for the confidence values. The presented results with offline processing are obtained with 6 electrodes on 2 subjects with a time segment of 1s.

In addition, a thresholding technique is used to reduce the size of the transition probability matrices, which characterize the Markov random processes.

In the identification scenario, a rank-one accuracy of 99.5% was obtained. To our knowledge, this is the best rank-one score obtained on the FRGC v2 database, as compared to previously published results.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761696","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761696.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D face recognition using the Surface Interpenetration Measure: A comparative evaluation on the FRGC database","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761696/","displayDocTitle":"3D face recognition using the Surface Interpenetration Measure: A comparative evaluation on the FRGC database","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10458040","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761696/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D face recognition using the Surface Interpenetration Measure: A comparative evaluation on the FRGC database","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085005S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4761705,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37404559700"},{"name":"Zhaoxiang Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences"],"firstName":"Zhaoxiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537892500"},{"name":"Kaiqi Huang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences"],"firstName":"Kaiqi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37402212100"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences"],"firstName":"Tieniu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274122900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2175-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"4761705","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":182,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1896},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Head","Image segmentation","Surveillance","Histograms","Feature extraction","Shape","Detection algorithms","Laboratories","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image segmentation","object detection","statistical analysis","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowded scene","MID based foreground segmentation","mosaic image difference","head-shoulder detection","surveillance","histogram oriented gradients method","motion estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel method to address the problem of estimating the number of people in surveillance scenes with people gathering and waiting.

In our framework, the MID-based foreground segmentation module provides active areas for the head-shoulder detection module to detect heads and count the number of people.

This kind of arrhythmia affects mostly elderly people, in particular those who suffer from heart failure (one of the main causes of hospitalization). Thus, detection of AF becomes decisive in the prevention of cardiac threats. In this paper an algorithm for AF detection based on a novel algorithm architecture and feature extraction methods is proposed. The aforementioned architecture is based on the analysis of the three main physiological characteristics of AF: i) P wave absence ii) heart rate irregularity and iii) atrial activity (AA). Discriminative features are extracted using model-based statistic and frequency based approaches. Sensitivity and specificity results (respectively, 93.80% and 96.09% using the MIT-BIH AF database) show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761755","publicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740202/4760915/04761755.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4760915","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Atrial Fibrillation using model-based ECG analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Atrial Fibrillation using model-based ECG analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761755/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10458099","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4761755/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Atrial Fibrillation using model-based ECG analysis","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058491S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740202","isNumber":"4760915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740202","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4760915","articleId":"4761755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4761772,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy C.

We adopt different strategies to compute the corresponding three level qualities: database level quality, class level quality and image level quality.

Thus methods that protect the true iris pattern need to be adopted in practical biometric applications. In particular, it is desirable to have a system that can generate a new unique pattern if the one being used is lost, or generate different unique patterns for different applications to prevent cross-matching. For backwards compatibility, these patterns should look like plausible irises so they can be handled with the same processing tools. However, they should also non-invertibly hide the true biometric so it is never exposed, or even stored.

We derive the ergodic and outage capacity for a cluster head to DGN transmission through a Nakagami-n channel in a wireless sensor network. We also explore the BER analysis for the same channel for an LDPC coded transmission. We compared the ergodic and outage capacity over average SNR for different Nakagami channel parameter. We see that the ergodic as well as outage capacity increases as both SNR and Nakagami-n channel parameters increase. We also compare the outage capacity for different probability of outage. Nakagami-n channel simulations are also compared with AWGN channel simulations. Simulation results show that with the proper choice of LDPC decoding, capacity achieving low power transmission is possible in wireless sensor network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752632/4761935/04761981.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"172","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4761981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4761981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4761935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and BER analysis for Nakagami-n channel in LDPC coded wireless sensor network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Parity check codes","Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency","Performance analysis","Telecommunication network reliability","Capacity planning","AWGN channels","Decoding","Power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","error statistics","Nakagami channels","parity check codes","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER analysis","Nakagami-n channel","LDPC coded wireless sensor network","energy efficient transmission","energy constraint wireless sensor network","communication reliability","ergodic capacity","outage capacity","DGN transmission","AWGN channel simulations","bit error rate","low density parity check codes","data gathering node"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nakagami-n","ergodic capacity","outage capacity","BER","wireless sensor network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4761981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and BER analysis for Nakagami-n channel in LDPC coded wireless sensor network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4761981/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401153","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and BER analysis for Nakagami-n channel in LDPC coded wireless sensor network","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043471S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752632","isNumber":"4761935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752632","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4761935","articleId":"4761981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4762021,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and IT, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37067521100"},{"name":"Pubudu Pathirana","affiliation":["School of Engineering and IT, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Pubudu","lastName":"Pathirana","id":"37266000700"},{"name":"Samitha Ekanayake","affiliation":["School of Engineering and IT, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Samitha","lastName":"Ekanayake","id":"37403040700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2957-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3822-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762021","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Multiaccess communication","Adaptive control","Power system modeling","Base stations","Fading","Programmable control","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","power control","stochastic processes","telecommunication congestion control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power controller design method","CDMA cellular systems design","channel identification","underlying wireless stochastic channel model parameters","time varying network environment","code division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"Power control design is a critical aspect of CDMA cellular systems design.

Traditional sensor nodes must have had a powerful and multi functional Micro-Controller Unit (MCU) to satisfy the requirements for processing any kinds of application. However, most of these systems only use a part of the functions provided by an MCU. In other words, such a unit often consumes a great dead of power for unused circuits. To avoid this situation, we propose the use of a reconfigurable architecture based on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) instead of an MCU because this array dynamically changes the circuit to the optimal one that is just used for the calculation required by an application. Moreover, we implemented a prototype system to do a preliminary evaluation of our proposed mechanism. In this evaluation, we show the performance of our proposed reconfigurable architecture by comparison with traditional architecture that uses processing time and power consumption. The experimental result shows that our proposed mechanism reduces enough power of its sensor nodes to prolong the lifetime of nodes without decreasing the processing time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable hardware architecture for saving power consumption on a sensor node","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4762022","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752632/4761935/04762022.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4762022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4761935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable hardware architecture for saving power consumption on a sensor node","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762022/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401193","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable hardware architecture for saving power consumption on a sensor node","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117338S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752632","isNumber":"4761935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752632","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4761935","articleId":"4762022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4762039,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Rakibul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad Rakibul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37066832300"},{"name":"Jinsang Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Radio Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinsang","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293485100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2957-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3822-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762039","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Energy consumption","Network-on-a-chip","Circuits","Signal processing","Transceivers","Batteries","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient cooperative MIMO technique","wireless sensor network","constellation size","long haul communication","multiple-input multiple-output structure","multiple antennas","data gathering node","energy consumption","SISO structure","correlation coefficient","intersensor distance","single-input single-output structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative technique","energy efficiency","selective approach","MIMO","wireless sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"An energy efficient cooperative MIMO technique is proposed in the wireless sensor networks where fixed constellation size is considered in transmitting both the local and long haul communication.

In conventional estimation algorithms, channel parameters are usually estimated using a channel length that is related to the maximum delay spread of the channel. However, this can result in estimating too many parameters where many of them are either zero or insignificant. In this work we propose algorithms that estimate then identify only significant channel parameters, leading to parsimonious receivers. First, we use userspsila spreading codes and the received signal to form a data model for the system. Then, a blind adaptive channel estimation algorithm is derived to estimate the channel response. This is followed by a model selection algorithm to identify significant channel parameters among the estimated ones. Compared with conventional algorithms, our algorithm: (i) estimates the channel response with a faster convergence rate (ii) has lower estimation errors (iii) identifies significant parameters with high probabilities and at low SNRs (iv) has a lower BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4762041","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752632/4761935/04762041.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4762041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4761935","startPage":"517","endPage":"522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model selection-based blind adaptive channel estimation algorithms for parsimonious receivers in CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model selection-based blind adaptive channel estimation algorithms for parsimonious receivers in CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762041/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401211","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4762041/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model selection-based blind adaptive channel estimation algorithms for parsimonious receivers in CDMA systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045285S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752632","isNumber":"4761935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752632","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4761935","articleId":"4762041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4762043,"authors":[{"name":"Enqing Chen","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Enqing Chen","id":"37290876200"},{"name":"Jiankang Zhang","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jiankang Zhang","id":"37579430500"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xiaomin Mu","id":"37287621700"},{"name":"Shouyi Yang","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Shouyi Yang","id":"37292116100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2957-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3822-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762043","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"abstract":"Existing maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems requires knowledge of the effective length of the channel impulse response (CIR) to achieve the optimum performance. But it is very difficult to track effective length of the CIR in a practical system. By analyzing the relation between the performance of the ML estimation and the exactness of the CIR effective length estimation, we propose a novel ML channel estimator which combine the ML estimation with the successive approximation based on Lagrange interpolation polynomial and can track the variation of the effective length of CIR more easily. Simulation results show that the proposed ML channel estimation algorithm can provide nearly the same performance as the conventional ML channel estimation with the actual length of CIR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752632/4761935/04762043.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing","doi":"10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4762043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSNIP.2008.4762043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4761935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An novel ML estimator based on the Lagrange interpolation for the OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Lagrangian functions","Interpolation","Channel estimation","Frequency estimation","Smoothing methods","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Intersymbol interference","DSL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interpolation","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ML estimator","Lagrange interpolation polynomial","OFDM systems","maximum likelihood channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","channel impulse response","effective length estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","channel estimation","effective length of channel impulse response","maximum likelihood"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An novel ML estimator based on the Lagrange interpolation for the OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762043/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10401213","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An novel ML estimator based on the Lagrange interpolation for the OFDM systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01172009-00108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087882S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752632","isNumber":"4761935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752632","xplore-issue":"4761935","articleId":"4762043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4762075,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.A.

Traditionally designed artificial systems struggle to solve this task in real time, despite utilising high-resolution cameras, sophisticated software and computers with hundreds of millions of transistors. However insects, with low-resolution eyes and small brains (less than a million neurons), are able to avoid obstacles and successfully navigate through complex surrounds during high-speed flight. By studying the underlying neuronal processes governing this remarkable ability it has been possible to reverse engineer models for biological visual processing which rival insects in image normalisation (ability to detect objects independent of environmental conditions) and fast, reliable motion detection across different scenes. These models have been implemented in both software simulations and real-world hardware.","doi":"10.1109/IVCNZ.2008.4762075","publicationTitle":"2008 23rd International Conference Image and Vision Computing New Zealand","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 23rd International Conference Image and Vision Computing New Zealand","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740206/4762060/04762075.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ.2008.4762075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications for bio-inspired visual processing algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762075/","displayDocTitle":"Applications for bio-inspired visual processing algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10400906","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762075/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications for bio-inspired visual processing algorithms","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-01192009-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0804S","chronDate":"26-28 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740206","isNumber":"4762060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740206","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4762060","articleId":"4762075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4762094,"authors":[{"name":"Tam Phuong Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Tam Phuong Cao","id":"37941471600"},{"name":"Guang Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Guang Deng","id":"37270894000"},{"name":"David Mulligan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Mulligan","id":"38191263500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2582-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2583-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3780-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-2191"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4762094","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Face detection","Detection algorithms","Humans","Leg","Vehicles","Video surveillance","Sensor systems","Cameras","Head"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alarm systems","field programmable gate arrays","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time pedestrian detection","FPGA","car accidents","pedestrian recognition","pedestrian warning system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pedestrian detection","vision-based safety","image processing","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Every year, many pedestrians are killed or seriously injured due to car accidents.

The second deals with disco's activities in real-time and is termed real-time operations model (RTOM). The DAOM determines the disco's operational decisions on grid purchase, scheduling of distributed generation (DG) units owned by it, and contracting for interruptible load. These decisions are imposed as boundary constraints in the RTOM and the disco seeks to minimize its short-term costs keeping in mind its day-ahead decisions. A case-study is presented considering the well-known 33-bus distribution system and three different scenarios are constructed to analyze the disco's actions and decision-making in this context.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10428892","htmlLink":"/document/4762171/","displayDocTitle":"A Generic Operations Framework for Discos in Retail Electricity Markets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic Operations Framework for Discos in Retail Electricity Markets","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-kbhattacharya-2007001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059985S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4762160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"4762160","articleId":"4762171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4762173,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo M.

It may, therefore, seem that a good approach to reduce losses would be the solving of a network reconfiguration problem to suit each of the significant load variations. However, frequent changes in configuration can trigger outages or cause transient problems; they are best avoided. A recent formulation of this problem explicitly considers load variations and proposes to restrain frequent reconfigurations by assuming that network topologies will remain unchanged for a given planning period. This formulation leads to a much larger optimization problem than that traditionally used for network reconfiguration; moreover, it requires a new approach to optimization which is capable of dealing with energy flows instead of only instantaneous power flows. Such an approach is proposed in this paper, which discusses the design of an adaptive hybrid genetic algorithm that fulfills these new requirements. Key concepts in evolutionary computation and analysis of distribution systems are explored to develop this new algorithm. Application to real case studies certifies its benefits.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2009488","startPage":"445","endPage":"453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4762160/04762173.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2009488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Technical Loss Reduction in Distribution Networks Under Variable Demands","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Switches","Algorithm design and analysis","Load management","Network topology","Power engineering and energy","Brazil Council","Power systems","Load flow","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive hybrid genetic algorithm","technical loss reduction","power distribution networks","evolutionary computation","network reconfiguration","variable demands"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distribution of electric power","genetic algorithms","hybrid genetic algorithms","loss reduction","network reconfiguration","technical losses","variable demands"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Technical Loss Reduction in Distribution Networks Under Variable Demands","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4762173/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10458286","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Technical Loss Reduction in Distribution Networks Under Variable Demands","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs01-lqueiroz-2009488.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070826S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4762160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4762160","articleId":"4762173","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4762174,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa El Mokadem","affiliation":["Ecole des Hautes Etudes d''Ing\u00e9nieurs, Lille, France"],"bio":{"p":["Mostafa El Mokadem received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Le Havre, Le Havre, France, in September 2006.","Since October 2006, he has been a Post-Doc with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole des Hautes Etudes d'Ingenieur, Lille, France.

The fuzzy logic supervisor ensures a regular primary reserve for a large range of wind speeds without any wind speed measurement. This supervisor controls simultaneously the generator torque and the pitch angle to keep the primary reserve; it determines in real time the generator power reference value. The fuzzy logic supervisor is compared to a simpler strategy, based only on the control of the generator torque. This classical strategy ensures a regular power reserve only when the wind generator operates at full load, and the generator power reference needs to be determined previously or by the network manager. A procedure for implementing a fuzzy logic supervisor in real time is proposed. The experiments indicate the regularity of the power reserve and the ability to contribute to frequency control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4762174/","accessionNumber":"10428893","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Logic Supervisor-Based Primary Frequency Control Experiments of a Variable-Speed Wind Generator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Logic Supervisor-Based Primary Frequency Control Experiments of a Variable-Speed Wind Generator","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-melmokadem-2007005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073608S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4762160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4762160","articleId":"4762174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4762177,"authors":[{"name":"Thi Thu Ha Pham","affiliation":["National Superior Electrical Engineering School of Grenoble (ENSIEG), Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4762160/4762177/4762177-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thi Thu Ha Pham received the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from INP Grenoble, Grenoble, France, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","She works in collaboration with GIE-IDEA, the Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory (G2ELAB) in France and Hanoi University of Technologies in Vietnam.

This course is unique in the sense that it covers five main paradigms of CI and their integration to develop hybrid intelligent systems. The paradigms covered are artificial immune systems (AISs), evolutionary computing (EC), fuzzy systems (FSs), neural networks (NNs) and swarm intelligence (SI). While individual CI paradigms have been applied successfully to solve real-world problems, the current trend is to develop hybrids of these paradigms since no one paradigm is superior to any other for solving all types of problems. In doing so, respective strengths of individual components in a hybrid CI system are capitalized while their weaknesses are eliminated. This CI course is at the introductory level and the objective is to lead students to in-depth courses and specialization in a particular paradigm (AISs, EC, FSs, NNs, SI). The idea of an integrated and interdisciplinary course like this, especially at the undergraduate level, is to expose students to different CI paradigms at an early stage in their degree program and career. The curriculum, assessment, implementation, and impacts of an interdisciplinary CI course are described.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2008.930983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2008.930983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/4762294/04762306.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A successful interdisciplinary course on coputational intelligence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"A successful interdisciplinary course on coputational intelligence","volume":"4","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762306/","publicationDate":"February 2009","accessionNumber":"10467309","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762306/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A successful interdisciplinary course on coputational intelligence","sourcePdf":"04mci01-venayagamoor.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138686S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"4762294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4762294","articleId":"4762306","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4762308,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068756700"},{"name":"Ye-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ye-Hoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406993600"},{"name":"Seung-Hwan Choi","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Hwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292418600"},{"name":"In-Won Park","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Won","lastName":"Park","id":"37287263800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"4762308","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":931},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Educational robots","Navigation","Fuzzy systems","Robot vision systems","Computer science education","Educational programs","Control systems","Evolutionary computation","Sorting","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering education","evolutionary computation","fuzzy reasoning","fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","Pareto optimisation","path planning","probability","sport"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary multiobjective optimization","robot soccer system","education","mobile robotics","computational intelligence-based navigation","multiobjective population","incremental learning","fuzzy path planner","probability vector","Pareto-optimal solution set"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCI.2008.930985","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/4762294/04762308.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2008.930985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization in robot soccer system for education","abstract":"As the robot soccer system becomes stabilized, it has been used as an educational platform with which various topics on mobile robotics can be taught. As one of key topics in the education of mobile robotics is computational intelligence-based navigation, this paper proposes a multiobjective population-based incremental learning (MOPBIL) algorithm to obtain the fuzzy path planner for optimal path to the ball, minimizing three objectives such as elapsed time, heading direction and posture angle errors in a robot soccer system. MOPBIL employs the probabilistic mechanism, which generates new population using probability vectors. As the probability vectors are updated by referring to nondominated solutions, population converges to Pareto-optimal solution set. Simulation and experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed MOPBIL from the viewpoint of the proximity to the Pareto-optimal set, size of the dominated space, coverage of two sets and diversity metric. By implementing each of the solutions into the educational platform, it can be educated how multi-objective optimization is realized in the real-world problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"February 2009","accessionNumber":"10467311","htmlLink":"/document/4762308/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization in robot soccer system for education","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization in robot soccer system for education","sourcePdf":"04mci01-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.260386S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"4762294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4762294","articleId":"4762308","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4762360,"authors":[{"name":"Terrence Mak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineeing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Terrence","lastName":"Mak","id":"37281072900"},{"name":"Pete Sedcole","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineeing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Pete","lastName":"Sedcole","id":"37265573900"},{"name":"Peter Y.K.

Two circuit designs are proposed to realize wave-pipelined link using FPGA fabrics. The proposed approaches are also compared with conventional synchronous and asynchronous pipelining techniques. It is shown that, the wave-pipelined approach can achieve up to 5.66 times improvement in throughput versus the synchronous link and 13% improvement in power consumption and 35% improvement in delay versus the synchronous register-pipelining. Also, trade-offs between power, speed and area between the proposed and conventional designs are studied.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762360","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762360.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wave-pipelined signaling for on-FPGA communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Wave-pipelined signaling for on-FPGA communication","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762360/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459573","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave-pipelined signaling for on-FPGA communication","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068679S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4762362,"authors":[{"name":"Cindy Mark","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Cindy","lastName":"Mark","id":"37839539600"},{"name":"Ava Shui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ava","lastName":"Shui","id":"38191337000"},{"name":"Steve Wilton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Wilton","id":"37265862300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2796-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3783-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762362","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Tuned circuits","System-on-a-chip","Character generation","Power system modeling","Logic circuits","Network-on-a-chip","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network synthesis","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA architecture evaluation","system-level stochastic circuit generator","system-on-chip design flow","SoC circuits"]}],"abstract":"We describe a stochastic circuit generator that can be used to automatically create benchmark circuits for use in FPGA architecture studies.

We compare our circuits to those generated by previous circuit generators, and characterize our circuits with respect to the type of network used to connect modules.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762362","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762362.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A system-level stochastic circuit generator for FPGA architecture evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A system-level stochastic circuit generator for FPGA architecture evaluation","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762362/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459575","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4762362/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A system-level stochastic circuit generator for FPGA architecture evaluation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089874S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4762363,"authors":[{"name":"Florent de Dinechin","affiliation":["LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL), \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"de Dinechin","id":"37347508700"},{"name":"Bogdan Pasca","affiliation":["LIP (CNRS/INRIA/ENS-Lyon/UCBL), \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Pasca","id":"37545456300"},{"name":"Octavian Cret","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca"],"firstName":"Octavian","lastName":"Cret","id":"37572613300"},{"name":"Radu Tudoran","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Tudoran","id":"38190351400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2796-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3783-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762363","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":529},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-specific approach to floating-point accumulation and sum-of-products","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762363.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Application software","Frequency","Costs","Acceleration","Delay","Computer science","Feeds","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-specific approach","floating-point accumulation","sum-of-product","design application-specific floating-point operator","ad-hoc accumulator","floating-point multiplier","FloPoCo generator","processor floating point unit","graphic processing unit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762363","abstract":"This article studies two common situations where the flexibility of FPGAs allows one to design application-specific floating-point operators which are more efficient and more accurate than those offered by processors and GPUs.

By tailoring its parameters to the numerical requirements of the application, it can be made arbitrarily accurate, at an area cost comparable to that of a standard floating-point adder, and at a higher frequency. The second example is the sum-of-product operation, which is the building block of matrix computations. A novel architecture is proposed that feeds the previous accumulator out of a floating-point multiplier whose rounding logic has been removed, again improving the area/accuracy tradeoff.

This paper describes our work on optimizing residue arithmetic units on the platform of reconfigurable devices, such as FPGAs. First, we provide improved designs for residue arithmetic units. For reverse converters from RNS to binary numbers, we propose a novel design that uses only n-bit additions. Compared to previous work, the design consumes up to 14.3% less area and provides lower latency. Second, we develop a reconfigurable RNS arithmetic library generator for the moduli set {2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n-1, 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n, 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n+1}.

Typically, reconfigurable arrays do not provide architectural support for shift operations. Instead, shift operations are emulated by either multiplexing logic or multiplication by a power of 2. In this paper we describe the architecture of a reconfigurable array that can natively support shift operations. Rather than augmenting the reconfigurable fabric with dedicated shift units, the interconnection network is extended with shift capabilities. This is conceptually possible since a shift operation is a rearrangement and not a combination of the signals. Layers of computing tiles supporting Shift-and-Add/Subtract and Add-and-Select operations are interleaved with interconnect layers. On such a reconfigurable array, a variety of transcendental functions can be efficiently implemented.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762365","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762365.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable array for transcendental functions calculation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762365/","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable array for transcendental functions calculation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459578","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762365/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable array for transcendental functions calculation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080303S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4762366,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Wai Yu","affiliation":["Dept of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Chi Wai","lastName":"Yu","id":"37675194400"},{"name":"Alastair M.

The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n the characters.

This paper illustrates the benefits of such implementation in the context of financial computing as it implements a financial Monte-Carlo simulation engine on an FPGA-based supercomputer, called Maxwell, developed at the University of Edinburgh. The latter consists of a 32 CPU cluster augmented with 64 Virtex-4 Xilinx FPGAs connected in a 2D torus. Our engine can implement various Monte-Carlo simulations on the Maxwell machine with speed-ups in the 3-order magnitude compared to equivalent software implementations. This is illustrated in this paper in the context of an implementation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Real hardware implementation shows that our FPGA-based implementation of the Black-Scholes model outperforms an equivalent software implementation running on a workstation cluster with the same number of computing nodes (CPU/FPGA) by a factor of 750, which is the fastest ever reported FPGA implementation of this model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a High Performance Financial Monte-Carlo Simulation Engine on an FPGA Supercomputer","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762369","startPage":"81","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762369.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a High Performance Financial Monte-Carlo Simulation Engine on an FPGA Supercomputer","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762369/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459581","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a High Performance Financial Monte-Carlo Simulation Engine on an FPGA Supercomputer","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062997S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4762370,"authors":[{"name":"David B.

Because these simulations are independent and embarrassingly parallel, FPGAs are increasingly being used to implement Monte-Carlo applications. However, as the number of simulation runs increases, the problem of accurately accumulating the aggregate statistics, such as the mean and variance, becomes very difficult. This paper examines three accumulation methods, adapting them for use in FPGA applications. In particular, we develop a mean and variance calculator based on cascading accumulators, which is able to process streams of floating-point data in one pass, while operating in fixed-point internally. This method has the advantage that it calculates the exact sample mean and an accurate numerically stable sample variance, while using few logic resources and providing performance to match commercial floating-point operators: clock rates of 434 MHz are achieved in Virtex-5, 1.46 times faster than a double-precision accumulator, while using one eighth of the resources.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762370","startPage":"89","endPage":"96","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762370.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of sample mean and variance for Monte-Carlo simulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of sample mean and variance for Monte-Carlo simulations","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762370/","accessionNumber":"10459582","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762370/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of sample mean and variance for Monte-Carlo simulations","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054248S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4762372,"authors":[{"name":"Justin S.

The task becomes even more troublesome, if the application is being run in a parallel environment where relationships between each application execution are needed to grasp the necessary understanding of the application behavior. FPGA flexibility increases the complexity of such tasks by allowing not only changes to the application, to adapt to the hardware, but also to tailor the hardware for a specific application. To take full advantage of these systems, a tool that will help the user to understand an application is paramount. In this paper, we present a profiler for the TMD, a heterogeneous multicore multiFPGA system designed at the University of Toronto. The profiler can be configured for a specific application running on a specific hardware configuration. It allows retrieval of all communication calls and any user state defined by instrumentation of the source code. We test the profiler with two simple case studies: MPI Barrier, where we compare a sequential with a binary tree algorithm, and a heat equation solver that uses the Jacobi iterations method, where we compare blocking with non-blocking MPI calls.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762373","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762373.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A profiler for a heterogeneous multi-core multi-FPGA system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762373/","displayDocTitle":"A profiler for a heterogeneous multi-core multi-FPGA system","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762373/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459585","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A profiler for a heterogeneous multi-core multi-FPGA system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058906S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4762381,"authors":[{"name":"Kofi Appiah","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Informatics, Faculty of Media, Humanities and Technology, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK"],"firstName":"Kofi","lastName":"Appiah","id":"37541601200"},{"name":"Andrew Hunter","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Informatics, Faculty of Media, Humanities and Technology, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Hunter","id":"37277312100"},{"name":"Patrick Dickinson","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Informatics, Faculty of Media, Humanities and Technology, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Dickinson","id":"37529464300"},{"name":"Jonathan Owens","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Informatics, Faculty of Media, Humanities and Technology, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Owens","id":"37277323300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2796-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3783-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762381","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":628},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Software algorithms","Labeling","Image analysis","Performance analysis","Encoding","Computer architecture","Hardware","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image coding","image representation","parallel algorithms","random-access storage","runlength codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-length image encoding","real-time connected component algorithm","FPGA implementation","field programmable gate array","image representation","parallel sequential operation","block internal RAM"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a real-time connected component labelling algorithm designed for field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation.

The optimised single-pass algorithm reduces the worst case memory requirement by over 100 times that of the original algorithm (for measuring region area), and reduces the latency to only 1 row.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762382","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","startPage":"185","endPage":"192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimised single pass connected components analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimised single pass connected components analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762382/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459594","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4762382/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimised single pass connected components analysis","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052007S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4762383,"authors":[{"name":"Hirokazu Morishita","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Hirokazu Morishita","id":"38101893800"},{"name":"Yasunori Osana","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Seikei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yasunori Osana","id":"38492998000"},{"name":"Naoyuki Fujita","affiliation":["Aerospace Research and Development Directorate, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoyuki Fujita","id":"38099413900"},{"name":"Hideharu Amano","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"lastName":"Hideharu Amano","id":"37280731600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2796-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3783-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762383","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762383","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational fluid dynamics","Field programmable gate arrays","Aerospace engineering","Pipelines","Acceleration","Supercomputers","Algorithms","Large-scale systems","Arithmetic","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace simulation","computational fluid dynamics","field programmable gate arrays","pipeline arithmetic","random-access storage","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory hierarchy","computational fluid dynamics accelerator","FPGA","custom pipeline","memory access method","block-RAM","UPACS","CFD software package"]}],"abstract":"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an important tool for aeronautical engineers. Instead of expensive super-computers or clusters, using custom pipelines built on FPGAs is expected to be a cost effective solution to accelerate CFD. The problem is that to keep the pipeline busy is difficult because of the memory bandwidth. To deal with this problem, an effective memory access method using block-RAMs is implemented based on a careful survey about memory access pattern. This work is targetting on two major subroutines in UPACS, a CFD software package. As a result, the amount of data transfer is reduced about 40%.

Differential power analysis (DPA) is one of the most effective power analysis techniques. In recent years numerous countermeasures against the DPA attack of hardware implementations of security algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the random delay insertion (RDI) countermeasure. Previous research has evaluated RDI for microprocessor implementations; however, its security properties in relation to hardware implementations have not been investigated in detail. We prove both theoretically and practically that it is an effective technique on FPGA devices and we propose a set of critical parameters that can be utilized to optimize a security algorithm design with RDI in terms of area, speed and power. In this work, we implement the first hardware security architecture with RDI on an FPGA device, and attack it using DPA. It is shown that RDI is an efficient countermeasure technique on FPGA in comparison to other countermeasures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Hardware","Information security","Cryptography","Energy consumption","Circuit analysis","Microprocessors","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential analysers","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","random delay insertion countermeasure","DPA","differential power analysis","circuits power consumption","power analysis techniques","microprocessor implementations","RDI","security algorithm design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762384","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762384","startPage":"201","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762384.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762384/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation and Analysis of Random Delay Insertion Countermeasure against DPA","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10459596","htmlLink":"/document/4762384/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation and Analysis of Random Delay Insertion Countermeasure against DPA","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084687S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4762385,"authors":[{"name":"Moritz Schmid","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Moritz","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37532674700"},{"name":"Daniel Ziener","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Ziener","id":"37300389000"},{"name":"Jurgen Teich","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2796-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3783-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762385","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Watermarking","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Hardware","Intellectual property","Security","Computer science","Logic","Shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signatures","field programmable gate arrays","industrial property","logic design","optimisation","table lookup","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LUT-based FPGA","IP protection","watermark FPGA design","netlist level","lookup table","shift register","optimization algorithm","intellectual property","field programmable gate arrays","signature bit"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach to watermark FPGA designs on the netlist level. We restrict the dynamically addressable part of the logic table, thus freeing space for insertion of signature bits into lookup tables (LUTs).

Converting functional LUTs to LUT-based RAMs or shift registers prevents deletion due to optimization. With this technique, we take watermark carrying components out of the scope of optimization algorithms to achieve complete transparency towards development environments.

To avoid significant performance loss through pessimistic over-design new design strategies are required that are cognisant of within-die performance variability. This paper examines the effect of process variability on the clock resources in FPGA devices. A model of variation in clock skew in FPGA clock networks is presented. Techniques for reducing the impact of variations on the performance of implemented designs are proposed and analysed, demonstrating that skew variation can be reduced by 70% or more through a combination of phase adjustment and clock rerouting.

An architecture description file defines various architectural parameters including the definition of new coarse grained blocks, the positioning of blocks in the architecture and the selection of routing network. Once the initial architecture is defined, a software flow places and routes a target netlist on the generated architecture. The placement cost of a netlist is optimized either by changing the position of netlist instances on its respective blocks or by changing the position of blocks on the architecture. A single FPGA architecture can also be obtained for mapping a set of netlists at mutually exclusive times. It has been found that the sum of the placement costs of all the netlists is found to be minimum if all the netlists are used to get a single architecture. A set of DSP test-benches is used to show the effectiveness of the various techniques used in this work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459608","htmlLink":"/document/4762399/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new coarse-grained FPGA architecture exploration environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new coarse-grained FPGA architecture exploration environment","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039279S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4762402,"authors":[{"name":"Yosuke Kawanaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yosuke","lastName":"Kawanaka","id":"38190218600"},{"name":"Shin'ichi Wakabayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin'ichi","lastName":"Wakabayashi","id":"37373522600"},{"name":"Shinobu Nagayama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Nagayama","id":"37267058500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2796-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3783-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762402","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern matching","Engines","Intrusion detection","Circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Application software","Telecommunication traffic","Hardware design languages","Computer architecture","Computer applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","security of data","string matching","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern matching engine","network intrusion detection","string matching circuit","systolic architecture","FPGA implementation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a high-speed string matching circuit for searching a pattern in a given text.

Quipu is a part of the Delft Workbench project, a semi-automatic tool platform supporting integrated hardware-software co-design for heterogeneous computing systems. Because of the highly iterative nature of design in such tool platforms, fast and early estimates of hardware properties are required. One aspect of particular importance is the utilization of interconnect resources, which has increased with designs becoming larger, even to the point where some designs are no longer routable.

A number of techniques have been proposed to tackle routability, timing or power objectives independently during clustering stage. However, there is minimal work that targets multiple optimization goals. In this paper, we evaluate a clustering technique that targets routability and timing goals simultaneously. We combine the timing-driven T-VPack algorithm with a routability-driven non-uniform depopulation scheme (T-RDPack). Our technique keeps clusters on the critical path fully populated, while depopulating other clusters in the design. This approach has been implemented into the versatile place and route (VPR) toolset. We show that, compared to T-VPack, channel width reductions of 11.5%, 19.1%, 24.7% are achieved while incurring an area overhead of 0.6%, 3.1%, 9.1% respectively with negligible increase in critical path delay, exceeding the performance of T-RPack.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762409.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762409","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent timing based and routability driven depopulation technique for FPGA packing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent timing based and routability driven depopulation technique for FPGA packing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762409/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4762409/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459616","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent timing based and routability driven depopulation technique for FPGA packing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071793S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4762411,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Implementation results present a speed-up factor up to three orders of magnitude of the most computational expensive part of the algorithm compared to the algorithmpsilas software implementation.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762412","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762412.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable FPGA architecture for non-linear SVM training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762412/","displayDocTitle":"A scalable FPGA architecture for non-linear SVM training","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762412/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459619","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable FPGA architecture for non-linear SVM training","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044341S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4762413,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Miura","affiliation":["Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazuo Miura","id":"38186911700"},{"name":"Hiroki Noguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"lastName":"Hiroki Noguchi","id":"37532700600"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"lastName":"Hiroshi Kawaguchi","id":"37270375100"},{"name":"Masahiko Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"lastName":"Masahiko Yoshimoto","id":"37269600500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2796-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3783-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762413","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Real time systems","Speech recognition","Field programmable gate arrays","Hidden Markov models","Frequency","Vocabulary","Hardware","Very large scale integration","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","field programmable gate arrays","Gaussian processes","parallel memories","speech recognition","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vocabulary real-time continuous speech recognition","low memory bandwidth","Gaussian mixture model processor","FPGA system","parallelization","vector look-ahead scheme"]}],"abstract":"We propose a GMM processor for large vocabulary real-time continuous speech recognition.

Now that FPGAs are large enough to implement SoCs, the reprogrammable fabric allows a different approach to the design process where on-chip computer aided design (CAD) tools can leverage reconfigurability to reduce design time. Statistics on commercial SoC designs suggest that 50% or more of design time may be spent on testing and verification due to design complexity. In previous work, we have proposed the systems integrating modules with predefined physical links (SIMPPL) SoC architectural framework to improve the design process. The defined communication links and protocols have been used to reduce integration time by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we propose an on-chip testbed that leverages both SIMPPL and an FPGApsilas reconfigurability to enable onchip testing and verification in real time using run time traffic patterns to reduce design time. The proposed testbed requires 331 LUTs and 224 flipflops for the Transmitter and 31 LUTs and 30 flipflops for the receiver. This testbed is able to generate a variety of possible run time traffic patterns that may be used to verify the operation of the CE.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-chip testbed that emulates runtime traffic and reduces design verification time for FPGA designs","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762418","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740372/4762340/04762418.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2008.4762418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An on-chip testbed that emulates runtime traffic and reduces design verification time for FPGA designs","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762418/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459625","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-chip testbed that emulates runtime traffic and reduces design verification time for FPGA designs","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01212009-00078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042253S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740372","isNumber":"4762340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740372","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4762340","articleId":"4762418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4762419,"authors":[{"name":"Naoto Miyamoto","affiliation":["New Industry Creation Hatchery Center, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Naoto Miyamoto","id":"37274290200"},{"name":"Tadahiro Ohmi","affiliation":["New Industry Creation Hatchery Center, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"lastName":"Tadahiro Ohmi","id":"37267281400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2795-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2796-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3783-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762419","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","Large-scale systems","Emulation","Context","Sequential circuits","Circuit simulation","Wire","Hardware","Combinational circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","microprocessor chips","sequential circuits","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay evaluation","CMOS multicontext FPGA design","shift register-type temporal communication module","large-scale circuit emulation","D-flip flop","sequential circuit","flexible processor","size 90 nm"]}],"abstract":"For large-scale circuit emulation with using a multi-context FPGA (MC-FPGA), a circuit is divided into multiple sub-circuits, each sub-circuit is assigned to a context., and the MC-FPGA sequentially executes all the contexts one by one. So, the total execution delay is the sum of the delays of the contexts. It is, therefore, said that the total execution delay of the MC-FPGA increases proportional to the number of contexts used. However, in this paper, we show that the total execution delay remains constant if a shift-register-type temporal communication module (SRTCM) is used instead of D-flipflop (D-FF) to implement sequential circuits. The SR-TCM is used not only for signal communication of sequential circuit like D-FF, but also for signal communication from preceding context to succeeding contexts. In order to quantify the delay, a MC-FPGA named flexible processor (FP), which contains the SR-TCM, have been designed and fabricated in 90 nm CMOS process technology. From the measurement results, the total execution delay of the FP was kept constant regardless of the number of contexts used.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2008.4762419","publicationTitle":"2008 International

This research is directed towards the study of contamination of insulator under marine pollution. The leakage currents of porcelain insulators were monitored together with environmental data at a coastal test site in south of Iran. In this paper it is shown how, using artificial neural network (ANN) as a function estimator; the daily variation of leakage current can be predicted accurately from temperature, humidity, wind velocity and ultraviolet radiance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762434/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10469251","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762434/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network for insulator leakage currents prediction from environmental data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network for insulator leakage currents prediction from environmental data","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053031S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752630","isNumber":"4762428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752630","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4762428","articleId":"4762434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4762438,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Traditionally, power system stabilizers (PSS) are being used to damp these oscillations. Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is a well-known FACTS device that can control power flow in transmission lines. It can also replace PSS to damp low frequency oscillations effectively through direct control of voltage and power. In this paper a linearized Heffron-Philips model of a (Single Machine-Infinite Bus) power system with a unified power flow controller is developed. The designed fuzzy-based UPFC controller adjusts four UPFC inputs by appropriately processing of the input error signal, and provides an efficient damping. The results of the simulation show that the UPFC with fuzzy-based controllers is more effective in damping LFO compared to UPFC with PID controllers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECON.2008.4762450","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752630/4762428/04762450.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","doi":"10.1109/PECON.2008.4762450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic based UPFC controller for damping low frequency oscillations of power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic based UPFC controller for damping low frequency oscillations of power systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4762450/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469267","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762450/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic based UPFC controller for damping low frequency oscillations of power systems","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044663S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752630","isNumber":"4762428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752630","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4762428","articleId":"4762450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4762475,"authors":[{"name":"Ashkan M.Z.

The suitable control scheme for this type of converter necessitates equal voltage sharing for series connected modules and equal current sharing for the parallel connected modules for all operating conditions even with existence of dissimilarity in devices and components used in each module. Such a control scheme can be designed by means of linear controllers. But in the case of large variations in the parameters or considerable difference between modules of converter, linear scheme cannot accomplish equal sharing correctly. In this paper a MIMO controller scheme based on artificial neural network (ANN) will be developed to solve this problem in an input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) DC-DC converter. The proposed MIMO controller is trained using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Using PSO to train the ANN based controller, eliminates the need for a prior knowledge of the system dynamics. The latter merit shows its significant usefulness when the under study system is a large multi-module system and consequently the derivation if its dynamic equations is a tedious and time consuming work. To implement the proposed controller for the ISOP converter MATLAB software will be used in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a MIMO controller for a multimodul Dc-Dc converter based on Particle Swarm Optimized neural network","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","doi":"10.1109/PECON.2008.4762475","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752630/4762428/04762475.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECON.2008.4762475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of a MIMO controller for a multimodul Dc-Dc converter based on Particle Swarm Optimized neural network","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762475/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469286","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a MIMO controller for a multimodul Dc-Dc converter based on Particle Swarm Optimized neural network","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041927S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752630","isNumber":"4762428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752630","xplore-issue":"4762428","articleId":"4762475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4762480,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The large power system is divided into five smaller areas depending on the coherency of the areas when subjected to disturbances. This is to reduce the number of data sets collected for the respective areas. Transient stability of the power system is first determined based on the generator relative rotor angles obtained from time domain simulation outputs. Simulations were carried out on the test system considering three phase faults at different loading conditions. The data collected from the time domain simulations are then used as inputs to the PNN and LS-SVM. Both networks are used as classifiers to determine whether the power system is stable or unstable. Classification results show that the PNN gives faster and more accurate transient stability assessment compared to the LS-SVM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762523/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10469327","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762523/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparing least squares support vector machine and probabilistic neural network in transient stability assessment of a large-scale power system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing least squares support vector machine and probabilistic neural network in transient stability assessment of a large-scale power system","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053185S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752630","isNumber":"4762428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752630","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4762428","articleId":"4762523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4762540,"authors":[{"name":"Reza.Mohammadi.

The controller consists of two fuzzy logic blocks, main and gain tuning, respectively. The main fuzzy block acts as a speed controller, while the gain tuning block scales the output of main fuzzy. The output gain tuning has the same inputs as main fuzzy (i.e. speed error and change of error). By introducing output gain tuning, overshoot and settling time can be restrained.

Unlike trivial PSO, this algorithm runs the refinement process of the solutions within multiple populations. Some genetic algorithm operators such as crossover, elitism, mutation are applied within the higher potential solutions to generate new solutions for next population. The PSO includes a new variable for updating velocity in accordance with population best with particle best and global best.

The proposed method is able to identify all ten shunt faults in transmission lines with high level of robustness against variable conditions such as measured amplitudes and fault resistance. In this approach, a two-end unsynchronized measurement of the signals is used. For real-time estimation of unknown synchronization angle and three phase phasors a two-layer adaptive linear neural (ADALINE) network is used. The estimated parameters are fed to a fuzzy logic system to classify fault types. This method is feasible to be used in digital distance relays which are able to be programmed, to share and discourse data with all protective and monitoring devices. The proposed method is evaluated by a number of simulations conducted in PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB software.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762602/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10469393","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762602/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive hybrid neural network and fuzzy logic based fault classification approach for transmission lines protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive hybrid neural network and fuzzy logic based fault classification approach for transmission lines protection","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062607S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752630","isNumber":"4762428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752630","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4762428","articleId":"4762602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4762603,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In addition, the device may also be used to compensate current harmonics of nonlinear loads. Since the maximum amplitude variations in the supply currents become minimized, the compensator provides a possibility for power rating reduction of the transmission system. The compensator consists of a shunt active filter and a supercapacitor (SC) bank energy storage coupled to the system DC link via a bidirectional 3-phase DC-DC converter. The purpose of the equipment is to draw steady average power from the mains and to compensate the power fluctuations demanded by the load with the energy stored in the SC bank. In basic steady state operation the SC is discharged when the load power is greater than the average power. Correspondingly, the SC is charged from the mains when the load power is smaller than the average power. The control of the system is based on the p-q theory and the functionality of the system is verified by computer simulations with Matlab Simulink in a 250 kW stone crusher application. The simulation results show that the power fluctuations of the load are effectively reduced and the harmful causes, such as voltage flicker at the PCC, are expected to decrease substantially.","doi":"10.1109/PECON.2008.4762615","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752630/4762428/04762615.pdf","startPage":"977","endPage":"982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECON.2008.4762615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power compensator for high power fluctuating loads with a supercapacitor bank energy storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power compensator for high power fluctuating loads with a supercapacitor bank energy storage","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469404","htmlLink":"/document/4762615/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power compensator for high power fluctuating loads with a supercapacitor bank energy storage","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075039S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752630","isNumber":"4762428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752630","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4762428","articleId":"4762615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4762644,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

Occurrences related to over and undervoltage and line overloading have been responsible for undesirable power system collapse leading to partial or even complete blackouts. This paper presents a research work on artificial neural network (ANN) to examine whether the power system is secured under steady-state operating conditions. The ANN gauges the bus voltages and the line flow conditions. Using the method, detailed load flow study is can be omitted provided that the data supplied to ANN sufficiently cover these operating constraints. A methodology using minimum number of cases from the available large number of contingencies in terms of their impact on the system security has been developed. For training, data from Newton Raphson load flow analysis are used. The artificial neural network has been developed using multilayer feed forward network with backpropagation algorithm. The input variables to the network are loadings of the lines and the voltage magnitude of the load buses. The algorithms are initially tested on the 5 bus and verified on the IEEE-14 bus test system. The results obtained from both test systems indicate that ANN method is comparable in accuracy to the Newton Raphson load flow method with enhanced computational time taken in the process.","doi":"10.1109/PECON.2008.4762653","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1178","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752630/4762428/04762653.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECON.2008.4762653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static security assessment using artificial neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Power system security","System testing","Voltage","Load flow analysis","Backpropagation algorithms","Power systems","Steady-state","Data security","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","load flow","neural nets","Newton-Raphson method","power engineering computing","power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static security assessment","artificial neural network","power system deregulation","steady-state operating conditions","line flow conditions","Newton Raphson load flow analysis","multilayer feed forward network","backpropagation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Static security assessment","Artificial Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Static security assessment using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762653/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469438","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static security assessment using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061302S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752630","isNumber":"4762428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752630","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4762428","articleId":"4762653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4762668,"authors":[{"name":"S.

of global warming and exhaustion of fossil fuels. Many of the distributed generations are set up in the vicinity of the customer, with the advantage that this decreases transmission losses and transmission capacity. However, output power generated from natural energy such as wind power, photovoltaic generations, etc, which is distributed generation, is influenced by meteorological conditions. Therefore if the distributed generation increases with conventional control schemes, it is expected that the voltage variation of each node becomes a problem. This paper proposes a decentralized control of distribution voltage with distributed installations, such as load ratio control transformer (LRT), SSteptep voltage regulator (SVR), shunt capacitor (SC), shunt reactor (ShR), and static Var compensator (SVC). Neural network (NN) is used to determine the operation of the control device.The optimal data is created by genetic algorithm. By using the optimal data for training of NN, the operation of the control device can approach the optimal operation without the communication infrastructures. Furthermore, the decentralized control has the merit of robustness against faults of communication lines and local rapid voltage variation. In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulations are carried out for a distribution network model with photovoltaic (PV) generators.","doi":"10.1109/PECON.2008.4762729","startPage":"1557","endPage":"1562","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECON.2008.4762729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762428","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752630/4762428/04762729.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized voltage control in distribution system using neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762729/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Decentralized voltage control in distribution system using neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762729/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10469505","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized voltage control in distribution system using neural network","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063448S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752630","isNumber":"4762428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752630","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4762428","articleId":"4762729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4762736,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Reza Gholami","affiliation":["University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohamad Reza","lastName":"Gholami","id":"37085987906"},{"name":"Seied Hadi Hoseini","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Seied Hadi","lastName":"Hoseini","id":"37867950200"},{"name":"Meisam Mohamad Taheri","affiliation":["University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Meisam","lastName":"Mohamad Taheri","id":"37085987571"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2404-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2405-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762736","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system reliability","Interconnected systems","Particle swarm optimization","Power system economics","Power generation economics","Sampling methods","Power system faults","State-space methods","Particle tracking","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power composite system annualized reliability index","particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithms","probability state space","IEEE RTS-79"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Composite System","Annualized Reliability Indices","Particle Swarm Optimization","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762736","abstract":"The primary function of a electric power system is to supply customers, with electrical energy as economically as possible and with an acceptable degree of reliability.

This paper presents methodologies for dynamic modeling, visual/haptic display and model validation of cell injection. We first investigate the challenging issues in the modeling of the bio-mechanical properties of living cells. We propose a dynamic model to simulate cell deformation mainly determined by the cytoplasm and the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is organized as a tensegrity structure including microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments whereas the cytoplasm is modeled as an homogeneous volume. Both structures are modeled by using FEM with viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt elements. The virtual environment has been implemented with both graphic and haptic interfaces in order to facilitate training of biological cell injection operations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodologies of dynamic cell injection techniques using FEM biomechanical modeling","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","doi":"10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762805","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753967/4762753/04762805.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Methodologies of dynamic cell injection techniques using FEM biomechanical modeling","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762805/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10460061","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methodologies of dynamic cell injection techniques using FEM biomechanical modeling","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111245S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753967","isNumber":"4762753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753967","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4762753","articleId":"4762805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4762811,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Sup","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Sup","id":"37596693500"},{"name":"Huseyin Atakan Varol","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Huseyin Atakan","lastName":"Varol","id":"37546762800"},{"name":"Jason Mitchell","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Mitchell","id":"37289453900"},{"name":"Thomas Withrow","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Withrow","id":"37571991100"},{"name":"Michael Goldfarb","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Goldfarb","id":"37284476400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2882-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2883-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1782"}],"articleNumber":"4762811","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":1289},"abstract":"This paper presents an overview of the design and control of an electrically powered knee and ankle prosthesis.

presents the characterization of the position and stiffness open loop controller for the NEURARM bio-inspired joint. A novel antagonistic non-linear actuation scheme is proposed for the NEURARM platform, a 2 DoF planar robotic arm that has been developed to imitate the principal functional features of the human arm for planar movements. The NEURARM joint has the actuation scheme based on a contractile element (a hydraulic piston) in series with a non-linear elastic element, able to mimic the force-elongation characteristic of the muscle-tendon complex. The non-linear spring is obtained by a linear tension spring rendered non-linear by means of a specifically designed mechanism. Such actuation scheme allows the implementation of control strategies based on equilibrium point and impedance control hypotheses of human motor behavior. The preliminary results of the characterization of the open loop joint stiffness and position controller are presented.","doi":"10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762817","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753967/4762753/04762817.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of the NEURARM bio-inspired joint position and stiffness open loop controller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762817/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of the NEURARM bio-inspired joint position and stiffness open loop controller","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10460071","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762817/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of the NEURARM bio-inspired joint position and stiffness open loop controller","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068481S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753967","isNumber":"4762753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753967","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4762753","articleId":"4762817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4762833,"authors":[{"name":"Kyle B.

Here, we present a functional needle steering system that integrates two components: (1) a patient-specific 2D pre- and intraoperative planner that finds an achievable route to a target within a planar slice of tissue (Stochastic Motion Roadmap), and (2) a low-level image-guided feedback controller that keeps the needle tip within that slice. The planner generates a sequence of circular arcs that can be realized by interleaving pure insertions with 180deg rotations of the needle shaft. This pre-planned sequence is updated in realtime at regular intervals. Concurrently, the low-level image-based controller servos the needle to remain close to the desired plane between plan updates. Both planner and controller are predicated on a previously developed kinematic nonholonomic model of beveltip needle steering. We use slighly different needles here that have a small bend near the tip, so we extend the model to account for discontinuities of the tip position caused by 180deg rotations. Further, during large rotations of the needle base, we maintain the desired tip angle by compensating for torsional compliance in the needle shaft, neglected in previous needle steering work. By integrating planning, control, and torsion compensation, we demonstrate both accurate targeting and obstacle avoidance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated planning and image-guided control

It has been designed and developed toward the goal of single port surgery. The device is fully inserted into the body cavity and affixed to the abdominal wall. It contains pan and tilt axes to move the camera under simple and intuitive joystick control. A polarization-based stereoscopic display is used to view the images in 3D. The camerapsilas mechanical design is based upon a single camera prototype we have previously built. We have run calibration tests on the camera and used it to track surgical tools in 3D in real-time. We have also used it in a number of live animal tests that included surgical procedures such as appendectomy, running the bowel, suturing, and nephrectomy. The experiments suggest that the device may be easier to use than a normal laparoscope since there is no special training needed for operators. The Pan/Tilt functions provide a large imaging volume that is not restricted by the fulcrum point of a standard laparoscope. Finally, the 3-D imaging system significantly improves the visualization and depth perception of the surgeon.","doi":"10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762870","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753967/4762753/04762870.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Insertable stereoscopic 3D surgical imaging device with pan and tilt","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762870/","displayDocTitle":"Insertable stereoscopic 3D surgical imaging device with pan and tilt","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10460118","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762870/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Insertable stereoscopic 3D surgical imaging device with pan and tilt","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078731S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753967","isNumber":"4762753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753967","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4762753","articleId":"4762870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4762872,"authors":[{"name":"Sarthak Misra","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sarthak","lastName":"Misra","id":"37536488800"},{"name":"Kyle B.

As a first step toward modeling the mechanics of deflection of the needle, we determine the forces at the bevel tip. In order to find the forces acting at the needle tip, we measure rupture toughness and nonlinear material elasticity parameters of several soft tissue simulant gels and chicken tissue. We incorporate these physical parameters into a finite element model that includes both contact and cohesive zone models to simulate tissue cleavage. We investigate the sensitivity of the tip forces to tissue rupture toughness, linear and nonlinear tissue elasticity, and needle tip bevel angle. The model shows that the tip forces are sensitive to the rupture toughness.

In this paper we describe the design of the rHEA, which is a novel, custom-designed combination of a rotational hydraulic actuator and a symmetric torsion spring. The rHEA can also be used as a springless hydraulic actuator for stiffer admittance control, or for isometric large-torque measurements of up to 100 Nm, by locking specific components in the design. Our implementation of HEA required alterations to the existing theoretical models to account for (1) our long flexible tubes between the valve and cylinder, and (2) the influence of the pressure feedback on the valve flow. These newly adapted models gave the best fits on the frequency response functions from our open- and closed-loop identification experiments, and might even provide a better fit for the data in the original publication of the theoretical models. Multi-sine identification showed the torque-tracking bandwidth restricted to 18 Hz for a constant spectral-density reference signal of 20 nm, mostly due the transport delays in the long flexible tubes. The measured torque resolution was better then 0.01 Nm. The delivered torque resolution was below 1 Nm, although at those small amplitudes, the output signal was accompanied by significant phase lead indicating some unaccounted for non-linearities in the actuator. When manipulated manually by forefinger and thumb, almost no distortion torques were felt during minimal-impedance and virtual-spring control. The symmetric torsion spring proved difficult to model correctly, and finding the best design became an iterative process. The spring in the prototype, used for the measurements as reported in this study, had a stiffness and maximum torque below those theoretically calculated, limiting the desired output to 22 Nm. With our latest spring design for the actuators in the Limpact, the maximum output torque is increased to 50 Nm.","doi":"10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762873","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753967/4762753/04762873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762753","startPage":"881","endPage":"888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a rotational hydro-elastic actuator for an active upper-extremity rehabilitation exoskeleton","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a rotational hydro-elastic actuator for an active upper-extremity rehabilitation exoskeleton","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762873/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10460121","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4762873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a rotational hydro-elastic actuator for an active upper-extremity rehabilitation exoskeleton","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067349S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753967","isNumber":"4762753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753967","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4762753","articleId":"4762873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4762877,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Reza Sadeghi Neshat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Canadian Surgical Technologies & Advanced Robotics (CSTAR), University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza Sadeghi","lastName":"Neshat","id":"38192194200"},{"name":"Rajni V.

As a step towards the creation of robots that provide comparable assistance, we present a biologically inspired robot capable of obeying many of the same commands and exploiting the same environmental modifications as service dogs. The robot responds to a subset of the 71 verbal commands listed in the service dog training manual used by Georgia Canines for Independence. In our implementation, the human directs the robot by giving a verbal command and illuminating a task-relevant location with an off-the-shelf green laser pointer. We also describe a novel and inexpensive way to engineer the environment in order to help assistive robots perform useful tasks with generality and robustness. In particular, we show that by tying or otherwise affixing colored towels to doors and drawers an assistive robot can robustly open these doors and drawers in a manner similar to a service dog. This is analogous to the common practice of tying bandannas or handkerchiefs to door handles and drawer handles in order to enable service dogs to operate them. This method has the advantage of simplifying both the perception and physical interaction required to perform the task. It also enables the robot to use the same small set of behaviors to perform a variety of tasks across distinct doors and drawers. We report quantitative results for our assistive robot when performing assistive tasks in response to user commands in a modified environment. In our tests, the robot successfully opened two different drawers in 18 out of 20 trials (90%), closed a drawer in 9 out of 10 trials (90%), and opened a door that required first operating a handle and then pushing it open in 8 out of 10 trials (80%).

The low weight paths in the code trellis which give large contributions to the error probability in the signal-to-noise ratio region of interest for practical communication systems are eliminated, so that they do not appear in the overall code trellis after interleaving. The proposed interleaver improves the code error performance at moderate to high SNR and considerably increases the asymptotic slope of the error probability curves. As a result, the bit error rate and frame error rate performance of turbo codes are improved, and the ldquoerror floorrdquo is reduced considerably. This paper analyzes the impact of weight-2, 3, 4 and 5 input sequences on the codewords. Considering all these low weight inputs, a set of condition is developed and this constraint set is suggested to be used with the S-random interleaving algorithm. This improved algorithm can eliminate or decrease the low free distance of codewords.","doi":"10.1109/AMTA.2008.4762996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMTA.2008.4762996","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749420/4762962/04762996.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified interleaver design to reduce error floor in turbo codes for wireless communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modified interleaver design to reduce error floor in turbo codes for wireless communication","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762996/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762996/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified interleaver design to reduce error floor in turbo codes for wireless communication","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031266S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749420","isNumber":"4762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749420","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4762962","articleId":"4762996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4762998,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Salim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, MNIT, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Salim","id":"38186732500"},{"name":"Kirti Vyas","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, MNIT, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Kirti","lastName":"Vyas","id":"38191297100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2690-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2691-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4762998","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"abstract":"For WLAN applications frequency synchronization is one of the most important issues. The preamble allows the receiver to use efficient maximum likelihood algorithms to estimate and correct for the frequency offset, before the actual information portion of the packet starts. In order to increase the performance and provide frequency synchronization in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems, we propose a new time domain approach for frequency synchronization algorithm. For this we first derive a data-aided maximum-likelihood estimator that operates on the received time domain signal. Several other type of synchronization algorithm has been proposed in different forms which are quite complex. In this method the training information required is at least two consecutive repeated symbols. As a note, the preamble of the WLAN standards satisfies this requirement for both the short and long training symbols. Computer simulation result show that the estimator performs well in a frequency selective slow Rayleigh fading channel as well as in an additive white Gaussian noise channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749420/4762962/04762998.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"613","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/AMTA.2008.4762998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMTA.2008.4762998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4762998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement in OFDM wireless LANS with a novel frequency synchronization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Wireless LAN","Local area networks","Frequency synchronization","Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Computer simulation","Fading","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","digital simulation","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance improvement","wireless LAN","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","time domain approach","frequency synchronization algorithm","data-aided maximum-likelihood estimator","computer simulation","Rayleigh fading channel","additive white Gaussian noise channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency offset","OFDM","synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4762998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement in OFDM wireless LANS with a novel frequency synchronization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4762998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468992","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement in OFDM wireless LANS with a novel frequency synchronization","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049637S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749420","isNumber":"4762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749420","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4762962","articleId":"4762998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4763004,"authors":[{"name":"Vidya Sagar Chintakindi","affiliation":["Department ofETV&ECE, National Institute of Technical Teacher''s Training and Research, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Vidya Sagar","lastName":"Chintakindi","id":"38188644300"},{"name":"Shyam Sundar Pattnaik","affiliation":["Department ofETV&ECE, National Institute of Technical Teacher''s Training and Research, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Shyam Sundar","lastName":"Pattnaik","id":"37328921000"},{"name":"O.P.

With recent advances in electromagnetic computer-aided design (CAD), the design of microstrip antenna has been benefited from the utilization of accurate numerical methods. Recently the particle swarm optimization (PSO) was introduced to the electromagnetic community to calculate microstrip patch antenna parameters. In this paper, the authors have explored its potential by using it in accurate determination of resonant frequency of equilateral triangular microstrip patch (ETMP) antenna. The results obtained have been compared with that of GA and experimental values. The results are in good agreement thus encouraging the use of PSO for antenna design.","doi":"10.1109/AMTA.2008.4763004","startPage":"20","endPage":"22","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749420/4762962/04763004.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMTA.2008.4763004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant frequency of equilateral triangular microstrip patch antenna using particle swarm optimization technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Microstrip antennas","Microstrip components","Patch antennas","Particle swarm optimization","Design automation","Genetic algorithms","Evolution (biology)","Biological cells","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","electrical engineering computing","microstrip antennas","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant frequency","equilateral triangular microstrip patch antenna","particle swarm optimization technique","wireless communication systems","electromagnetic computer-aided design","electromagnetic community"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ETMP","PSO","CAD","Resonant frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4763004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Resonant frequency of equilateral triangular microstrip patch antenna using particle swarm optimization technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4763004/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant frequency of equilateral triangular microstrip patch antenna using particle swarm optimization technique","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055168S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749420","isNumber":"4762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749420","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4762962","articleId":"4763004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4763006,"authors":[{"name":"Tanushree Bose","affiliation":["Birla Institute of Technology, University Polytechnic, Mesra, India"],"firstName":"Tanushree","lastName":"Bose","id":"38186128700"},{"name":"Vibha Rani Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, University Polytechnic, Mesra, India"],"firstName":"Vibha Rani","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37329914600"},{"name":"Nisha Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, University Polytechnic, Mesra, India"],"firstName":"Nisha","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37333435500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2690-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2691-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4763006","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Broadband antennas","Antennas and propagation","Bandwidth","Artificial neural networks","Wireless communication","Aperture antennas","Wire","Ultra wideband antennas","Ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","microwave antennas","monopole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network model","monopole antenna design","microwave antennas","feed forward back propagation algorithm","IE3D software","frequency 4.5 GHz to 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monopole Antenna","Back Propagation Algorithm","Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4763006","abstract":"In this paper, a neural network model is proposed which can be used for designing any monopole antenna whose element is square shaped and required to exhibit a wide band characteristics.

The design of double-disc RF window was carried out for a specific 42 GHz gyrotron, while the design of pillbox-type RF window was carried out for a specific 2.856 GHz klystron. A recent popular and efficient swarm intelligence based method - particle swarm optimization - was employed to get optimum geometrical parameters of RF windows. In order to get optimum trade-off between matching of resonant frequency and minimizing power reflections, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) was used. The results show the effectiveness of the method for the design of a large class of high power devices and components.","doi":"10.1109/AMTA.2008.4763035","startPage":"34","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMTA.2008.4763035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762962","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749420/4762962/04763035.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of RF window using Multi-objective particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4763035/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of RF window using Multi-objective particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4763035/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10459757","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of RF window using Multi-objective particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Jaipur, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070416S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749420","isNumber":"4762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749420","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4762962","articleId":"4763035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4763121,"authors":[{"name":"Sunil Joshi","affiliation":["Deptt of ECE, MPUAT, Udaipur, India"],"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37288595100"},{"name":"Sandeep Sancheti","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Sancheti","id":"37298798800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2690-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2691-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4763121","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loss measurement","Propagation losses","Radio transmitters","Frequency","Attenuation measurement","Vegetation","Tree graphs","Predictive models","Receivers","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave scattering","millimetre wave measurement","millimetre wave propagation","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["foliage loss measurement","tropical trees","propagation channel","signal attenuation","vegetation effects","Indian deserts","leaf size","leaf density","tree canopy","attenuation characteristics","millimeter wave frequency","frequency 35 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Foliage","Milimeter wave","Tropical tree"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4763121","doi":"10.1109/AMTA.2008.4763121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AMTA.2008.4763121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762962","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749420/4762962/04763121.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Foliage loss measurements of tropical trees at 35 GHz","abstract":"The presence of foliage in the propagation channel can lead to severe signal attenuation, and thus the effects of vegetation in the propagation environment need to be considered in any prediction model.

Accurate estimating price is the most essential task and the basis for any decision making and developing biding strategies. In this paper artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to forecast electricity price. ANNs have been used successfully in many forecasting applications recently. Historical data of weighted average prices in electricity market that cleared with pay as bid settlement rule and also forecasted electricity demand are used to train neural networks (NN) model. The data for historical electricity prices are considered by two criterion of temperature and load in order to improve training. Data are categorized in to two seasonal parts of warm and cold days and also they are categorized by three loads level of low, normal and peak. To support better accuracy of estimating prices six different NN architectures are modeled for combination of the criterions, the NN also selected electricity prices of similar days in previous year. In the end, the results of forecasting prices of ANNs are compared with the results obtained from regression model. There is confirmed that, AANs have better performance comparing to traditional method in forecasting electricity prices.","doi":"10.1109/EPC.2008.4763300","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Canada Electric Power Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPC.2008.4763300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4763280","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Canada Electric Power Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749248/4763280/04763300.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electricity price forecasting in Iranian electricity market applying Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4763300/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Electricity price forecasting in Iranian electricity market applying Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4763300/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10468975","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electricity price forecasting in Iranian electricity market applying Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-01202009-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050618S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749248","isNumber":"4763280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749248","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4763280","articleId":"4763300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4763308,"authors":[{"name":"Fahd Hashiesh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Power and Machines Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4749248/4763280/4763308/4763308-photo-5-source-small.gif","p":["Fahd Hashiesh: PhD student at Electrical Power and Machines, Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Egypt.

The ANN makes use of the advent of phasor measurements units (PMU) for real-time prediction. Rate of change of bus voltages and angles for six cycles after fault tripping and/or clearing is used to train a two layers ANN. Coherent groups of generators which swing together is identified through an algorithm based on PMU measurements. A remedial action scheme (RAS) is applied to counteract the system instability by splitting the system into islands and initiate under-frequency load shedding actions.

Moreover, most of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, are uncertain and uncontrollable. In order to overcome these drawbacks, the rejected energy can be applied to pumped storage power plants and reutilized via hydro-turbines when needed. Optimal sizing of such power plants is crucial in enhancing the recovery of the rejected energy. In this paper, optimal sizing of pumped storage power plants for increasing the penetration of renewable energies are studied. Both technical and economical aspects are considered. The analysed methods include evaluating the operation and optimal sizing of such systems through assessing the attainability of various objectives using single or multi-objective optimizations, parametric studies, and sensitivity tests. The results of this paper demonstrate the leading role of a well-optimized design for technical and economic viability of such systems.","doi":"10.1109/EPC.2008.4763324","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Canada Electric Power Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Canada Electric Power Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749248/4763280/04763324.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPC.2008.4763324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4763280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis for increasing the penetration of renewable energies by optimal sizing of pumped-storage power plants","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4763324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An analysis for increasing the penetration of renewable energies by optimal sizing of pumped-storage power plants","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459659","htmlLink":"/document/4763324/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis for increasing the penetration of renewable energies by optimal sizing of pumped-storage power plants","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-01202009-00044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096969S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749248","isNumber":"4763280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749248","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4763280","articleId":"4763324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4763325,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The fault identification prior to reclosing is based on optimized artificial neural network associated with standard error back-propagation, Levenberg Marquardt algorithm and resilient back-propagation training algorithms together with Taguchipsilas method. The algorithms are developed using MATLABtrade software. A range of faults are simulated on EHV modeled transmission line using SimPowerSytemstrade, and the spectra of the fault data are analyzed using fast Fourier transform which facilitates extraction of distinct features of each type of fault. For both training and testing purposes, the neural network is fed with the normalized energies of the DC component, the fundamental and the first four harmonics of the faulted voltages. The developed algorithm is effectively trained, verified and validated with a set of training, dedicated testing and validation data respectively.","doi":"10.1109/EPC.2008.4763325","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Canada Electric Power Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPC.2008.4763325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4763280","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Canada Electric Power Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749248/4763280/04763325.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autoreclosure in extra high voltage lines using Taguchi\u2019s method and optimized neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4763325/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Autoreclosure in extra high voltage lines using Taguchi\u2019s method and optimized neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4763325/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10459660","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autoreclosure in extra high voltage lines using Taguchi\u2019s method and optimized neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-01202009-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067215S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4749248","isNumber":"4763280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749248","xplore-issue":"4763280","articleId":"4763325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4763380,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Futures ICs and passives will also decrease in size, e.g. for RF-ID applications forecast die sizes are smaller than 250 ?m, thicknesses less than 50 ?m and pitches way below 100 ?m. Passives, if not directly integrated into the system carrier, will be even smaller. Touchless and self-assembly based procedures seem to be a promising method for handling miniaturized components not directly fabricated at the very place where they are needed. Based on the \"electrowetting on dielectrics\" effect (EWOD) - a contactless handling technology well known from lab-on-chip applications for liquid transport, sorting, mixing and splitting - is used as a basis for microelectronics assembly purposes on standard printed circuit boards. Handling shall be feasible for miniaturized components as duplets, smallest SMDs as well as for nano-scaled building blocks. The physical principle is a change in the droplet contact angle of a droplet when immersed into an electrical field, an effect that can be used for droplet movement and potentially for component transport. The process flow under evaluation starts with positioning of a droplet, containing a component, on a hydrophobic surface of the carrier substrate with rough accuracy. Using the mentioned electro wetting effect the droplet will be moved quickly until the desired position is reached. The precise placement of the droplet in ?m range takes place by means of field gradients and local manipulation of the carrier surface. The assembly is finished with the evaporation of the component containing droplets and the transfer of all components to the final substrate. The experimental work on EWOD described in this paper includes electrical layout, substrate manufacturing, hydrophobic surface modification and droplet handling in combination with a process simulation. The electrowetting conveying system is simulated using the Multi Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics method (MDPD), where clusters of fluid molecules are represented by coarse grained particles. Wetting behavior is introduced by position-fixed wall particles: the force between a wall and a fluid particle is adapted such that the required contact angle emerges. The electrowetting model uses the Lippmann equation to find the influence of the applied voltage on the wetting behavior, i.e., the attractive forces between wall and fluid particles are modified to simulate the electrostatic forces on the contact line. The micro parts are also simulated by connected particles with special interaction forces for (almost) rigid body motion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contactless Component Handling on PCB Using EWOD Principles","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/EPTC.2008.4763432","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753888/4763398/04763432.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPTC.2008.4763432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4763398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4763432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4763432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Contactless Component Handling on PCB Using EWOD Principles","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4763432/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444925","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contactless Component Handling on PCB Using EWOD Principles","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"EPTC-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094714S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753888","isNumber":"4763398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753888","xplore-issue":"4763398","articleId":"4763432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4763434,"authors":[{"name":"Liwei Zhao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano Fabrication Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liwei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37310361700"},{"name":"Hongguang Liao","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Engineering,Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hongguang","lastName":"Liao","id":"37652540200"},{"name":"Min Miao","affiliation":["Inst. of Information Microsystem, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China","National Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano Fabrication Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Miao","id":"37300877300"},{"name":"Yufeng Jin","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano Fabrication Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290208700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2117-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2118-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4763434","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Silicon","Packaging machines","Etching","Microwave devices","Microwave theory and techniques","Transmission line theory","Finite element methods","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","integrated circuit interconnections","system-in-package","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["through silicon via","I-shaped TSV structure","3D SiP","microwave transmission line theory","finite element full-wave analysis","vertical interconnections"]}],"abstract":"A TSV (Through Silicon Via) structure with I-shaped structure for 3D packaging is proposed in this paper.

Biomedical research is increasingly an online activity as scientists combine and explore different types of data in cyberspace, putting together complementary views on problems that lead to new insights and discoveries. An e-Science paradigm is thus emerging; the biomedical community is looking for tools to help access, query, and analyze a myriad of data in cyberspace. Specifically, the biomedical community is beginning to embrace technologies such as ontologies to integrate scientific knowledge, standard syntaxes, and semantics to make biomedical knowledge explicit, and the semantic Web to establish virtual collaborations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4763656/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2009","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4763656/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10459204","volume":"24","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Annotation and Image Markup: Accessing and Interoperating with the Semantic Content in Medical Imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Annotation and Image Markup: Accessing and Interoperating with the Semantic Content in Medical Imaging","sourcePdf":"mex2009010057.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033712S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9670","isNumber":"4763642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9670","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4763642","articleId":"4763656","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4763671,"authors":[{"name":"David Lopez-Perez","affiliation":["CWiND (Centre for Wireless Network Design), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lopez-Perez","id":"38277422500"},{"name":"Alpar Juttner","affiliation":["CWiND (Centre for Wireless Network Design), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Alpar","lastName":"Juttner","id":"37398645200"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["CWiND (Centre for Wireless Network Design), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-8111-68-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4763671","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Simulated annealing","Greedy algorithms","Interference","Frequency diversity","Throughput","Wireless networks","Technology planning","WiMAX","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","greedy algorithms","OFDM modulation","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","search problems","simulated annealing","telecommunication network planning","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic frequency planning","OFDMA networks","DFP","inter-cell interference","network capacity","radio frequency parameters","radio channel","simulated annealing","tabu search","greedy algorithms","optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"The PowerPoint presentation work has introduced a novel dynamic frequency planning approach to the frequency assignment problem tailored to OFDMA networks.

The current and voltage are measured independently so that the dielectric losses in insulation can be calculated. Such measurements can be made up to the breakdown voltage of the material being tested. The development of the cathode ray tube and its auxiliary apparatus is discussed. Measurements of dielectric losses, power factors, and currents, for varnished cloths and oil-treated pressboard, are given. The measurements have been made at 60 cycles at different voltages, temperatures, and moisture contents in the case of pressboard. Curves are given showing the losses, power factors and currents plotted against voltage, temperature, and per cent absorbed moisture. Empirical equations are derived for all the curves. It is shown that watt losses may vary from the 1.32 to the 2.52 power of the voltage. The losses and currents can be expressed by an equation of the form K1 + K2 Yn, where Y may be temperature in deg. cent. or per cent absorbed moisture. The same form of equation holds for the power factors up to about 85 per cent. The equations given show that the exponent n may vary from about four to seven, depending on the conditions of the tests and on the nature of the insulations.","doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1915.4765275","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/4765262/04765275.pdf","startPage":"1627","endPage":"1691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1915.4765275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Investigation of Dielectic Losses with the Cathode Ray Tube","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4765275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1915","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1915","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765275/","displayDocTitle":"An Investigation of Dielectic Losses with the Cathode Ray Tube","volume":"XXXIV","issue":"2","publicationDate":"July 1915","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation of Dielectic Losses with the Cathode Ray Tube","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-vXXXIV-n2-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044009S","chronDate":"July  1915","isNumber":"4765262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4765275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1915","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4765570,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It is recommended that only that part of Part I up to formula (33) and the portion dealing with star-delta transformations be read before proceeding with Part II. Part I deals with the resolution of unsymmetrical groups of numbers into symmetrical groups. These numbers may represent rotating vectors of systems of operators. A new operator termed the sequence operator is introduced which simplifies the manipulation. Formulas are derived for three-phase circuits. Star-delta transformations for symmetrical co-ordinates are given and expressions for power deduced. A short discussion of harmonics in three-phase systems is given. Part II deals with the practical application of this method to symmetrical rotating machines operating on unsymmetrical circuits. General formulas are derived and such special cases, as the single-phase induction motor, synchronous motor-generator, phase converters of various types, are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1918","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1918","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765570/","volume":"XXXVII","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1918","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Method of Symmetrical Co-Ordinates Applied to the Solution of Polyphase Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Method of Symmetrical Co-Ordinates Applied to the Solution of Polyphase Networks","sourcePdf":"T-AIEE-vXXXVII-n2-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031319S","chronDate":"July  1918","isNumber":"4765558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"257","articleId":"4765570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1918","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4765572,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A short, reliable method is given in the form of curves, Figs. 20A, B, C, making the calculation from design sheet data a matter of a few minutes. Table I shows a comparison of calculated and test values (obtained from saturation and synchronous impedance curves) for 138 machines, ranging from high-speed turbine generators to the low-speed engine type. Three points were brought out during the investigation: (1) That in polyphase machines, the armature self-inductive reactance, just as the armature reaction, is a polyphase, not a single-phase phenomenon, and therefore the mutual induction of phases in a three-phase machine increases the effective self-induction of each phase by approximately 50 per cent over the single phase value, while in two-phase machines, in which the mutual induction of phases is zero, the effective self-induction of the phase is the same for two-phase or single-phase operation. (2) That the variation of armature reactance during the cycle, due to salient-pole construction, is practically eliminated in Y-connected, three-phase machines for the reason that the variation, consisting almost entirely of a third harmonic, is cancelled in such machines. This leaves, in effect, a uniform reluctance for the leakage flux emanating from the tooth tips.

Direct current motors are employed in photovoltaic water pumping systems; therefore, the understanding of the system operation and the matching of the system components (solar cells, dc motor type, and load type) are important factors of the system design. Since the solar cell generator in a nonlinear and time-dependent power supply with an output that varies with the insolation (hourly and daily), the performance characteristics of the dc motor are different when supplied by a solar cell generator than when supplied by a conventional constant voltage source. The transient solution was obtained by using an available computer program - SUPER SCEPTRE. The separately - excited (or permanent magnet) motor with a ventilator load was found to be the most suitable for the solar cell generator. The series motor is quite acceptable, but the shunt motor gives poor performance. In all cases the ventilator load is more compatible with the solar cell generator than with the constant load.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1986.4765665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765658/04765665.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1986.4765665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765658","startPage":"17","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Starting and Steady-State Characteristics of DC Motors Powered by Solar Cell Generators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4765665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Starting and Steady-State Characteristics of DC Motors Powered by Solar Cell Generators","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Starting and Steady-State Characteristics of DC Motors Powered by Solar Cell Generators","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-1-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018404S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4765658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"119","articleId":"4765665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4765666,"authors":[{"name":"Z.M.

The possibility of using the trajectories obtained for the machine parameters in detecting incipient faults is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1986.4765719","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765687/04765719.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"192","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1986.4765719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observers for Tracking of Synchronous Machine Parameters and Detection of Incipient Faults","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1986","displayDocTitle":"Observers for Tracking of Synchronous Machine Parameters and Detection of Incipient Faults","volume":"EC-1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"June 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observers for Tracking of Synchronous Machine Parameters and Detection of Incipient Faults","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-1-n2-32.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043973S","chronDate":"June  1986","isNumber":"4765687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4765719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4765755,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The newly introduced integrated field network (IFN) method was used throughout this work. The IFN method, which is detailed in a companion paper, is based on simultaneously solving the dynamic equations of the machine system network, using machine winding parameters (inductances and emfs) which are determined from numerical solutions of the nonlinear magnetic field prevailing in the machine cores for the corresponding winding currents. These field solutions and corresponding machine parameters are updated at every time step of the solution of the dynamic equations. The results presented here document effects of the shorting of a portion of an armature phase winding on the dynamic performance of a 15 hp (11.2 kw), 120 volts samarium-cobalt permanent magnet brushless dc motor. A comparison of the current, inductance, enf, torque and power time profiles of the motor system with and without partial armature winding failure (short) is given here. These studies are of importance in motor system security and redundancy considerations. The dramatic change of the values of machine parameters upon occurrence of the partial short circuits demonstrate that conventional solution methods would have left much to be desired.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"EC-2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transient Analysis of Partial Armature Short Circuit in an Electronically Commutated Permanent Magnet Motor System using an Integrated Nonlinear Magnetic Field-Network Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Analysis of Partial Armature Short Circuit in an Electronically Commutated Permanent Magnet Motor System using an Integrated Nonlinear Magnetic Field-Network Model","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-2-n1-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039636S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4765793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4765808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4765811,"authors":[{"name":"J C Balda","affiliation":["University of Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"firstName":"J C","lastName":"Balda","id":"37275272200"},{"name":"R G Harley","affiliation":["University of Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"firstName":"R G","lastName":"Harley","id":"37274391200"},{"name":"E Eitelberg","affiliation":["University of Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"firstName":"E","lastName":"Eitelberg","id":"37542481000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"4765811","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Shafts","Turbogenerators","Shunt (electrical)","Inductors","Power generation","Power system modeling","Mathematical model","Control systems","Capacitors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4765811","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1987.4765811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1987.4765811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765793/04765811.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping of Torsional Shaft Oscillations in Two Interacting Neighbouring Turbogenerators","abstract":"This paper investigates the damping of torsional oscillations in a power station with two identical 1072 MVA generating units connected to an infinite bus through a series capacitor compensated transmission line. It considers a single common controlled shunt reactor to damp torsional oscillations of both turbogenerator shafts. To overcome the mathematical difficulties arising from having to use a high order model of the power system, together with powerful techniques for controller design, the order of the system model is firstly reduced by considering an 'equivalent' single generator and then applying a known model reduction method to this 'equivalent' generator's model. The transient response of the complete unreduced system is then evaluated when the two generator units are equipped with this single common controlled shunt reactor (1SR) and compared against the case when each generator unit has its own separate controlled shunt reactor (2SR). The results show that torsional oscillations in the turbogenerator shafts of such a multimachine system can be damped by the action of a single common controlled shunt reactor; nevertheless, a system where each turbogenerator is equipped with its own individual shunt reactor shows better overall system behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"March 1987","volume":"EC-2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Damping of Torsional Shaft Oscillations in Two Interacting Neighbouring Turbogenerators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of Torsional Shaft Oscillations in Two Interacting Neighbouring Turbogenerators","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-2-n1-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028601S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4765793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4765811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4765812,"authors":[{"name":"V.B.

Fast time responses achieved by the analog section make this part suitable for the study of transient phenomena associated with the interconnected operation of PVs and the utility grid. Its digital counterpart is more appropriate for long-term experimental investigations due to its inherent accuracy and reliability. The combined hybrid simulator offers a versatile and flexible piece of apparatus capable of simulating the performance of any PV array under a variety of operating conditions. The device can be constructed with low-cost components in a compact arrangement offering transportability and ease of operation.

A phase-variable model of a synchronous-generator with up to 2 direct-axis and 3 quadrature-axis dampers where fault current is cleared at fault current zeros is employed to calculate generator airgap torque which results from a severe disturbance on the electrical supply. Using airgap torque, effective amplitude of torque excitation acting on the generator rotor for each eigenfrequency is determined by Fourier analysis. Amplitude of torsional vibration at each shaft section for each modal frequency is then calculated. Shaft torque at each shaft location for each modal frequency is thereby deduced. These components, together with the steady-state component (and that due to rotor swing), are summed as absolute values for all modal frequencies to yield approximate peak torque at critical locations along the shaft following each disturbance. Approximate peak shaft torque estimated by frequency domain analysis is compared in some instances with peak torque predicted by solution of exact differential equations. Presented results illustrate amplitude of torque excitation and shaft torques as a function of fault clearing time for L-L-L and L-L high-voltage system short-circuits, and effect reactive power and system resistance has on damping predominant torsional vibrations in the shaft.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1987.4765846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1987.4765846","startPage":"308","endPage":"320","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765820/04765846.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Fault Clearing and Damper Modelling on Excitation and Decay of Vibrations in Generator Shafts Following Severe Disturbances on the System Supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Fault Clearing and Damper Modelling on Excitation and Decay of Vibrations in Generator Shafts Following Severe Disturbances on the System Supply","publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","volume":"EC-2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765846/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Fault Clearing and Damper Modelling on Excitation and Decay of Vibrations in Generator Shafts Following Severe Disturbances on the System Supply","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-2-n2-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055013S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"4765820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4765846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4765857,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Yih Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Yih","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37271365300"},{"name":"Kan-Lee Liou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kan-Lee","lastName":"Liou","id":"37296604400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"4765857","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":664},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Synchronous generators","Three-term control","Control systems","Power system dynamics","Synchronous machines","Optimal control","Power system transients","Control theory","Power system control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4765857","abstract":"A new technique for the excitation control of a synchronous generator is presented in this paper.

In a matched system, the operation of the load-line is close to the maximum power-line of the solar cell (SC) generator. Some load-lines inherently exhibit a relatively good matching when they are directly connected to the SC generator; for others, the matching is rather poor, and therefore, requires the inclusion of a maximum-power-point-tracker (MPPT) in the system. This present study deals with the performance analysis of six common types of loads that are directly connected to the SC generator, and defines a factor that describes the quality of matching of the load to the solar cells. The results of the study indicate the compatibility of the different loads when powered by solar cells, and will assist the designer of the photovoltaic system in considering whether to include an MPPT. The quality of load matching is defined here as the ratio of the load input power to the SC generator maximum power as a function of the solar insolation, or as a function of the solar time. The six loads are: an ohmic load, a storage battery, an ohmic load and storage battery, a water electrolyzer, a power conditioner--constant power load, and a dc motor driving volumetric and centrifugal pumps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Quality of Load Matching in a Direct-Coupling Photovoltaic System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1987.4765889","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765882/04765889.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1987.4765889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4765889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"The Quality of Load Matching in a Direct-Coupling Photovoltaic System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Quality of Load Matching in a Direct-Coupling Photovoltaic System","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-2-n4-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031294S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4765882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"87","articleId":"4765889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4765898,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Fast risetime surges resulting from circuit breaker switching operations can cause severe voltage stress on the turn insulation due to the non-uniform distribution of voltage across the winding. In order to characterize the surge environment as seen by typical utility motors in normal service, an extensive program of surge monitoring has been undertaken. This work was done as one part of an EPRI funded project to investigate the turn insulation capability of large ac machines. The results of monitoring switching surges for 26 motors controlled by air magnetic circuit breakers and 7 motors controlled by vacuum switchgear in 11 utilities are presented. No significant surges were ever detected during circuit breaker opening operations. Surges with magnitudes as high as 4.6 pu were measured during normal motor starting operations. Tests on a motor switched by an air magnetic circuit breaker, and then a vacuum contactor, showed no significant differences in surge risetimes and magnitudes as recorded at the motor terminals. However vacuum switchgear does give rise to a large number of steep fronted transients for each motor closing operation. Some correlation was found between motor feeder cable types and switching surge characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1987.4765906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765882/04765906.pdf","startPage":"658","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1987.4765906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 1 - Surge Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4765906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765906/","displayDocTitle":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 1 - Surge Monitoring","volume":"EC-2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 1 - Surge Monitoring","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-2-n4-24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042854S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4765882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"40","articleId":"4765906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4765907,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

The motors covered a wide range of voltage class, power rating, insulation type, age and winding design. For most motors, the breakdown voltages were 5 pu or higher which is many times the 1.5 pu strength for 0.1 \u03bcs surges suggested in an IEEE guideline [1]. Testing of individual coils indicated that some coils had very low breakdown voltages probably due to imperfections acquired during coil forming or stator winding. In general, the withstand strength of the motors was 50 to 100% higher than that of individual coils. The interface between the turn insulation and the groundwall was involved in most failures. Tests on two new motors indicate that manufacturers have the capability to build motors with impulse strengths of 10 pu or more.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1987.4765907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765882/04765907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1987.4765907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765882","startPage":"666","endPage":"673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 2 - Impulse Strength","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4765907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 2 - Impulse Strength","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 2 - Impulse Strength","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-2-n4-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055944S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4765882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4765907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4765908,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

The surge strength of the turn insulation of motor windings was determined from destructive tests on 17 stators [6]. The surge voltage magnitude which can strike the motor's terminals was measured on 33 motors during normal operation in several different utility generating stations [5]. The surge strength of most motors exceeds the surge magnitudes which can occur during normal service. The only motors which have a surge strength below the highest surge voltages measured were either damaged from severe aging, or had poorly made turn insulation when compared to other coils in the same stator. Vacuum switchgear does not appear to pose a greater hazard to motor windings than conventional air-magnetic breakers, as long as the vacuum circuit breaker does not interrupt motor starting currents. Improved quality control tests are required to allow manufacturers to identify the few defective coils which may occur in a winding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 3 - Insulation Coordination","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1987.4765908","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765882/04765908.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1987.4765908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4765908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 3 - Insulation Coordination","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turn Insulation Capability of Large AC Motors Part 3 - Insulation Coordination","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-2-n4-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039132S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4765882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4765908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4765909,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

The algorithm was constructed to fit reactances resulting from nonlinear finite-element calculations of steady-state load points covering the operating range (V,P,Q) of the generator. Saturation functions were derived for two generators: Cholla 4, owned by the Arizona Public Service Company, and Bull Run (HP unit), owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The owners of these generators measured steady-state load data for these machines, and the measured load angles and excitation currents were compared with those calculated using the algorithm. Agreement within 2 degrees in angle (max. 3 degrees), and 2 percent in excitation was obtained. This paper describes the fitting process and the comparisons of the results to test data. A companion paper describes increases in power transfer found from coding the algorithm into an existing stability program, and testing the prototype code on an 1100 bus stability study.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1987.4765909","startPage":"680","endPage":"692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1987.4765909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4765882","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4765882/04765909.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation Functions for Synchronous Generators from Finite Elements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4765909/","displayDocTitle":"Saturation Functions for Synchronous Generators from Finite Elements","volume":"EC-2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation Functions for Synchronous Generators from Finite Elements","sourcePdf":"T-EC-vEC-2-n4-27.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031533S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4765882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"56","articleId":"4765909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4765920,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Load flow studies usually furnish a good indication of where they will render maximum benefit. In many instances, they can be installed on primary feeders. A study is made of the optimum location, size, and timing of capacitor banks on feeders with uniformly distributed loads and randomly distributed variable spot loads to evaluate the reduction in costs of active and reactive losses where voltage regulation is no problem. A new simplifying principle is established, taking moments of the loads with respect to feeder resistances or reactances.

While the conventional technique injects and measures the analog signals, the proposed digital modulator injects a digital perturbation and measures the resultant duty cycle modulation. Since the duty cycle signal, derived from all feedback loops, provides the ultimate control of a switching regulator, the loop gain defined at the duty cycle modulator is unique. Employing the digital modulator, this loop gain can be measured even with a switching regulator employing the current injected control. Furthermore, this new technique overcomes false measurement problems found in the conventional technique when the feedback signal at the point where the loop gain is measured contains a pulsating nature.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.1986.4766277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4766266/04766277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.1986.4766277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766266","startPage":"55","endPage":"62","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of Loop Gain with the Digital Modulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of Loop Gain with the Digital Modulator","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"PE-1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of Loop Gain with the Digital Modulator","sourcePdf":"T-PE-vPE-1-n1-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028818S","chronDate":"Jan.  1986","isNumber":"4766266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"49","articleId":"4766277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4766286,"authors":[{"name":"George C.

It leads, via compact and powerful notation, to disciplined modeling and straightforward derivation of small-signal models that describe perturbations about a nominal cyclic steady state. Its usefulness is further illustrated by considering the representation and analysis of a class of symmetries in circuit operation. The results of the application of this methodology to modeling the small-signal dynamics of a series resonant converter are described. The results correlate well with simulation results obtained on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Parity Simulator. What is of greater significance is the fact that the small-signal model is obtained in a completely routine way, starting from a general formulation and working down to the actual circuit; this contrasts with the circuit-specific analyses that are more typical of the power electronics literature. The automatability of this procedure is also discussed, and it is pointed out that the key ingredients for automatic generation of dynamic models from a circuit specification are now available.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.1986.4766286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4766281/04766286.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.1986.4766286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766281","startPage":"76","endPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Approach to Sampled-Data Modeling for Power Electronic Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A General Approach to Sampled-Data Modeling for Power Electronic Circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"PE-1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1986","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Approach to Sampled-Data Modeling for Power Electronic Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-PE-vPE-1-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037765S","chronDate":"April  1986","isNumber":"4766281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"346","articleId":"4766286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4766289,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Redl","affiliation":["Department of Microwave Communications, Technical University of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Redl","id":"37282292800"},{"name":"Bela Molnar","affiliation":["Department of Microwave Communication, Technical University of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Bela","lastName":"Molnar","id":"37293837500"},{"name":"Nathan O.

The results are a) near zero output impedance and audio susceptibility, from dc to nearly the switching frequency, b) much reduced magnitude, duration, and energy content of the output-voltage transient after a transient change of output current or input voltage, and c) smaller size and lower cost for the output filter capacitor. Feed-forward is applicable to both forward and flyback types of converters and to all types of current-mode control. The cost of feed-forward for a forward-type converter is a low-power resistor and a current sensor; a flyback-type converter needs also an analog multiplier-divider integrated circuit (IC). A description is given of the control loop, conditions to achieve extremely good transient response, calculation of the peak deviation of the output voltage for a step load change, practical methods for current feed-forward, and experimental results. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. In the experiments, adding output-current feed-forward reduced the transient deviations of output voltage by factors of 6.7 in magnitude, 50 in duration, and 335 in energy content. The added components were a 1/4-W resistor and a 12-mm ferrite toroid with a 10-turn winding.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4766293/04766303.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.1986.4766303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.1986.4766303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Optimum Dynamic Regulation of DC-DC Converters Using Feed-Forward of Output Current and Input Voltage with Current-Mode Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","Feedforward systems","Voltage control","Costs","Resistors","Analog integrated circuits","Impedance","Switching frequency","Zero voltage switching","Filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","displayDocTitle":"Near-Optimum Dynamic Regulation of DC-DC Converters Using Feed-Forward of Output Current and Input Voltage with Current-Mode Control","volume":"PE-1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1986","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Optimum Dynamic Regulation of DC-DC Converters Using Feed-Forward of Output Current and Input Voltage with Current-Mode Control","sourcePdf":"T-PE-vPE-1-n3-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03026S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"4766293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"163","articleId":"4766303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4766310,"authors":[{"name":"Georg Lutteke","affiliation":["Apparatenfabriek Krefeld, Philips GmbH, Krefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Lutteke","id":"37297526400"},{"name":"Hubert C.

The concept of ``instantaneous torque control'' is introduced as an objective worth pursuing in the application of such digital IC's to drive systems. Instantaneous torque control would in principle permit the fastest possible response and the elimination of torque ripple, along with many other advantages not possible with conventional control algorithms, most of which are set up to control a time-averaged torque. Some of the fundamental principles of instantaneous torque control are developed for the switched reluctance motor, which is used as an example because, like the brushless dc permanent-magnet motor with concentrated windings, it has the potential for rapid response, but it can have appreciable torque ripple with unfavorable firing angles. A reference frame transformation that would eliminate the rotor position from the voltage and torque equations is not known for either of these machines. This opens up a number of interesting questions as to the generality of instantaneous torque control algorithms, and whether they can be incorporated into the general or unified theory of electrical machines.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.1987.4766332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4766322/04766332.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.1987.4766332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous Torque Control of Electric Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766332/","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous Torque Control of Electric Motor Drives","volume":"PE-2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous Torque Control of Electric Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"T-PE-vPE-2-n1-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045494S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"4766322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"104","articleId":"4766332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4766345,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A new circuit-oriented model of the current feedback path is derived which augments the well-known power stage canonical circuit model. The current loop gain, though wide-band, is always stable if the conventional stabilizing ramp is employed but has a relatively small low-frequency value. Consequently, the ``new'' power stage is more usefully modeled by a y-parameter model in which the current loop is not explicit. Expressions for the y parameters are given that are extensions of those previously derived. Another form of the model resembles the original canonical form for duty ratio programming, and shows that current programming effectively introduces lossless series damping that separates widely the two poles of the power stage LC filter. Therefore, although current programming tends to make the power stage output behave as a current source, the contol-to-output voltage transfer function exhibits, in addition to the familiar dominant pole, a second pole at the current loop gain crossover frequency, which may lie anywhere from one-sixth to two-thirds of the switching frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","publicationDate":"April 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","volume":"PE-2","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Topics in Multiple-Loop Regulators and Current-Mode Programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topics in Multiple-Loop Regulators and Current-Mode Programming","sourcePdf":"T-PE-vPE-2-n2-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029065S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"4766337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"272","articleId":"4766345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766348,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry L.

In this model, as in reality, the two critical parameters are varied by 1) adjusting the doping concentration and thickness of a buffer layer included as part of the bipolar transistor base, 2) adjusting the lifetime in the lowly doped bipolar transistor base with no buffer layer included, or by 3) a combination of 1) and 2).

In addition, many noise and interferences, including multiple access interference (MAI), optical beating interference (OBI), and receiverpsilas noise are included in the analysis. Besides, we propose to use the heterodyne detection receiver so that the receiverpsilas sensitivity can be improved. Analytical results show that, under the impact of GVD, the number of supportable users is extremely decreased and the maximum transmission length is remarkably shortened when the normal single mode fiber is used. The main factor that limits the system performance is time skewing. In addition, we show how the impact of GVD is relieved by dispersion-shifted fiber. For example, a system with 32 times 1 Gbit/s users can achieve a maximum transmission length of 111 km when transmitted optical power per bit is -5 dBm.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766388.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the impact of group velocity dispersion on the performance of 2-D WH/TS OCDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical noise","Optical receivers","Optical fiber dispersion","Optical mixing","Optical sensors","Multiple access interference","Optical pulses","Optical propagation","Optical fibers","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical fibre networks","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group velocity dispersion","2-D WH/TS OCDMA systems performance","Gaussian pulse propagation","optical fiber","optical code division multiple access","optical beating interference","heterodyne detection receiver","time skewing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the impact of group velocity dispersion on the performance of 2-D WH/TS OCDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10478229","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the impact of group velocity dispersion on the performance of 2-D WH/TS OCDMA systems","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029224S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","articleId":"4766388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766394,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Arya","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Krishna","lastName":"Arya","id":"38123193500"},{"name":"C.

The ECKF is capable of estimating the parameters and can effectively track the variations of damping constants and frequencies. However, the performance of ECKF has been found to be very sensitive to initial state estimates when one of the proposed model (called model-1) is used for representing the signal. Some of the existing methods of damped signal estimation including HSVD, which belong to the class of batch processing algorithms, are not sensitive to initial conditions. However, these are unsuitable for tracking variations of signal parameters. The proposed algorithm, therefore, uses HSVD to accurately estimate the initial states from few samples of the signal. These estimates are subsequently being used by ECKF to eliminate its sensitivity to initial conditions. The structure of Model-1 is further modified to yield another model structure (called Model-2) to represent the damped signal. The parameters of the damped signal were estimated under variety of noisy conditions by ECKF using both Model-1 & 2. Their effectiveness were compared by computing the the variances of estimates and comparing those with Cramer-Rao (CR) bound. Results of estimation show that Model-2 is more efficient compared to Model-1 and ECKF is capable of accurately tracking the variations in signal parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4766399/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469739","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation of exponentially damped sinusoids using HSVD based extended complex Kalman filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation of exponentially damped sinusoids using HSVD based extended complex Kalman filter","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047398S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766401,"authors":[{"name":"Yemula Pradeep","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology","Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Yemula","lastName":"Pradeep","id":"38497955600"},{"name":"V.

In the proposed application we divide an input fingerprint image into two shares with the help of the basic VC techniques, keeping one with the participant in the form of ID card and saving the other one in the database. This share kept in the database will be the same for all of the participants. While accessing, we will stack the corresponding shares together and compare the obtained image with the provided fresh fingerprint using any modern minutia extraction algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4766425/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10469758","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint based authentication application using visual cryptography methods (Improved ID card)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint based authentication application using visual cryptography methods (Improved ID card)","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045181S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4766426,"authors":[{"name":"Shankhanaad Mallick","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Shankhanaad","lastName":"Mallick","id":"38254195600"},{"name":"Imtiaz Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Imtiaz","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37291472300"},{"name":"Satya Prasad Majumder","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Satya Prasad","lastName":"Majumder","id":"37272715700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2408-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4766426","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"abstract":"This paper proposes an analytical performance evaluation of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) under the combined influence of carrier frequency offset (CFO), phase noise and timing jitter.

Handwritten character recognition has received extensive attention in academic and production fields. The recognition system can be either on-line or off-line. Off-line handwriting recognition is the subfield of optical character recognition. India is a multi-lingual and multi-script country, where eighteen official scripts are accepted and have over hundred regional languages. In this paper we present Zone and Distance metric based feature extraction system. The character centroid is computed and the image is further divided in to n equal zones. Average distance from the character centroid to the each pixel present in the zone is computed. This procedure is repeated for all the zones present in the numeral image. Finally n such features are extracted for classification and recognition. Feed forward back propagation neural network is designed for subsequent classification and recognition purpose.

The estimate of the channel is generalized to provide scope for exploiting the coherence time and the coherence bandwidth for an improved performance. The performance of the channel estimator is analyzed in terms of the mean square estimation error (MSEE) and its impact on the uncoded bit error rate (BER) of the MIMO-OFDM system is studied by considering a two branch transmitter diversity system employing Alamouti space time coding. The selection criterion for the training sequences is proposed by jointly optimizing the MSEE and the BER of the OFDM system. Such sequences, one for each transmitting antenna are required to form an orthogonal set and also ensure a fair distribution of the residual interference due to the training sequence on the data symbols prior to data detection in all the used subcarriers. The effectiveness of the mathematical analysis presented is demonstrated through a comparison with the simulation studies. Also, the proposed scheme is applied to the IEEE 802.16e OFDM standard, its suitability is examined and a case is made with the required design of the sequence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bandwidth efficient channel estimation method using superimposed training for MIMO-OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766451","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766451.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A bandwidth efficient channel estimation method using superimposed training for MIMO-OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766451/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469775","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bandwidth efficient channel estimation method using superimposed training for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050005S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766455,"authors":[{"name":"Dipta Das","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engg, Dr. B.

MSE-OFDM is a bandwidth efficient OFDM scheme, where a number of OFDM symbols are grouped together as a frame and protected by one single cyclic prefix (CP). This improves the bandwidth efficiency and robustness of the system. However, the computational complexity is more in the equalization process in receiver for this system. We propose a multiple access scheme using MSE-OFDM, which uses a new cyclic prefix using pseudo-random (PN) sequences to reduce the computational complexity of the system. The inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the intercarrier interference (ICI) are canceled in the time domain and then frequency domain equalization can be done for each symbol independently. The signals from multiple users are assumed to be synchronous in the downlink and the channel conditions are assumed to be similar for each user.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766479.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiple access scheme using MSE-OFDM with reduced complexity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bandwidth","Computational complexity","Protection","Robustness","Frequency domain analysis","Peak to average power ratio","Intersymbol interference","Redundancy","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","equalisers","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple access scheme","MSE-OFDM","multisymbol encapsulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","computational complexity","cyclic prefix","bandwidth efficiency","pseudorandom sequence","intersymbol interference","intercarrier interference","time domain equalization","frequency domain equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A multiple access scheme using MSE-OFDM with reduced complexity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766479/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459878","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiple access scheme using MSE-OFDM with reduced complexity","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070036S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766488,"authors":[{"name":"Dharmendra Kumar Yadav","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati"],"firstName":"Dharmendra Kumar","lastName":"Yadav","id":"37089144050"},{"name":"Ajay Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati"],"firstName":"Ajay Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"38189058100"},{"name":"Amit Kumar Mishra","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati"],"firstName":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37290432700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2408-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4766488","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766488","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolvers","Image processing","Bandwidth","Convolution","Shift registers","Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Computer buffers","Buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","real-time systems","video signal processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA oriented architecture","field programmable gate array","multiplierless 2-D convolver","buffering scheme","VLSI chip","memory bus bandwidth","real time image processing","video processing"]}],"abstract":"Two dimentional (2-D) convolver is a basic processing unit used in real time video and image processing algorithms.

This paper proposes a new FPGA oriented architecture which uses a multiplierless 2-D convolver with area efficient buffering scheme which achieves high speed and saves up to 80% of chip area at the same time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766488","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766488.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast and area efficient 2-D convolver for real time image processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A fast and area efficient 2-D convolver for real time image processing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4766488/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469800","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766488/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast and area efficient 2-D convolver for real time image processing","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053479S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4766489,"authors":[{"name":"Aniruddha Chandra","affiliation":["E.C.E.

Slow flat small scale statistical fading models, namely Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m and Hoyt fading has been assumed. Moreover, to improve the link quality receiver antenna space diversity is considered where multiple independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) as well as uncorrelated signal replicas are combined before successive demodulation. The proposed linear predetection combiner follows optimum maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm. Obtained error expressions, computed through probability density function (pdf) based approach, consist of finite or, infinite series with fast convergence rate. The series solutions get rid of numerical integration and realize a trade-off between precision and complexity by choosing the number of terms while calculating BER. BER values are plotted against signal to noise ratio (SNR) per bit per channel for each model for different values of diversity order L with varying fading parameters (K, q, and m).","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766489.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER of \u03c0/4-DQPSK with multichannel reception: Some series solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Diversity reception","Fading","AWGN","Rayleigh channels","Signal to noise ratio","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Additive white noise","Rician channels","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","convergence","demodulation","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","probability","quadrature phase shift keying","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential quadrature phase shift keying","bit error rate","BER","multichannel reception","generalized fading channel","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","statistical fading model","link quality receiver antenna space diversity","demodulation","linear predetection combiner","optimum maximal ratio combining","error expression","probability density function","fast convergence rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["\u03c0/4-DQPSK","Rayleigh","Rician","Nakagami-m","Hoyt","MRC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"BER of \u03c0/4-DQPSK with multichannel reception: Some series solutions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766489/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469801","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER of \u03c0/4-DQPSK with multichannel reception: Some series solutions","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056101S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4766493,"authors":[{"name":"Ayan Acharya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Ayan","lastName":"Acharya","id":"37649612900"},{"name":"Aritra Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Aritra","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"38182901300"},{"name":"Koushik Chattopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Koushik","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","id":"38485781900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2408-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4766493","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Lyapunov method","Acceleration","Optimization methods","Equations","Stochastic processes","Evolutionary computation","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov methods","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance improvement","particle swarm optimization algorithm","Lyapunov function modeling","fitness function","convergence speed","positive definite function","multidimensional space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Global Optimization","Particle Swarm Optimization","Lyapunov Function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766493","abstract":"The paper presents a novel concept of improving the convergence speed and solution quality of particle swarm optimization algorithm by Lyapunov modeling of fitness function.

The present work is a medium access control protocol for time division-code division multiple access system to distribute the available bandwidth among the mixture of different traffic classes depending upon their quality of service requirement. The proposed scheme is the combination of packet scheduling algorithm and packet allocation algorithm. The packet scheduling is based on the packet loss probability and total traffic waiting for transmission in the system. It maximizes the fairness of the system. It also maintains the packet loss probability of all the users in the environment within a limit. The packet scheduling algorithm varies the receive power threshold per packet slot dynamically in case the system packet loss probability and/or system average delay crosses a threshold.

The adaptive propagation model was proposed and applied on AIPS. The model provides analysis of the visualized coverage and the received signal strength of the MS (Mobile Station) inside the building by designing the specific location of the transmitter, material of the wall and antenna etc as a construction within building. The performance of this AIPS is investigated by comparing the simulation results with the actual measurements on a location-by-location basis in a building which WCDMA repeaters are operating commercially in KTF, the number 1 WCDMA service provider in Korea. The result shows that the AIPS predicts service coverage on the real access network with a standard deviation of about 5dB over 53 locations in several buildings. The AIPS with the proposed propagation model is widely using to plan the service coverage within a building in KTF WCDMA networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive In-building Propagation Simulator using ray tracing in WCDMA networks","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766533","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766533.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive In-building Propagation Simulator using ray tracing in WCDMA networks","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766533/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469835","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive In-building Propagation Simulator using ray tracing in WCDMA networks","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063003S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4766551,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Yi Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hung-Yi Lin","id":"37087151342"},{"name":"Yen-Tai Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Tai Lai","id":"37087179435"},{"name":"Chi-Chou Kao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Tainan, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Chou Kao","id":"37087168952"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2408-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4766551","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":964},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Operational amplifiers","Feedback circuits","MOSFETs","Dynamic voltage scaling","Negative feedback","Circuit simulation","Differential amplifiers","Voltage control","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","CMOS integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous-time common-mode feedback circuit","fully-differential amplifier","linear common-mode feedback circuit","differential-difference amplifier","MOS transistors","multiply-by-two circuit","TSMC","CMOS process","signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio","voltage 1 V","size 0.35 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766551","abstract":"A linear common-mode feedback (ALCMFB) circuit which combines the modified version of the DDA CMFB with source degeneration using MOS transistors is presented.

Group communication is an essential requirement for MANET since nodes forming these temporary networks generally come together for common purposes and they need to collaborate. Multicast routing protocols plays a significant role in MANET to provide this communication. Multicast transmission allows the operator to drastically save network resources, it also makes the routing of the traffic flows more complex than in unicast transmissions. A huge amount of possible tress have to be considered and analyzed to and the appropriate routing paths. To address this problem, we propose the use of the genetic algorithms, which considerably reduce the number of solutions to be evaluated. Then we select a single path from the set of paths between each node-pair. The routes are computed using the on-demand source routing principle considering the reliability of the nodes. Simulations were conducted on the computed routes to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766559","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766559.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient multicast routing in MANETs: A genetic algorithm approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Mobile ad hoc networks","Mobile communication","Telecommunication network reliability","Collaboration","Multicast protocols","Routing protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Unicast","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","genetic algorithms","mobile radio","multicast protocols","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast routing","genetic algorithm","MANETs:","mobile ad hoc networks","reliable group communication","temporary networks","multicast routing protocols","traffic flows"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile ad hoc networks","multicast routing","Quality-of-Service (QoS)","genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An efficient multicast routing in MANETs: A genetic algorithm approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766559/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10478241","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient multicast routing in MANETs: A genetic algorithm approach","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07025S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766566,"authors":[{"name":"K.

When there are interferences, the FB TMUX system has better performance than orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, as filters which are used in the FB TMUX have better frequency responses than those of the OFDM. The FB TMUX can be efficiently implemented by using cosine modulated filter banks (CMFB). As the CMFB TMUX is obtained from lowpass filters, design of the lowpass filters determines the performance of the CMFB TMUX. Recently the design of CMFB TMUX for unknown channels as been introduced. But in this design roll off factors of the lowpass filters and channel delay compensation factor are not optimized. In this work genetic algorithm (GA) is used for optimizing the roll off factors of the lowpass filters and channel delay compensation factor to improve the signal to interference ratio (SIR) of the CMFB TMUX. Simulation results show that the SIR is considerably improved by using the optimum values of these parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766570","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766570.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of cosine modulated filterbank transmultiplexer for unknown channels using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Filter bank","Genetic algorithms","Intersymbol interference","Channel bank filters","Delay","Discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","Design optimization","Communication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","frequency response","genetic algorithms","interference (signal)","low-pass filters","modulation","transmultiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cosine modulated filterbank transmultiplexer system design","genetic algorithm","multicarrier communication technology","CMFB TMUX system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM system","frequency response","lowpass filter design","channel delay compensation factor","signal-to-interference ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of cosine modulated filterbank transmultiplexer for unknown channels using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766570/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469865","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of cosine modulated filterbank transmultiplexer for unknown channels using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109995S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766571,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

Most existing restoration algorithms are generally inadequate to deal with this problem as they were proposed for restoring noisy blurred images. In this paper, a restoration algorithm based on particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation (WPSO) is proposed to solve the problem. This algorithm makes a good use of the available color palette and the mechanism of a halftoning process to derive useful a priori information for restoration. Simulation results show that it can improve the quality of a half-toned color-quantized image remarkably in terms of both SNRI and convergence rate. The subjective quality of the restored images can also be improved.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766571","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766571.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoration of half-toned color-quantized images using Particle Swarm Optimization with wavelet mutation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Restoration of half-toned color-quantized images using Particle Swarm Optimization with wavelet mutation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10469866","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4766571/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoration of half-toned color-quantized images using Particle Swarm Optimization with wavelet mutation","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047487S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766579,"authors":[{"name":"Leena Vachhani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Leena","lastName":"Vachhani","id":"37570418900"},{"name":"Arun D.

This paper presents the design of a hardware architecture for sensor-based map construction in a planar environment. In particular, the map is a Voronoi diagram of the environment. The Voronoi construction is based on a control law. Features of the proposed architecture are absence of arithmetic operations expensive in digital hardware and a planning algorithm for completing the map. Also, the implementation of control-law uses look-up tables and reuse of CORDIC module to avoid matrix multiplications. A highly area-efficient FPGA implementation of the architecture is also reported.

These two areas of research are important especially when reliable and secure information exchange is required. Steganography is an art of embedding information in a cover image without causing statistically significant variations to the cover image. Steganalysis is the technology that attempts to defeat steganography by detecting the hidden information and extracting. In this paper we propose an image steganography that can verify the reliability of the information being transmitted to the receiver. The method can verify whether the attacker has tried to edit, delete or forge the secret information in the stego-image. The technique embeds the hidden information in the spatial domain of the cover image and uses two special AC coefficients of the discrete wavelet transform domain to verify the veracity (integrity) of the secret information from the stego image. The analysis shows that the BER and PSNR is improved in the case of DWT than DCT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Authentication of secret information in image Steganography","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766581","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766581.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Authentication of secret information in image Steganography","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766581/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469874","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Authentication of secret information in image Steganography","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066727S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766584,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Further, to calculate the 2N - point DFT, by using one N-point DFT involving complex valued data, efficiency is almost doubled.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Read only memory","Frequency","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Fourier transforms","Computational complexity","Fast Fourier transforms","Signal to noise ratio","Difference equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","sequences","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT","2N-point real sequence","DIT FFT","CORDIC based butterflies","ROM","decimation-in-time","discrete Fourier transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766592","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766592","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766592.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766592","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient computation of the DFT of a 2N - point real sequence using FFT with CORDIC based butterflies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient computation of the DFT of a 2N - point real sequence using FFT with CORDIC based butterflies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766592/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766592/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459899","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient computation of the DFT of a 2N - point real sequence using FFT with CORDIC based butterflies","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07281S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4766593,"authors":[{"name":"Amod J.

A time-frequency transform with a variable frequency based on the discrete cosine transform and amplitude modulation is suggested. A method for perfect reconstruction and a way to exploit short-time stationarity of the sources have also been suggested.

SEA effectively eliminates the search points within the search window and thus decreases the number of matching evaluation instances that require very intensive computations compared to the standard full search algorithm (FSA). The proposed architecture for SEA decreases the time to calculate the motion vector by 57 percent compared to FSA. The performance while applying the SEA to several standard video clips has been shown to be same compared to the standard FSA. The proposed architecture uses 16 processing elements accompanied with use of intelligent data arrangement and memory configuration. A technique for reducing external memory accesses has also been developed. The proposed architecture for SEA provides an efficient solution for applications requiring real-time motion estimations. For, it serves to compute motion vectors in less amount of time while requiring almost same power and some increase in area compared to a similar architecture for implementing the full search algorithm. A register-transfer level implementation as well as simulation results on benchmark video clips are presented. Relevant design statistics on area and power for comparing between SEA and FSA implementations are also provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel architecture for successive elimination block matching algorithm","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766628","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766628.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A parallel architecture for successive elimination block matching algorithm","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766628/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10478249","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel architecture for successive elimination block matching algorithm","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085321S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766631,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The key contribution of this paper is to develop synchronization techniques in discrete-time that perform effectively even at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) close to 0 dB in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.

The full resolution image can be restored from the DCT coefficients of the downsampled pixels followed by interpolation scheme at the decoder. The experiments have demonstrated better PSNR improvement over the existing techniques before the critical bit rate.

Channel impulse responses of active users are estimated periodically taking the assistance of pilot blocks. Time variations of channel coefficients between two successive pilot blocks are tracked using Kalman filtering method. Implementation of the Kalman filter in uplink requires the prior knowledge of channel statistics of different multipath channels corresponding to the different active users. In practice, true channel statistics are unknown at receiver, therefore, appropriate assumptions are made regarding the channel statistics in order to determine Kalman parameters. We examine the performance of an uplink MC-CDMA system employing minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and parallel interference canceller - MMSE (PIC-MMSE) MUDs using adaptive channel estimation. It has been found that the proposed method can efficiently track the channel variation up to high fade rates.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766643.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766643","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766643","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766643","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Fading","Statistics","Kalman filters","Bit error rate","Multipath channels","Interference cancellation","Multiuser detection","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","fading channels","Kalman filters","least mean squares methods","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel estimation","uplink MC-CDMA","uplink multicarrier code division multiple access systems","fast fading channels","channel impulse responses","Kalman filtering method","channel statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766643/","displayDocTitle":"Pilot based adaptive channel estimation and tracking in uplink MC-CD MA using Kalman filter","accessionNumber":"10459910","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4766643/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot based adaptive channel estimation and tracking in uplink MC-CD MA using Kalman filter","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046484S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766657,"authors":[{"name":"N.

To implement this proposed scheme the coefficients in the TS-fuzzy rules needs to be optimized. The optimization of this coefficients as well as the coefficient for auxiliary signal generation is performed through particle swarm intelligent algorithm. The performance of the proposed controller is analysed in multimachine power systems subjected to various dynamic and transient disturbances.

The period-3 property is not present outside coding regions, and can be exploited to locate coding regions. For eukaryotes (cells with nucleus) this periodicity has mostly been observed within the exons and not within the introns. Previously binary indicator sequence and electron-ion interaction pseudo potentials (EIIP) indicator sequence has been used for the identification of the coding regions. In this paper we observed that complex indicator sequence provides strong spectral component compared to EIIP indicator sequence. We also observed that windowed DFT taking complex indicator sequence provides better exon prediction compared to windowed DFT taking EIIP indicator sequence and digital filters methods. Computational overhead is reduced by 75% in complex indicator sequence compared to binary indicator sequence. There is maximum discrimination between coding and non-coding regions in complex indicator sequence.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766667","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766667.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP technique for gene and exon prediction taking complex indicator sequence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DSP technique for gene and exon prediction taking complex indicator sequence","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766667/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459915","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4766667/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP technique for gene and exon prediction taking complex indicator sequence","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052118S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-25"},{"_id":4766674,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Tai Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Tai Lai","id":"37277036000"},{"name":"Tzu-Chiang Tai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tzu-Chiang Tai","id":"37971474200"},{"name":"Chung-Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Wei Liu","id":"38190260900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2408-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4766674","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"abstract":"Time-Multiplexed FPGA (TMFPGA) dramatically improves logic utilization by using time-sharing logic.

This is achieved by applying the same clock signal to both the flip-flop and micro register inside control logic block (CLB). They are directly accessible from outside CLB by adding two multiplexers. For execution efficiency, a control signal is added to select the desired reconfiguration memory plane. We also propose a novel two phase circuit partitioning algorithm for this new architecture to minimize the number of stages and balance the area of each stage.

The simulation show promising results proving that adaptive frequency hopping signals can be detected and demodulated in a non cooperative context, even at a very low signal to noise ratio in almost real time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766681/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10469935","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766681/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectral sensing for cognitive radio: Estimation of adaptive frequency hopping signal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral sensing for cognitive radio: Estimation of adaptive frequency hopping signal","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048908S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4766682,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This is designed with the objective of achieving higher speed and wider bandwidth than those already reported in the literature. In the conventional voltage mode sense amplifier, the drains of the input transistors are connected to the sense nodes of the cross coupled inverters. In the proposed voltage mode sense amplifier, the drain of the input transistors are directly connected to the output of cross coupled inverters. This reduces the number of series transistors in the evaluation path and hence it reduces the switching times. Effectiveness of this technique is studied through simulation with Synopsys HSPICE using 180 nm technology models. The results obtained are compared with those obtained using the conventional voltage mode sense amplifier and also with that obtained using current mode sense amplifier. From the simulation results, it is found that the proposed voltage mode sense amplifier has a bandwidth which is twice that of conventional voltage mode sense amplifier. Current mode sense amplifier dissipates about six times more power than the proposed voltage mode sense amplifier to achieve identical bandwidth and delay. The proposed amplifier has a bandwidth of 11.6 GHz and a delay of 20 ps in 0.18 mum technology.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766682","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766682.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wide band voltage mode sense amplifier receiver for high speed interconnects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A wide band voltage mode sense amplifier receiver for high speed interconnects","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766682/","accessionNumber":"10469936","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766682/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wide band voltage mode sense amplifier receiver for high speed interconnects","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070747S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4766711,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Wi-Fi access points have now become very common feature in homes, campuses and public places. In these applications, high-speed, low cost and high security is desirable. Radio frequency (RF) transmission is used in most of the wireless applications. However, the RF spectrum is so congested that it is very difficult to accommodate new high-bit-rate applications. On the other hand, IR technology is less costly, free of government regulation, immune to radio interference, and secure. Infrared radiation (IR) based optical wireless (OW) system with low implementation complexity and no spectrum license requirements can provide a possible solution. This paper proposes architecture of a broadband wireless campus area network (WCAN) using OW links operating at 1550 nm wavelength, which provides eye-safe excellent power budget and improved link performance against ambient light as well as unfavorable weather conditions. The proposed WCAN allows computer users in different buildings e.g. departments, library and studentspsila residences to share multimedia information and resources with fiber-like bandwidth capacity at lower cost. The proposed WCAN is an all-optical network consisting of both indoor as well as outdoor optical links. The indoor optical links provide wireless connectivity to the stationary and mobile wireless data terminals within a room. At the same time, outdoor optical links are the cost effective, high-bandwidth, wireless alternative for inter connecting the various campus entities.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766713","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766713.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture of a broadband wireless campus area network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Architecture of a broadband wireless campus area network","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766713/","accessionNumber":"10469958","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766713/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture of a broadband wireless campus area network","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044456S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4766717,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We also present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm based iterative estimator, valid for any arbitrary constellation, which performs very close to the CRLBs at all SNRs of practical interest and discuss issues regarding this iterative algorithm such as initialization and convergence speed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NDA SNR estimation: CRLBs and EM based estimators","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766719","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766719.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"NDA SNR estimation: CRLBs and EM based estimators","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766719/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469962","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NDA SNR estimation: CRLBs and EM based estimators","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080145S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4766732,"authors":[{"name":"Susmita Das","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Orissa, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Das","id":"37404265900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2408-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4766732","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1363},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766732","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Wireless communication","Antenna arrays","Wireless networks","Interchannel interference","Mobile antennas","Antenna accessories","Base stations","Directive antennas","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","adaptive antenna arrays","adaptive signal processing","array signal processing","cellular radio","cochannel interference","interference suppression","mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart antenna design","wireless communication","adaptive beam-forming approach","3G wireless network","cochannel interference reduction","multipath interference","software-based technique","mobile station","cellular communications system","blind adaptive algorithm","learning characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna Arrays","Adaptive Algorithms","Beamforming","Interference","Smart antenna","Signal Nulling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766732","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766732.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart antenna design for wireless communication using adaptive beam-forming approach","abstract":"Smart antenna is recognized as promising technologies for higher user capacity in 3G wireless networks by effectively reducing multipath and co-channel interference. Advent of powerful, low-cost, digital processing components and the development of software-based techniques has made smart antenna systems a practical reality for both base station and mobile station of a cellular communications systems in the next generation. The core of smart antenna is the selection of smart algorithms in adaptive array. Using beam forming algorithms the weight of antenna arrays can be adjusted to form certain amount of adaptive beam to track corresponding users automatically and at the same time to minimize interference arising from other users by introducing nulls in their directions. Thus interferences can be suppressed and the desired signals can be extracted. This research work provides description, comparative analysis and utility of various reference signal based algorithms as well as blind adaptive algorithms. Exhaustive simulation study of beam patterns and learning characteristics have proved the efficacies of the proposed work from application point of view.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766732/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10459925","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766732/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Smart antenna design for wireless communication using adaptive beam-forming approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart antenna design for wireless communication using adaptive beam-forming approach","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046915S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4766736,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Thus method does not consider the structural information of the input images in the feature space. Therefore, the computed principal components have less discriminating power. In this paper, a new kernel PCA, referred to as the direct kernel PCA (DKPCA), is proposed for face recognition, which explicitly maps an input image nonlinearly into a feature space and then computes the principal components directly in the mapped space. Therefore, this method considers the structural information of the input images in the feature space for computation of principal components, leading to have higher discriminating power. We have designed RBF neural networks for classification of input images based on the computed principal components. The proposed method is evaluated on the ORL database. The results indicate that the proposed method is able to achieve excellent performance and outperforms some of the reported methods using the conventional kernel PCA.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766736","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766736.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct kernel PCA with RBF neural networks for face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Principal component analysis","Neural networks","Face recognition","Feature extraction","Pixel","Space technology","Computer networks","Computer science","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","principal component analysis","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct kernel PCA","RBF neural networks","face recognition","input images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Direct kernel PCA with RBF neural networks for face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766736/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469971","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct kernel PCA with RBF neural networks for face recognition","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087004S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766746,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In MLs segmentation technique, the search operation is pipelined by breaking the match-lines into two segments. If the stored words are not matched with the search data in their first segment, then the searching operation is discontinued for the second segment, thus reducing power. In non-segmented MLs technique, the search operation is not pipelined and is carried out for complete data word in TCAM.

This paper explores the possibility of reduction in the energy dissipation in 6T-SRAM cell. This paper evaluates SRAM cell with and without introducing stacking in nanometer regime. Overall leakage in a stack of transistors reduces due to modification of gate to source voltage, threshold voltage and drain induced barrier lowering. T-spice and L-Edit simulation results shows that compared to the conventional high performance SRAM cells, stacked cells offer significant reduction of power consumption.

DS-CDMA is a popular multiple-access technology for wireless communication. However its performance is limited by multiple-access interference (MAI) and multipath distortion. Adaptive techniques for detection of DS-CDMA signals improves the performance of the CDMA system by reducing interference among users by employing two major types of adaptive technique called least mean squares (LMS) and recursive least square (RLS) in non-dispersive channels.

Simulations have proved its better performance compared with the conventional Match Filter detector, performing nearly as well as single user case.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of MMSE based adaptive multiuser detection of DS-CDMA signals in dispersive and non-dispersive channels","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766759","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766759.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of MMSE based adaptive multiuser detection of DS-CDMA signals in dispersive and non-dispersive channels","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766759/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469989","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of MMSE based adaptive multiuser detection of DS-CDMA signals in dispersive and non-dispersive channels","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045977S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766767,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We have referred to the proposed algorithm as delayed block least mean square (DBLMS) algorithm. Unlike the delayed least mean square (DLMS) algorithm, the DBLMS algorithm takes a block of L input samples and yields a block of L output in every training cycle. The simulation result shows that the DBLMS algorithm has convergence performance equivalent to that of the DLMS algorithm. We have exploited the parallelism inherent in the DBLMS algorithm to derive a highly concurrent systolic architecture for FIR adaptive filters. The proposed architecture can support L time higher sampling rate compared with the best of the existing pipelined designs and, therefore, it would involve less samples of adaptation delays and would provide a more efficient implementation of LMS-based adaptive filters.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766786","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766786.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delayed block LMS algorithm and concurrent architecture for high-speed implementation of adaptive FIR filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delayed block LMS algorithm and concurrent architecture for high-speed implementation of adaptive FIR filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766786/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470009","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4766786/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delayed block LMS algorithm and concurrent architecture for high-speed implementation of adaptive FIR filters","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041388S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766790,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Bhattacharyya","affiliation":["E & ECE Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Bhattacharyya","id":"37824636000"},{"name":"Swapna Banerjee","affiliation":["E & ECE Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Swapna","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37276973900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2408-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4766790","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of two N-point IDCT s via a single N-point IFFT using radix-4 algorithm & its proposed architecture","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of the evaluation of inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) using existing radix-2 IFFT algorithm applicable for image and signal processing where a huge number of data points are required for a particular operation. Since radix-4 architecture has fewer multiplications than radix-2, then it is judicial to carry out the IDCT operation via radix-4 IFFT for a huge savings of number of computations for the data points which are power of four. In this paper the authors have modified the existing IDCT-DFT algorithm to allow the computation of two concurrent N Point IDCT s via a single N point radix-4 IFFT instead of using radix-2 IFFT. As a result the total amount of arithmetic workload is greatly reduced. A supporting architecture which can be applicable for real time operation is also suggested to realize a 16 point IDCT algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766790","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766790.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Signal processing algorithms","Discrete cosine transforms","Signal processing","Image processing","Indexing","Pipeline processing","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","fast Fourier transforms","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["N-point IDCT","single N-point IFFT","radix-4 algorithm","inverse discrete cosine transform","signal processing","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CORDIC","IDCT","IFFT","Proposed Archi-tecture","radix-4","real data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Computation of two N-point IDCT s via a single N-point IFFT using radix-4 algorithm & its proposed architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766790/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766790/","accessionNumber":"10470013","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of two N-point IDCT s via a single N-point IFFT using radix-4 algorithm & its proposed architecture","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075809S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4766793,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In the next step, KWS system is also developed by combining HMM and VQ (HMM-VQ) and also HMM and VOP (HMM-VOP) based KWS systems. The performance measured in terms of Figure Of Merit (FOM) for HMM, VQ and VOP are 53.32, 22.41 and 26.95, respectively. The FOM of combinations HMM-VQ and HMM-VOP are 57.18 and 60.62, respectively.

Method of Least Squares (LS) is a popular technique for performing channel estimation. The LS Estimation method requires the channel to be constant through out the estimation period. In reality, the wireless channel is time varying and we will always get an estimation error when we estimate the channel with block techniques like the LS Estimation. Moreover, the channel is affected by noise and this will also add some error in estimation. MIMO system, which offers gain in capacity, is an area of recent interest. Analysis of LS estimation error for SISO Rayleigh channel is available in literature. Approximate analytical expressions for the variance of the error for a Rician fading channel for a MIMO system is presented here. The validity of the expression has been checked through computer simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766811.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the LS estimation error for a MIMO system on a Rician fading channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation error","MIMO","Rician channels","Rayleigh channels","Channel estimation","Error analysis","Transmitters","Least squares approximation","Transmitting antennas","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel estimation","error statistics","least squares approximations","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","Rician fading channel","least square estimation error","coherent detection technique","wireless channel estimation","block technique","channel capacity","SISO Rayleigh channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rician fading","Estimation error","Least squares","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the LS estimation error for a MIMO system on a Rician fading channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766811/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470026","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the LS estimation error for a MIMO system on a Rician fading channel","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043357S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766829,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjib Mishra","affiliation":["N.I.T.

In this paper, a new methodology for slip detection during grasping by robot grippers/end-effectors using tactile sensor has been presented. During the object slippage, the tactile sensor in touch with the object surface travels along the peaks and valleys of surface texture of the object which creates vibratory motions in the tactile. A newly developed mathematical model is used to compute the scattered energy of vibrations, which contains parameters of surface texture geometry as well as trial grasping force, and other relevant parameters. Using the scattered energy of vibrations predicted by soft computing techniques, an attempt to instantly estimate the adequate grasping force has been reasonably successful. Surface texture data, for experimental estimation of grasping force, were collected from a huge number of machined specimens and were used to build four different machine learning estimation techniques. Experimental results using Linear Regression (LR), Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Pace Regression (PR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) demonstrate a relatively better technique for industrial applications.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766846","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766846.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grasping force estimation detecting slip by tactile sensor adopting machine learning techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766846/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Grasping force estimation detecting slip by tactile sensor adopting machine learning techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766846/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10459951","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grasping force estimation detecting slip by tactile sensor adopting machine learning techniques","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056731S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4766849,"authors":[{"name":"S.

One of the novelties of the proposed approach is the judicious combination of two methods so as to reduce the bandwidth overhead and computational complexity without compromising the CFO estimation range. Unlike many of the existing techniques, the proposed CFO estimator does not require MIMO channel estimates as a prerequisite, that are difficult to obtain in practise. It employs the cyclic prefix and a few null subcarriers respectively for the fractional and integer frequency offset estimations. We also propose a novel null subcarrier allocation scheme based on Fibonacci series. The range of frequency offset that can be estimated by the proposed technique is equal to the full OFDM bandwidth. Furthermore, performance of the proposed frequency offset estimator is mathematically analyzed by deriving the Cramer-Rao lower bound and compared it with the mean square estimation error to demonstrate its efficiency. It has been shown that our approach greatly outperform a recently published method in terms of BER performance and computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766849","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766849.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient maximum likelihood CFO estimation scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766849/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient maximum likelihood CFO estimation scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470052","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766849/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient maximum likelihood CFO estimation scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089778S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766861,"authors":[{"name":"Deepyaman Maiti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Deepyaman","lastName":"Maiti","id":"37659512400"},{"name":"R Janarthanan","affiliation":["Department of IT, Jaya Engineering College, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Janarthanan","id":"37661652900"},{"name":"Amit Konar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Konar","id":"37299656200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2408-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2409-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4766861","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Particle swarm optimization","System identification","Least squares approximation","Control systems","Batteries","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Fractional calculus","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","particle swarm optimisation","reduced order systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter identification","fractional order dynamical system","particle swarm optimization","system identification","process parameter estimation","control theory","parameter varying system","integral order model","fractional order process","fitness function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766861","abstract":"This contribution deals with identification of fractional-order dynamical systems. System identification, which refers to estimation of process parameters, is a necessity in control theory. Accurate estimation is particularly important for systems having varying parameters, which is the usual case with physical processes. Real processes are usually of fractional order as opposed to the ideal integral order models. A simple and elegant scheme of estimating the parameters for such a fractional order process is proposed in this paper. A population of process models is generated and updated by PSO technique, the fitness function being the sum of squared deviations from the actual set of observations. Results show that the proposed scheme offers a high degree of accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766861","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766861.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter identification of a fractional order dynamical system using particle swarm optimization technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766861/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parameter identification of a fractional order dynamical system using particle swarm optimization technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766861/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10459958","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter identification of a fractional order dynamical system using particle swarm optimization technique","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061691S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4766864,"authors":[{"name":"M Subadra","affiliation":["TRA Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, A.

Researchers have proved that diagnosis of microbial infections can be improved by E-sniffer technology which consists of Artificial Neural Network as pattern recognizer. As on date the neural network implementations are in software, hence such technology suffers from portability, manipulation and high cost. With the appearance of large, dense, highly parallel Field Programmable Gate Array circuits, it has now become possible to realize large-scale neural networks in hardware, with the flexibility and low cost of software implementations. This paper aims at developing the Artificial Neural Network as neuro chip so that portable medical diagnostic E-sniffer for E.Coli identification can be prototyped. The Multilayer perceptron with 12 input neurons, one hidden layer with 8 neurons and 3 output neurons are made hardware realizable in Altera cyclone II DE2 board with NIOSII processor and the EP2C35F672C6 as target device. The functional simulation is done using Modelsim 8.5C and cross compared with the software solutions obtained using Nerosolution4.2. After implementation the circuit is verified for its functionality and timing. The performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity for this implementation are highly satisfactory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuro-chip design for developing wearable medical diagnostic E-sniffer","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766864","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2008 - 2008 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753725/4766377/04766864.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2008.4766864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Neuro-chip design for developing wearable medical diagnostic E-sniffer","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4766864/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470060","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuro-chip design for developing wearable medical diagnostic E-sniffer","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069028S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753725","isNumber":"4766377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4766377","articleId":"4766864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4766876,"authors":[{"name":"Larry S.

For finite-length data, these transforms provide different approximations to the KL transform of the said data. From the theory of these transforms some well-known facts about orthogonal transforms are easily explained and some widely misunderstood concepts are brought to light. For example, the near-optimal behavior of the even discrete cosine transform to the KL transform of first-order Markov processes is explained and, at the same time, it is shown that this transform is not always such a good (or near-optimal) approximation to the above-mentioned KL transform. It is also shown that each member of the sinusoidal family is the KL transform of a unique, first-order, non-stationary (in general), Markov process. Asymptotic equivalence and other interesting properties of these transforms can be studied by analyzing the underlying Markov processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 1979","pubMedId":"21868870","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","volume":"PAMI-1","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"A Sinusoidal Family of Unitary Transforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sinusoidal Family of Unitary Transforms","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-1-n4-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04696S","chronDate":"Oct.  1979","isNumber":"4766937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"213","articleId":"4766944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4766945,"authors":[{"name":"Yechiam Yemini","affiliation":["Information Science Institute, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA","School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yechiam","lastName":"Yemini","id":"37332368600"},{"name":"Judea Pearl","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Judea","lastName":"Pearl","id":"37325553600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4766945","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete transforms","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Decorrelation","Fourier transforms","Signal processing","Statistics","Covariance matrix","Degradation","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete cosine transform","discrete Fourier transform","signal processing","unitary transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766945","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1979.4766945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","abstract":"A method for studying the asymptotic behavior of discrete transformations is developed using numerical quadrature theory.

In this paper we point out that if the blob boundary is modeled as a Markov process and the additive noise is modeled as a white Gaussian noise field, then maximization of the joint likelihood of the hypothesized blob boundary and all of the image data results in roughly the same blob boundary determination as does one of the aforementioned deterministic formulations [2]. However, the formulation in this paper provides insights into and optimal parameter values for the functions involved and reveals suboptimalities in some of the formulations appearing in the literature. More generally, we agree that maximization of the joint likelihood of the hypothesized blob boundary and of the entire picture function is a fundamental approach to boundary estimation or the estimation of linear features (roads, rivers, etc.) in images, and provides a powerful mechanism for designing sequential, parallel, or other boundary estimation algorithms. The ripple filter, an advanced form of region growing, is briefly introduced and illustrates one of a number of alternative algorithms for maximizing the likelihood function. Hence, this likelihood maximization approach provides a unified view for seemingly different approaches, such as sequential boundary finding and region growing. Bounds on the accuracy of boundary estimation are readily derived with this formulation and are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1979.4766946","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4766937/04766946.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"384","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1979.4766946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Markov-Process Blob Boundaries in Noisy Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Markov-Process Blob Boundaries in Noisy Images","volume":"PAMI-1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"21868872","publicationDate":"Oct. 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Markov-Process Blob Boundaries in Noisy Images","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-1-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032754S","chronDate":"Oct.  1979","isNumber":"4766937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"36","articleId":"4766946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4766947,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Philip","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Philip","id":"37987183600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4766947","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"We consider the convolution equation f * h + e = d, where f is sought, h is a known ``point spread function,'' e represents random errors, and d is the measured data.

Its original idea comes from a sequence of terminal symbols of a context-free grammar. It is a promising technique of data compression for ordinary binary-valued pictures such as texts, documents, charts, etc. Fundamental notions like complexity, primitives, simplifications, and other items about binary-valued pictures are introduced at the beginning. A simple context-free grammar G is also introduced. It is shown that every binary-valued picture is interpretable as a terminal sequence of that G. The DF-expression is defined as the reduced terminal sequence of G. It represents the original picture in every detail and contains no surplus data for reproducing it. A quantitative discussion about the total data of a DF-expression leads to the conclusion that any binary-valued picture with complexity less than 0.47 is expressed by the DF-expression with fewer data than the original ones. The coding algorithm of original data into the DF-expression is developed. It is very simple and recursively executable. Experiments were carried out using a PDS (photo digitizing system), where test pictures were texts, charts, diagrams, etc. with 20 cm \u00d7 20 cm size. Data compression techniques in facsimile were also simulated on the same test pictures. Throughout these studies it was made clear that the DF-expression is a very effective technique as a data compression for binary pictorial patterns not only because it yields high data compression but also because its coding and decoding algorithms are very feasible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1980","volume":"PAMI-2","issue":"1","pubMedId":"22499620","publicationDate":"Jan. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On a Method of Binary-Picture Representation and Its Application to Data Compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On a Method of Binary-Picture Representation and Its Application to Data Compression","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-2-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024403S","chronDate":"Jan.  1980","isNumber":"4766960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"101","articleId":"4766967","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4766969,"authors":[{"name":"Alton L.

New high-speed algorithms together with fast digital hardware have produced a system for missile and aircraft identification and tracking that possesses a degree of ``intelligence'' not previously implemented in a real-time tracking system. Adaptive statistical clustering and projection-based classification algorithms are applied in real time to identify and track objects that change in appearance through complex and nonstationary background/foreground situations. Fast estimation and prediction algorithms combine linear and quadratic estimators to provide speed and sensitivity. Weights are determined to provide a measure of confidence in the data and resulting decisions. Strategies based on maximizing the probability of maintaining track are developed. This paper emphasizes the theoretical aspects of the system and discusses the techniques used to achieve real-time implementation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4766969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4766960/04766969.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"56","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4766969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Real-Time Video Tracking System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1980","displayDocTitle":"A Real-Time Video Tracking System","volume":"PAMI-2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"22499622","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Real-Time Video Tracking System","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-2-n1-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03589S","chronDate":"Jan.  1980","isNumber":"4766960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"76","articleId":"4766969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4766975,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Automatic verification of the quality of printed wiring boards (PWB's) using pattern recognition techniques is one potential application in this field. Qualitatively, this problem is finding small, irregular features in an environment of complicated, but larger and well-defined geometric features. In addition to the basic pattern recognition task, stringent performance requirements, both for throughput and accuracy, must be met if actual production usage is expected. The method employed in this study is based on characterizing 5 \u00d7 5 or 7 \u00d7 7 element binary patterns derived from the class of PWB's being inspected as good or defective. A database of 80 512 \u00d7 512 element images of PWB's was constructed and used to determine the number of unique patterns and their rates of occurrence. The major experimental result of this study is that less than 500 of the possible (15/16)224 5 \u00d7 5 patterns are needed to describe all the border containing patterns in the 80 images. It is also apparent that more patterns would be required if the training database was larger. The small number of patterns needed to represent virtually all of the normal border patterns suggests a two-stage inspection strategy. In the first stage, each border pattern from the PWB being inspected is compared to a previously prepared list.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4766975","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4766960/04766975.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4766975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Automating the Visual Inspection of Printed Wiring Boards","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Wiring","Conductors","Pattern recognition","Conducting materials","Manufacturing processes","Throughput","Production","Image databases","Flexible manufacturing systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automated inspection","pattern recognition","printed wiring boards"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766975/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1980","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Automating the Visual Inspection of Printed Wiring Boards","volume":"PAMI-2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"22499628","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Automating the Visual Inspection of Printed Wiring Boards","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-2-n1-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024157S","chronDate":"Jan.  1980","isNumber":"4766960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4766975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4766988,"authors":[{"name":"Jack Sklansky","affiliation":["SENIOR MEMBER, IEEE, Departments of Electrical Engineering, Information and Computer Science and Radiological Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717."],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Sklansky","id":"37300272400"},{"name":"Leo Michelotti","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Division, Hughes Aircraft Company, Irvine, CA 92715."],"firstName":"Leo","lastName":"Michelotti","id":"37088268251"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4766988","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":238},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Piecewise linear techniques","Error analysis","Piecewise linear approximation","Logic","Clustering algorithms","Pattern recognition","Prototypes","Low earth orbit satellites","Algorithm design and analysis","Vectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayes decision surface","classifier","cluster analysis","minimum logic","pattern recognition","prototypes","switching theory","window training procedure"]}],"abstract":"We describe a versatile technique for designing computer algorithms for separating multiple-dimensional data (feature vectors) into two classes.

Our design procedure finds a set of close-opposed pairs of clusters of data. From these pairs the procedure generates a piecewise-linear approximation of the Bayes-optimum decision surface. A window training procedure on each linear segment of the approximation provides great flexibility of design over a wide range of class densities. The data consumed in the training of each segment are restricted to just those data lying near that segment, which makes possible the construction of efficient data bases for the training process. Interactive simplification of the classifier is facilitated by an adjacency matrix and an incidence matrix. The adjacency matrix describes the interrelationships of the linear segments {\u00a3i}. The incidence matrix describes the interrelationships among the polyhedrons formed by the hyperplanes containing {\u00a3i}.

The interrelationships are two ternary relations on the primitives: the intrusion relation which relates two simple parts that join to the intrusion they surround and the protrusion relation which relates two intrusions to the protrusion between them. Using this model, a shape matching procedure that uses a tree search with look-ahead to find mappings from a prototype shape to a candidate shape has been developed.

The use of three-dimensional moment invariants is proposed as a solution. The generalization of the results of two-dimensional moment invariants which had linked two-dimensional moments to binary quantics is done by linking three-dimensional moments to ternary quantics. The existence and number of nth order moments in two and three dimensions is explored. Algebraic invariants of several ternary forms under different orthogonal transformations are derived by using the invariant property of coefficients of ternary forms. The result is a set of three-dimensional moment invariants which are invariant under size, orientation, and position change. This property is highly significant in compressing the data which are needed in three-dimensional object recognition. Empirical examples are also given.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4766990","startPage":"127","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4766983/04766990.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4766990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4766983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Moment Invariants","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Object recognition","Missiles","Power generation","Joining processes","Image coding","Image processing","Pattern recognition","Character recognition","Layout"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algebraic invariants","binary quantics","cogradient sets","contragradient sets","eccentricity of quadratics","image processing","invariant features","moment invariants","moment generating functions","object recognition","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4766990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1980","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Moment Invariants","volume":"PAMI-2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1980","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"21868883","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Moment Invariants","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-2-n2-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04689S","chronDate":"March  1980","isNumber":"4766983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"249","articleId":"4766990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4766994,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Sen Lee","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Jong-Sen","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280313000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4766994","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1597,"citationCountPatent":41,"totalDownloads":9115},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital images","Digital filters","Statistics","Signal processing algorithms","Filtering algorithms","Additive noise","Image processing","Pixel","Image enhancement","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital image enhancement","local statistics","noise filtering","real-time processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4766994","abstract":"Computational techniques involving contrast enhancement and noise filtering on two-dimensional image arrays are developed based on their local mean and variance. These algorithms are nonrecursive and do not require the use of any kind of transform. They share the same characteristics in that each pixel is processed independently. Consequently, this approach has an obvious advantage when used in real-time digital image processing applications and where a parallel processor can be used. For both the additive and multiplicative cases, the a priori mean and variance of each pixel is derived from its local mean and variance. Then, the minimum mean-square error estimator in its simplest form is applied to obtain the noise filtering algorithms. For multiplicative noise a statistical optimal linear approximation is made. Experimental results show that such an assumption yields a very effective filtering algorithm. Examples on images containing 256 \u00d7 256 pixels are given.

The algorithms which will be examined are the spatial gray level dependence method (SGLDM), the gray level run length method (GLRLM), the gray level difference method (GLDM), and the power spectral method (PSM). The evaluation procedure employed does not depend on the set of features used with each algorithm or the pattern recognition scheme. Rather, what is examined is the amount of texturecontext information contained in the spatial gray level dependence matrices, the gray level run length matrices, the gray level difference density functions, and the power spectrum. The comparison will be performed in two steps. First, only Markov generated textures will be considered. The Markov textures employed are similar to the ones used by perceptual psychologist B. Julesz in his investigations of human texture perception. These Markov textures provide a convenient mechanism for generating certain example texture pairs which are important in the analysis process. In the second part of the analysis the results obtained by considering only Markov textures will be extended to all textures which can be represented by translation stationary random fields of order two. This generalization clearly includes a much broader class of textures than Markovian ones. The results obtained indicate that the SGLDM is the most powerful algorithm of the four considered, and that the GLDM is more powerful than the PSM.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767003/04767008.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4767008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4767008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theoretical Comparison of Texture Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cyclic redundancy check","Algorithm design and analysis","Image texture analysis","Performance analysis","Performance evaluation","Pattern recognition","Density functional theory","Psychology","Humans","Image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Comparison study","image processing","texture analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1980","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical Comparison of Texture Algorithms","volume":"PAMI-2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1980","pubMedId":"21868894","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical Comparison of Texture Algorithms","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-2-n3-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047403S","chronDate":"May  1980","isNumber":"4767003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"562","articleId":"4767008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4767009,"authors":[{"name":"Kameswara Rao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Linkoping, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kameswara","lastName":"Rao","id":"38187927500"},{"name":"Kenneth Balck","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Linkoping, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Balck","id":"38054556900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767009","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Sampling methods","Matrix converters","Smoothing methods","Pattern recognition","Bifurcation","Image processing","TV","Cameras","Skin"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","fingerprint","patterns","programmed grammar","recognition","sampling matrix","smoothing","syntactic approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767009","abstract":"A fingerprint classification procedure using a computer is described.

The concepts of homogeneity and of separation can be made precise when a measure of dissimilarity between the entities is given. Let us define the diameter of a partition of the given set of entities into clusters as the maximum dissimilarity between any pair of entities in the same cluster and the split of a partition as the minimum dissimilarity between entities in different clusters. The problems of determining a partition into a given number of clusters with minimum diameter (i.e., a partition of maximum homogeneity) or with maximum split (i.e., a partition of maximum separation) are first considered. It is shown that the latter problem can be solved by the classical single-link clustering algorithm, while the former can be solved by a graph-theoretic algorithm involving the optimal coloration of a sequence of partial graphs, described in more detail in a previous paper. A partition into a given number of clusters will be called efficient if and only if there exists no partition into at most the same number of clusters with smaller diameter and not smaller split or with larger split and not larger diameter. Two efficient partitions are called equivalent if and only if they have the same values for the split and for the diameter.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4767027","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767023/04767027.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"291","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4767027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bicriterion Cluster Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","displayDocTitle":"Bicriterion Cluster Analysis","volume":"PAMI-2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"21868904","publicationDate":"July 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bicriterion Cluster Analysis","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-2-n4-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030034S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"4767023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"73","articleId":"4767027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767029,"authors":[{"name":"Theodosios Pavlidis","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Theodosios","lastName":"Pavlidis","id":"37320092900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767029","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":241,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":747},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767029","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Pattern recognition","Shape measurement","Area measurement","Fourier transforms","Computational complexity","Fourier series","Integral equations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chain codes","corner detection","curvature","decomposition techniques","Fourier shape descriptors","shape analysis","syntactic analysis"]}],"abstract":"Algorithms for shape analysis are reviewed and classified under various criteria, whether they examine the boundary only or the whole area and whether they describe the original picture in terms of scalar measurements or through structural descriptions.

Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image. These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4767032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767023/04767032.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1980.4767032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767023","startPage":"333","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disparity Analysis of Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Disparity Analysis of Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1980","pubMedId":"21868909","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disparity Analysis of Images","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-2-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072299S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"4767023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"544","articleId":"4767032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767034,"authors":[{"name":"Ryszard S.

The paper formulates the theoretical framework and a method for inferring general and optimal (according to certain criteria) descriptions of object classes from examples of classification or partial descriptions. The language for expressing the class descriptions and the guidance rules is an extension of the first-order predicate calculus, called variable-valued logic calculus VL21. VL21 involves typed variables and contains several new operators especially suited for conducting inductive inference, such as selector, internal disjunction, internal conjunction, exception, and generalization. Important aspects of the theory include: 1) a formulation of several kinds of generalization rules; 2) an ability to uniformly and adequately handle descriptors (i.e., variables, functions, and predicates) of different type (nominal, linear, and structured) and of different arity (i.e., different number of arguments); 3) an ability to generate new descriptors, which are derived from the initial descriptors through a rule-based system (i.e., an ability to conduct the so called constructive induction); 4) an ability to use the semantics underlying the problem under consideration. An experimental computer implementation of the method is briefly described and illustrated by an example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1980","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"July 1980","pubMedId":"21868911","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-2","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pattern Recognition as Rule-Guided Inductive Inference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern Recognition as Rule-Guided Inductive Inference","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-2-n4-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029195S","chronDate":"July  1980","isNumber":"4767023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"285","articleId":"4767034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767035,"authors":[{"name":"Shmuel Peleg","affiliation":["Computer Science Center, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Shmuel","lastName":"Peleg","id":"37281885400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767035","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":140,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":227},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random variables","Probability distribution","Labeling","Image segmentation","Text processing","Handwriting recognition","Distributed computing","Computer science"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image processing","line enhancement","relaxation","segmentation"]}],"abstract":"Let a vector of probabilities be associated with every node of a graph.

Less-constrained systems will need to compensate for their loss of top-down constraint by improving bottom-up performance. To do this, they will need to eliminate from consideration at each place in the utterance most words in their vocabularies solely on the basis of acoustic information and expected pronunciations of the words. Towards this goal, we present the design and performance of Noah, a bottom-up word hypothesizer which is capable of handling large vocabularies-more than 10 000 words. Noah takes (machine) segmented and labeled speech as input and produces word hypotheses. The primary concern of this work is the problem of word hypothesizing from large vocabularies. Particular attention has been paid to accuracy, knowledge representation, knowledge acquisition, and flexibility. In this paper we discuss the problem of word hypothesizing, describe how the design of Noah faces these problems, and present the performance of Noah as a function of the vocabulary size.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767041/04767049.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noah-A Bottom-Up Word Hypothesizer for Large-Vocabulary Speech Understanding Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vocabulary","Loudspeakers","Speech recognition","Costs","Performance loss","Knowledge representation","Knowledge acquisition","Monitoring","Helium","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large vocabularies","speech understanding","hypothesizing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Noah-A Bottom-Up Word Hypothesizer for Large-Vocabulary Speech Understanding Systems","volume":"PAMI-3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noah-A Bottom-Up Word Hypothesizer for Large-Vocabulary Speech Understanding Systems","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-3-n1-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045314S","chronDate":"Jan.  1981","isNumber":"4767041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4767049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767076,"authors":[{"name":"Stanley R.

This paper proposes a new paradigm for a modular computer vision system which is both data directed and knowledge based. The system consists of three different types of units, two of which are associative data memories implemented as relational databases. The short-term memory (STM) contains the raw color picture data and the most current interpretations and deductions about the original scene. The long-term memory (LTM) contains a detailed model of the scene under consideration. A collection of analysis processors, each of which is specialized for a particular task, can communicate with both of these memories. The information in the LTM remains unchanged during the analysis, while the STM is being continually updated and revised by the appropriate processors. The latter may be conceived of as being activated by certain data conditions in the STM, and using the information in both the LTM and STM to alter the status of the STM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modular Computer Vision System for Picture Segmentation and Interpretation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767147","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767139/04767147.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1981","displayDocTitle":"A Modular Computer Vision System for Picture Segmentation and Interpretation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-3","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 1981","pubMedId":"21868974","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modular Computer Vision System for Picture Segmentation and Interpretation","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-3-n5-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045146S","chronDate":"Sept.  1981","isNumber":"4767139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"71","articleId":"4767147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":4767153,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The fixed vectors are sometimes called characteristic feature vectors, codewords, cluster centers, models, reproductions, etc. The nearest neighbor rule considered uses a non-Euclidean information-theoretic distortion measure that is not a metric, but that nevertheless leads to a classification method that is optimal in a well-defined sense and is also computationally attractive. Furthermore, the distortion measure results in a simple method of computing cluster centroids. Our approach is based on the minimization of cross-entropy (also called discrimination information, directed divergence, K-L number), and can be viewed as a refinement of a general classification method due to Kullback. The refinement exploits special properties of cross-entropy that hold when the probability densities involved happen to be minimum cross-entropy densities. The approach is a generalization of a recently developed speech coding technique called speech coding by vector quantization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Cross-Entropy Pattern Classification and Cluster Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767189","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767183/04767189.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Cross-Entropy Pattern Classification and Cluster Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-4","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 1982","pubMedId":"21868997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Cross-Entropy Pattern Classification and Cluster Analysis","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-4-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116028S","chronDate":"Jan.  1982","isNumber":"4767183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"80","articleId":"4767189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4767215,"authors":[{"name":"Richard E.

Level crossings have received increased attention as features for pattern recognition because of their capability to provide information related to both amplitude and frequency behavior. A detailed analysis of the average rate of change of band-limited functions is presented, including a derivation of the least upper bound on functions for which the zeroth absolute moments of the functions are bounded. The average rate of change of a function over an interval in which one endpoint of the interval is an extremum of the function is similarly bounded and used to establish a sampling rate which guarantees that between successive samples of a band-limited function with bounded zeroth absolute moment the function itself does not deviate from the amplitude interval defined by the samples by more than some predefined amplitude change. Based on these results, a theorem is developed which defines the sampling rate required to ensure that, in the estimation of level crossing profiles, no more than 2m (m >> 1) level crossings of m levels are missed per extremum of the sampled function. It is shown that the sampling rate defined by this theorem reduces to the well-known Nyquist rate for the special case of zero crossing analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Pattern recognition","Signal analysis","Upper bound","Signal processing","Fluctuations","Amplitude estimation","Frequency measurement","Particle measurements","Time measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude variations","features","level crossings","multilevel","pattern recognition","sampling","signal","zero crossings"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767208/04767215.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Considerations for Multilevel Crossing Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Considerations for Multilevel Crossing Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767215/","volume":"PAMI-4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1982","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"21869014","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Considerations for Multilevel Crossing Analysis","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-4-n2-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026059S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"4767208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4767215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4767216,"authors":[{"name":"James A.

In this method the autoregressive parameters associated with an ARMA model consisting of q zeros and p poles are optimally chosen with the selection being based on a finite set of time series observations. This selection is made so that a set of Yule-Walker equation approximations are ``best'' satisfied. The resultant autoregressive parameter estimates have the desired statistical feature of being unbiased and consistent. This estimation method has been found to provide a modeling performance which typically equals or exceeds that of contemporary alternatives. Moreover, this method is amenable to a computationally efficient adaptive solution procedure. The autoregressive parameters characterizing the resultant ARMA model estimate can serve the role of decision variables in pattern classification schemes. For example, these parameters can be utilized in determining whether or not a member(s) of a given signal class is contained within a noise corrupted measurement signal. This approach has been found to be particularly effective in Doppler radar and array processing applications in which one is looking for the presence of spectral lines (i.e., sinusoids) in the measurement signal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767208/04767216.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARMA Modeling of Time Series","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Array signal processing","Entropy","Iterative methods","Maximum likelihood estimation","Poles and zeros","Parameter estimation","Pattern classification","Noise measurement","Doppler radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ARMA models","feature extraction","spectral analysis","time series models","Yule-Walker equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","displayDocTitle":"ARMA Modeling of Time Series","volume":"PAMI-4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1982","pubMedId":"21869015","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARMA Modeling of Time Series","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-4-n2-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027926S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"4767208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4767216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4767220,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Francois Abramatic","affiliation":["Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique, Le Chesnay, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Francois","lastName":"Abramatic","id":"37424142600"},{"name":"Leonard M.

A model for the radar imaging process is derived in this paper and a method for smoothing noisy radar images is also presented. The imaging model shows that the radar image is corrupted by multiplicative noise. The model leads to the functional form of an optimum (minimum MSE) filter for smoothing radar images. By using locally estimated parameter values the filter is made adaptive so that it provides minimum MSE estimates inside homogeneous areas of an image while preserving the edge structure. It is shown that the filter can be easily implemented in the spatial domain and is computationally efficient. The performance of the adaptive filter is compared (qualitatively and quantitatively) with several standard filters using real and simulated radar images.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767208/04767223.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767208","startPage":"157","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model for Radar Images and Its Application to Adaptive Digital Filtering of Multiplicative Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Model for Radar Images and Its Application to Adaptive Digital Filtering of Multiplicative Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767223/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1982","pubMedId":"21869022","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model for Radar Images and Its Application to Adaptive Digital Filtering of Multiplicative Noise","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-4-n2-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039908S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"4767208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1162","articleId":"4767223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4767224,"authors":[{"name":"Howard Elliott","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Howard","lastName":"Elliott","id":"37701870700"},{"name":"David B.

First, a necessary and sufficient condition for a line drawing to correctly represent a polyhedron is obtained in terms of linear algebra. Next, combinatorial structures are investigated and practical solutions are obtained to such problems as how to discriminate between correct and incorrect line drawings and how to correct vertex-position errors in incorrect line drawings. Lastly, distribution of the degree of freedom of a line drawing is elucidated and a method is proposed for interactive reconstruction of a polyhedron from a line drawing. The results obtained here enable us to make manmachine communication more ``flexible'' in the sense that a machine can reconstruct three-dimensional objects from hand-drawn pictures even if the pictures are not perfect.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767289","startPage":"458","endPage":"469","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767284/04767289.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1982.4767289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathematical Structures of Line Drawings of Polyhedrons\u2014Toward Man-Machine Communication by Means of Line Drawings","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Man machine systems","Sufficient conditions","Image analysis","Engineering drawings","Shape","Surface texture","Design automation","Linear algebra","Error correction","Machine intelligence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision","flexible communication","hand-drawn pictures","imperfect pictures","line drawings of polyhedrons","machine intelligence","man-machine communication","polyhedral scenes","scene analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Mathematical Structures of Line Drawings of Polyhedrons\u2014Toward Man-Machine Communication by Means of Line Drawings","volume":"PAMI-4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"21869064","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathematical Structures of Line Drawings of Polyhedrons\u2014Toward Man-Machine Communication by Means of Line Drawings","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-4-n5-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03802S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"4767284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"93","articleId":"4767289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767295,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroyasu Murakami","affiliation":["Semiconductor Device Engineering Laboratory, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyasu","lastName":"Murakami","id":"38186879400"},{"name":"B.

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767334/04767341.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markov Random Field Texture Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Markov Random Field Texture Models","volume":"PAMI-5","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1983","pubMedId":"21869080","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov Random Field Texture Models","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-5-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053288S","chronDate":"Jan.  1983","isNumber":"4767334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"857","articleId":"4767341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767345,"authors":[{"name":"Ramesh Jain","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109."],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Jain","id":"37279812500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767345","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":392},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image motion analysis","Focusing","Optical computing","Layout","Data mining","Image analysis","Image segmentation","Motion analysis","Optical arrays","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic scene analysis","focus of expansion","moving observer","optical flow","segmentation"]}],"abstract":"Optical flow carries valuable information about the nature and depth of surfaces and the relative motion between observer and objects.

The optical flow can then be computed using the focus of expansion.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767334/04767345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767334","startPage":"58","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Computation of the Focus of Expansion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct Computation of the Focus of Expansion","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1983","pubMedId":"21869084","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Computation of the Focus of Expansion","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-5-n1-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029828S","chronDate":"Jan.  1983","isNumber":"4767334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"55","articleId":"4767345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767347,"authors":[{"name":"Sankar K.

The scale invariance property of the Mellin transform provides a means for extracting features from the profiles which are insensitive to the aspect angle of the radar. Past implementations of the Mellin transform based on the FFT have required exponential sampling, interpolation, and the computation of a correction term, all of which introduce errors into the transform. In addition, exponential sampling results in a factor of ln N increase in the number of data points. An alternate implementation, developed in the paper, utilizes a direct expansion of the Mellin integral definition. This direct Mellin transform (DMT) eliminates the implementation problems associated with the FFT approach, and does not increase the number of samples. A scale and translation invariant transform is developed from a modification of the DMT. The MDMT applied to the FFT of the radar profiles results in the desired insensitivity without having the low-pass filtering characteristic that exists in other Fourier-Mellin implementations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar applications","Marine vehicles","Discrete transforms","Feature extraction","Fourier transforms","Radar imaging","Computed tomography","Sampling methods","Interpolation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature extraction","Fourier-Mellin transform","Mellin transform","modified Mellin transform","radar signatures","scale invariant","ship classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767371","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767371","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767360/04767371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767371","startPage":"191","endPage":"199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Implementation of the Mellin Transform and its Application to Radar Classification of Ships","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Implementation of the Mellin Transform and its Application to Radar Classification of Ships","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1983","volume":"PAMI-5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"March 1983","pubMedId":"21869100","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Implementation of the Mellin Transform and its Application to Radar Classification of Ships","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-5-n2-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058724S","chronDate":"March  1983","isNumber":"4767360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"78","articleId":"4767371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4767373,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767390","startPage":"267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767384/04767390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767390","endPage":"287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Foundations of Relaxation Labeling Processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1983","displayDocTitle":"On the Foundations of Relaxation Labeling Processes","volume":"PAMI-5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"May 1983","pubMedId":"21869111","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Foundations of Relaxation Labeling Processes","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-5-n3-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047478S","chronDate":"May  1983","isNumber":"4767384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"659","articleId":"4767390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767392,"authors":[{"name":"David B.

Boundaries may be those of a tank in an IR image, a spinal canal in a CAT scan, a cloud in a visible light image, etc. Or they may be internal to an object such as the boundary between a spherical surface and a cylindrical surface in a manufactured object. The focus of the paper is on parallel multiple-window boundary estimation algorithms. Here the image field is parti-tioned into an array of rectangular windows, and boundary finders are run simultaneously within the windows. The boundary segments found within the windows are then seamed together to obtain meaningful global boundaries. The entire procedure is treated within a maximum likelihood estimation framework that we have developed for boundary finding. Although our multiple-window estimation approach can be used with a number of local boundary finding algorithms, we concen-trate on one which is based on dynamic programming and will produce the true maximum likelihood boundary. Some theoretical considera-tions for boundary model design and boundary-finding runtime are covered. Included is the use of a low computational cost F-test for test-ing whether a window contains a boundary, and an analytical treatment which shows that use of coarse pixels with a chi-square test or an F-test improves the probability of correctly recognizing whether a boundary is present in a window.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767392","startPage":"299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767384/04767392.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767392","endPage":"316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Window Parallel Adaptive Boundary Finding in Computer Vision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767392/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1983","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Window Parallel Adaptive Boundary Finding in Computer Vision","volume":"PAMI-5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"May 1983","pubMedId":"21869113","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Window Parallel Adaptive Boundary Finding in Computer Vision","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-5-n3-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078328S","chronDate":"May  1983","isNumber":"4767384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4767392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767405,"authors":[{"name":"Masaki Oshima","affiliation":["Electro Technical Laboratory, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Oshima","id":"37387308900"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Shirai","affiliation":["Electro Technical Laboratory, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiaki","lastName":"Shirai","id":"38186776300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767405","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":190,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":316},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper describes an approach to the recognition of stacked objects with planar and curved surfaces. The system works in two phases. In the learning phase, a scene containing a single object is shown one at a time. The range data of a scene are obtained by a range finder. The description of each scene is built in terms of properties of regions and relations between them. This description is stored as an object model. In the recognition phase, an unknown scene is described in the same way as in the learning phase.

This paper describes an Automated Lumber Processing System (ALPS) that employs computer tomography, optical scanning technology, the calculation of an optimum cutting strategy, and a computer-driven laser cutting device. While certain major hardware components of ALPS are already commercially available, a major missing element is the automatic inspection system needed to locate and identify surface defects on boards. This paper reports research aimed at developing such an inspection system. The basic strategy is to divide the digital image of a board into a number of disjoint rectangular regions and classify each independently. This simple procedure has the advantage of allowing an obvious parallel processing implementation. The study shows that measures of tonal and pattern related qualities are needed. The tonal measures are the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the gray levels. The pattern related measures are those based on cooccurrence matrices. In this initial feasibility study, these combined measures yielded an overall 88.3 percent correct classification on the eight defects most commonly found in lumber. To minimize the number of calculations needed to make the required classifications a sequential classifier is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767446","startPage":"573","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767440","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767440/04767446.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying and Locating Surface Defects in Wood: Part of an Automated Lumber Processing System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767446/","displayDocTitle":"Identifying and Locating Surface Defects in Wood: Part of an Automated Lumber Processing System","volume":"PAMI-5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"21869143","publicationDate":"Nov. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying and Locating Surface Defects in Wood: Part of an Automated Lumber Processing System","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-5-n6-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048504S","chronDate":"Nov.  1983","isNumber":"4767440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"139","articleId":"4767446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4767447,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It is based on nonparametric extensions of commonly used scatter matrices. Two advantages result from the use of the proposed nonparametric scatter matrices. First, they are generally of full rank. This provides the ability to specify the number of extracted features desired. This is in contrast to parametric discriminant analysis, which for an L class problem typically can determine at most L 1 features. Second, the nonparametric nature of the scatter matrices allows the procedure to work well even for non-Gaussian data sets. Using the same basic framework, a procedure is proposed to test the structural similarity of two distributions. The procedure works in high-dimensional space. It specifies a linear decomposition of the original data space in which a relative indication of dissimilarity along each new basis vector is provided. The nonparametric scatter matrices are also used to derive a clustering procedure, which is recognized as a k-nearest neighbor version of the nonparametric valley seeking algorithm. The form which results provides a unified view of the parametric nearest mean reclassification algorithm and the nonparametric valley seeking algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767440/04767461.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1983.4767461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Scattering","Covariance matrix","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Data mining","Testing","Aerospace engineering","Instruments","Equations","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","dimensionality reduction","discriminant analysis","distributional tests","linear mapping","nonparametric feature extraction","scatter matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis","volume":"PAMI-5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1983","pubMedId":"21869158","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-5-n6-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03517S","chronDate":"Nov.  1983","isNumber":"4767440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"163","articleId":"4767461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767471,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Y.

First, we show that seven point correspondences are sufficient to uniquely determine from two perspective views the three-dimensional motion parameters (within a scale factor for the translations) of a rigid object with curved surfaces. The seven points should not be traversed by two planes with one plane containing the origin, nor by a cone containing the origin. Second, a set of ``essential parameters'' are introduced which uniquely determine the motion parameters up to a scale factor for the translations, and can be estimated by solving a set of linear equations which are derived from the correspondences of eight image points.

Shape matching is viewed as a ``segment matching'' problem. Unlike the previous work, the technique is based on a stochastic labeling procedure which explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. To reduce the computation time, the technique is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. This basic technique has been extended to the situation where various objects partially occlude each other to form an apparent object and our interest is to find all the objects participating in the occlusion. In such a case several hierarchical processes are executed in parallel for every object participating in the occlusion and are coordinated in such a way that the same segment of the apparent object is not matched to the segments of different actual objects. These techniques have been applied to two-dimensional simple closed curves represented by polygons and the power of the techniques is demonstrated by the examples taken from synthetic, aerial, industrial and biological images where the matching is done after using the actual segmentation methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767494/04767499.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape Matching of Two-Dimensional Objects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767499/","displayDocTitle":"Shape Matching of Two-Dimensional Objects","volume":"PAMI-6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1984","pubMedId":"21869179","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape Matching of Two-Dimensional Objects","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-6-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042699S","chronDate":"March  1984","isNumber":"4767494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"145","articleId":"4767499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767501,"authors":[{"name":"Alex P.

The degree of mismatch, i.e., the distance, is measured in terms of the number of node splitting and merging operations required. The proposed tree distance is a more appropriate measurement of structural defonnation than the tree distance measure in terms of the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions of tree nodes, as defined in previous studies. An algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy is presented. The analysis shows that the time complexity is O(NM2) where N and Al are the number of nodes of the two trees, respectively. The algorithm has been implemented on a VAX 11/780.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767494/04767511.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Tree-Matching Algorithm Based on Node Splitting and Merging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Merging","Image segmentation","Signal processing algorithms","Histograms","Clustering algorithms","Labeling","Statistical analysis","Statistics","Layout","Speech processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distance","divide-and-conquer","node merging","node splitting","pattern correlation","tree matching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1984","displayDocTitle":"A Tree-Matching Algorithm Based on Node Splitting and Merging","volume":"PAMI-6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1984","pubMedId":"21869190","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tree-Matching Algorithm Based on Node Splitting and Merging","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-6-n2-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025971S","chronDate":"March  1984","isNumber":"4767494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"42","articleId":"4767511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4767522,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper presents a parallel Earley's recognition algorithm in terms of an ``X*'' operator. By restricting the input context-free grammar to be \u03bb-free, the parallel algorithm can be executed on a triangular-shape VLSI array. This array system has an efficient way of moving data to the right place at the right time. Simulation results show that this system can recognize a string with length n in 2n + 1 system time. We also present a parallel parse-extraction algorithm, a complete parsing algorithm, and an error-correcting recognition algorithm. The parallel complete parsing algorithm has been simulated on a processor array which is similar to the triangular VLSI array. For an input string of length n the processor array will give the correct right-parse at system time 2n + 1 if the string is accepted. The error-correcting recognition algorithm has also been simulated on a triangular VLSI array. This array recognizes an erroneous string of length n in time 2n + 1 and gives the correct error count. These parallel algorithms are especially useful for syntactic pattern recognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Parsing Algorithms and VLSI Implementations for Syntactic Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767522","startPage":"302","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767514/04767522.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1984","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Parsing Algorithms and VLSI Implementations for Syntactic Pattern Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"PAMI-6","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1984","pubMedId":"21869196","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Parsing Algorithms and VLSI Implementations for Syntactic Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-6-n3-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0333S","chronDate":"May  1984","isNumber":"4767514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"53","articleId":"4767522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767545,"authors":[{"name":"Shunji Mori","affiliation":["Nippon Schlumberger K.

Both from the practical and the academic point of view, very encouraging results are reported. The work is described systematically and analyzed in terms of so-called feature matching, which is likely to be the mainstream of the research and development of machine recognition of handprinted Chinese characters. A database, ETL8 (881 Kanji, 71 hirakana, and 160 variations for each category), is explained, on which many experiments were performed. Recognition rates reported using this database can be compared, and so somewhat qualitative evaluation of these methods is described.

Accordingly, an image is partitioned into small square windows, each of which is a view of a piece of a sphere, or of a cylinder, or of a plane. Windows are processed in parallel for recognition of content. New concepts and techniques include approximations of the image within a window by 2-D quadric polynomials where each approximation is constrained by one of the hypotheses that the 3-D surface shape seen is either planar, cylindrical, or spherical; a recognizer based upon these approximations to determine whether the object patch viewed is a piece of a sphere, or a piece of a cylinder, or a piece of a plane; lowpass filtering of the image by the approximation. The shape recognition is computationally simple, and for large windows is approximately Bayesian minimum-probability-of-error recognition. These classifications are useful for many purposes. One such purpose is to enable a following processor to use an appropriate estimator to estimate shape, and orientation and location parameters for the 3-D surface seen within a window.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767540/04767547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767540","startPage":"418","endPage":"429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Recognition of Local 3-D Shape by Approximating Image Intensity Functions with Quadric Polynomials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Recognition of Local 3-D Shape by Approximating Image Intensity Functions with Quadric Polynomials","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767547/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1984","pubMedId":"21869210","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Recognition of Local 3-D Shape by Approximating Image Intensity Functions with Quadric Polynomials","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-6-n4-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030145S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"4767540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"62","articleId":"4767547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767553,"authors":[{"name":"Margaret Chock","affiliation":["M.

To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767587/04767591.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractal-Based Description of Natural Scenes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Fractal-Based Description of Natural Scenes","volume":"PAMI-6","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"22499648","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767591/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractal-Based Description of Natural Scenes","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-6-n6-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026533S","chronDate":"Nov.  1984","isNumber":"4767587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1212","articleId":"4767591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767593,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Daniel Dessimoz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Jean-Daniel","lastName":"Dessimoz","id":"37427714500"},{"name":"John R.

This paper presents the application of matched filters for enabling robots with vision to acquire workpieces randomly stored in bins. This approach complements heuristic methods already reported. The concept of matched filter is an old one. Here, however, it is redefined to take into account robot end-effector features, in terms of geometry and mechanics. In particular, the proposed filters match local workpiece structures where the robot end-effector is likely to grasp successfully and hold workpieces. The local nature of the holdsites is very important as computation costs are shown to vary with the fifth power of structure size. In addition, the proposed filters tend to have a narrow angular bandwidth. An example, which features a parallel-jaw hand is developed in detail, using both statistical and Fourier models. Both approaches concur in requiring a very small number of filters (typically four), even if a good orientation accuracy is expected (two degrees). Success rates of about 90 percent in three or fewer attempts have been experimentally obtained on a system which includes a small minicomputer, a 128 \u00d7 128 pixel solidstate camera, a prototype Cartesian robot, and a ``universal'' parallel-jaw hand.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Robotic assembly","Robot vision systems","Materials handling","Computational geometry","Computational efficiency","Bandwidth","Power system modeling","Microcomputers","Cameras"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","bin picking","robot control","robot vision","scene analysis"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767593","startPage":"686","endPage":"697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767587/04767593.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matched Filters for Bin Picking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Matched Filters for Bin Picking","pubMedId":"22499650","publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","volume":"PAMI-6","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched Filters for Bin Picking","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-6-n6-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067075S","chronDate":"Nov.  1984","isNumber":"4767587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4767593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767594,"authors":[{"name":"Yaser S.

The Bayes smoothing algorithm yields the a posteriori distribution of the scene value at each pixel, given the total noisy image, in a recursive way. The a posteriori distribution together with a criterion of optimality then determine a Bayes estimate of the scene. The algorithm presented is an extension of a 1-D Bayes smoothing algorithm to 2-D and it gives the optimum Bayes estimate for the scene value at each pixel. Computational concerns in 2-D, however, necessitate certain simplifying assumptions on the model and approximations on the implementation of the algorithm. In particular, the scene (noiseless image) is modeled as a Markov mesh random field, a special class of Markov random fields, and the Bayes smoothing algorithm is applied on overlapping strips (horizontal/vertical) of the image consisting of several rows (columns). It is assumed that the signal (scene values) vector sequence along the strip is a vector Markov chain. Since signal correlation in one of the dimensions is not fully used along the edges of the strip, estimates are generated only along the middle sections of the strips. The overlapping strips are chosen such that the union of the middle sections of the strips gives the whole image. The Bayes smoothing algorithm presented here is valid for scene random fields consisting of multilevel (discrete) or continuous random variables.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767587/04767595.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayes Smoothing Algorithms for Segmentation of Binary Images Modeled by Markov Random Fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Image segmentation","Markov random fields","Layout","Strips","Random variables","Cost function","Additive noise","Pixel","Signal generators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayes smoothing","image segmentation","Markov random fields"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Bayes Smoothing Algorithms for Segmentation of Binary Images Modeled by Markov Random Fields","volume":"PAMI-6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","pubMedId":"22499652","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayes Smoothing Algorithms for Segmentation of Binary Images Modeled by Markov Random Fields","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-6-n6-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115809S","chronDate":"Nov.  1984","isNumber":"4767587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"143","articleId":"4767595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4767596,"authors":[{"name":"Stuart Geman","affiliation":["Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Geman","id":"37374975700"},{"name":"Donald Geman","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Geman","id":"37271298400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767596","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10982,"citationCountPatent":124,"totalDownloads":14604},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Bayesian methods","Image restoration","Degradation","Markov random fields","Additive noise","Deformable models","Temperature distribution","Energy states","Annealing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Annealing","Gibbs distribution","image restoration","line process","MAP estimate","Markov random field","relaxation","scene modeling","spatial degradation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767596","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767587/04767596.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767596","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and the Bayesian Restoration of Images","abstract":"We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1984","volume":"PAMI-6","issue":"6","pubMedId":"22499653","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and the Bayesian Restoration of Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and the Bayesian Restoration of Images","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-6-n6-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043667S","chronDate":"Nov.  1984","isNumber":"4767587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"10982","articleId":"4767596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4767600,"authors":[{"name":"Vipin Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Vipin","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38190115300"},{"name":"Laveen N.

The stereo matching problem, that is, obtaining a correspondence between right and left images, can be cast as a search problem. When a pair of stereo images is rectified, pairs of corresponding points can be searched for within the same scanlines. We call this search intra-scanline search. This intra-scanline search can be treated as the problem of finding a matching path on a two-dimensional (2D) search plane whose axes are the right and left scanlines. Vertically connected edges in the images provide consistency constraints across the 2D search planes. Inter-scanline search in a three-dimensional (3D) search space, which is a stack of the 2D search planes, is needed to utilize this constraint. Our stereo matching algorithm uses edge-delimited intervals as elements to be matched, and employs the above mentioned two searches: one is inter-scanline search for possible correspondences of connected edges in right and left images and the other is intra-scanline search for correspondences of edge-delimited intervals on each scanline pair. Dynamic programming is used for both searches which proceed simultaneously: the former supplies the consistency constraint to the latter while the latter supplies the matching score to the former. An interval-based similarity metric is used to compute the score. The algorithm has been tested with different types of images including urban aerial images, synthesized images, and block scenes, and its computational requirement has been discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo by Intra- and Inter-Scanline Search Using Dynamic Programming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767639","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767634/04767639.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1985","displayDocTitle":"Stereo by Intra- and Inter-Scanline Search Using Dynamic Programming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-7","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"March 1985","pubMedId":"21869253","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo by Intra- and Inter-Scanline Search Using Dynamic Programming","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-7-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031304S","chronDate":"March  1985","isNumber":"4767634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"600","articleId":"4767639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767640,"authors":[{"name":"Martin D.

Uniformity within each region and contrast between adjacent regions serve as parameters for region analysis. Contrast across lines and connectivity between them represent measures for line analysis. Texture is depicted by the introduction of focus of attention areas as groups of regions and lines. The performance parameters are then measured separately for each area. The usefulness of this approach lies in the ability to adjust the strategy of a system according to the varying characteristics of different areas.

The filter is noise smoothing and adapts to local changes in image statistics based on a nonstationary mean, nonstationary variance (NMNV) image model. For images degraded by a class of uncorrelated, signal-dependent noise without blur, the adaptive noise smoothing filter becomes a point processor and is similar to Lee's local statistics algorithm [16]. The filter is able to adapt itself to the nonstationary local image statistics in the presence of different types of signal-dependent noise. For multiplicative noise, the adaptive noise smoothing filter is a systematic derivation of Lee's algorithm with some extensions that allow different estimators for the local image variance. The advantage of the derivation is its easy extension to deal with various types of signal-dependent noise. Film-grain and Poisson signal-dependent restoration problems are also considered as examples. All the nonstationary image statistical parameters needed for the filter can be estimated from the noisy image and no a priori information about the original image is required.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767634/04767641.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Noise Smoothing Filter for Images with Signal-Dependent Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1985","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Noise Smoothing Filter for Images with Signal-Dependent Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767641/","publicationDate":"March 1985","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"21869255","volume":"PAMI-7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Noise Smoothing Filter for Images with Signal-Dependent Noise","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-7-n2-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071363S","chronDate":"March  1985","isNumber":"4767634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"937","articleId":"4767641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4767645,"authors":[{"name":"Russ Miller","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Russ","lastName":"Miller","id":"37348011000"},{"name":"Quentin F.

In this paper, we present a method to transform a recursive computation task into a VLSI structure systematically. The main advantages of this approach are its simplicity and completeness. Several examples, such as vector inner product, matrix multiplication, convolution, comparison operations in relational database and fast Fourier transformation (FFT), are given to demonstrate the transformation procedure. Finally, we apply the proposed method to hierarchical scene matching.

We derive an edge detection algorithm sensitive to changes in flow fields likely to be associated with occlusion. The algorithm is patterned after the Marr-Hildreth zero-crossing detectors currently used to locate boundaries in scalar fields. Zero-crossing detectors are extended to identify changes in direction and/or magnitude in a vector-valued flow field. As a result, the detector works for flow boundaries generated due to the relative motion of two overlapping surfaces, as well as the simpler case of motion parallax due to a sensor moving through an otherwise stationary environment. We then show how the approach can be extended to identify which side of a dynamic occlusion boundary corresponds to the occluding surface. The fundamental principal involved is that at an occlusion boundary, the image of the surface boundary moves with the image of the occluding surface. Such information is important in interpreting dynamic scenes. Results are demonstrated on optical flow fields automatically computed from real image sequences.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767672/04767677.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"383","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Occlusion Analysis in Optical Flow Fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1985","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Occlusion Analysis in Optical Flow Fields","publicationDate":"July 1985","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"21869276","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-7","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Occlusion Analysis in Optical Flow Fields","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-7-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033419S","chronDate":"July  1985","isNumber":"4767672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"105","articleId":"4767677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4767678,"authors":[{"name":"Gilad Adiv","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Gilad","lastName":"Adiv","id":"38161826600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767678","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":582,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":2567},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"A new approach for the interpretation of optical flow fields is presented. The flow field, which can be produced by a sensor moving through an environment with several independently moving, rigid objects, is allowed to be sparse, noisy, and partially incorrect. The approach is based on two main stages. In the first stage, the flow field is partitioned into connected segments of flow vectors, where each segment is consistent with a rigid motion of a roughly planar surface. In the second stage, segments are grouped under the hypothesis that they are induced by a single, rigidly moving object. Each hypothesis is tested by searching for three-dimensional (3-D) motion parameters which are compatible with all the segments in the corresponding group. Once the motion parameters are recovered, the relative environmental depth can be estimated as well. Experiments based on real and simulated data are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767672/04767678.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining Three-Dimensional Motion and Structure from Optical Flow Generated by Several Moving Objects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image motion analysis","Optical sensors","Optical noise","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Testing","Motion estimation","Motion analysis","Optical computing","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision","dynamic scene analysis","generalized Hough transform","multiple moving objects","multiresolution search","optical flow","recovering three-dimensional motion parameters","segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1985","displayDocTitle":"Determining Three-Dimensional Motion and Structure from Optical Flow Generated by Several Moving Objects","volume":"PAMI-7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1985","pubMedId":"21869277","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining Three-Dimensional Motion and Structure from Optical Flow Generated by Several Moving Objects","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-7-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0526S","chronDate":"July  1985","isNumber":"4767672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"582","articleId":"4767678","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767680,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry L.

In particular, the principal variation splitting method has been implemented, and experimental results are presented which show how such refinements as progressive deepening, narrow window searching, and the use of memory tables affect the performance of multiprocessor based chess playing programs. When dealing with parallel processing systems, communication delays are perhaps the greatest source of lost time. Therefore, an implementation of our tree decomposition based algorithm is presented, one that operates with a modest amount of message passing within a network of processors. Since our system has low search overhead, the principal basis for comparison is the communication overhead, which in turn is shown to have two components.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767672/04767683.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"452","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Game-Tree Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767683/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1985","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Game-Tree Search","publicationDate":"July 1985","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"21869282","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-7","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Game-Tree Search","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-7-n4-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042092S","chronDate":"July  1985","isNumber":"4767672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"41","articleId":"4767683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4767684,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hsiang Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and the Microelectronics and Information Science and Technology Research Center, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Hsiang","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37287043400"},{"name":"Shiaw-Shian Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Control Systems, Electronics Researchand Service Organization, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shiaw-Shian","lastName":"Yu","id":"37350520100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767684","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Merging","Shape","Pattern recognition","Noise shaping","Information science","Information analysis","Microelectronics","Control systems","Industrial electronics","Electrical equipment industry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attributed strings","boundary primitives","combined primitives","edit distances","matching with merging","shape recognition","string edit operations","string matching"]}],"abstract":"A new structural approach to shape recognition using attributed string matching with merging is proposed. After illustrating the disadvantages of conventional symbolic string matching using changes, deletions, and insertions, attributed strings are suggested for matching. Each attributed string is an ordered sequence of shape boundary primitives, each representing a basic boundary structural unit, line segment, with two types of numerical attributes, length and direction. A new type of primitive edit operation, called merge, is then introduced, which can be used to combine and then match any number of consecutive boundary primitives in one shape with those in another. The resulting attributed string matching with merging approach is shown useful for recognizing distorted shapes. Experimental results prove the feasibility of the proposed approach for general shape recognition. Some possible extensions of the approach are also included.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767672/04767684.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1985.4767684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767672","startPage":"453","endPage":"462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attributed String Matching with Merging for Shape Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Attributed String Matching with Merging for Shape Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767684/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1985","pubMedId":"21869283","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attributed String Matching with Merging for Shape Recognition","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-7-n4-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038172S","chronDate":"July  1985","isNumber":"4767672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"93","articleId":"4767684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4767704,"authors":[{"name":"David M.

It deals with both the probabilistic and the structural aspects of relational data. By interpreting an ensemble of attributed graphs as the outcomes of a random graph, we can use its lower order distribution to characterize the ensemble. To reflect the variability of a random graph, Shannon's entropy measure is used. To synthesize an ensemble of attributed graphs into the distribution of a random graph (or a set of distributions), we propose a distance measure between random graphs based on the minimum change of entropy before and after their merging. When the ensemble contains more than one class of pattern graphs, the synthesis process yields distributions corresponding to various classes. This process corresponds to unsupervised learning in pattern classification. Using the maximum likelihood rule and the probability computed for the pattern graph, based on its matching with the random graph distributions of different classes, we can classify the pattern graph to a class.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1985","volume":"PAMI-7","issue":"5","pubMedId":"21869297","publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Entropy and Distance of Random Graphs with Application to Structural Pattern Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy and Distance of Random Graphs with Application to Structural Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-7-n5-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070104S","chronDate":"Sept.  1985","isNumber":"4767693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"205","articleId":"4767707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4767723,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Shahraray","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Shahraray","id":"37297167100"},{"name":"David J.

Several applications of the representation are sketched.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767747","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767742/04767747.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767747","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"2","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Curvature Primal Sketch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1986","displayDocTitle":"The Curvature Primal Sketch","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767747/","volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1986","pubMedId":"21869318","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Curvature Primal Sketch","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n1-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05777S","chronDate":"Jan.  1986","isNumber":"4767742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"454","articleId":"4767747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4767749,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Babaud","affiliation":["Schlumberger Computer Aided Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Babaud","id":"38189035400"},{"name":"Andrew P.

The object identification technique is insensitive to object size and orientation. Three pattern recognition algorithms that assign object names to unlabelled sets of AR model parameters were tested and the results compared. Isolated object tests were performed on five sets of shapes, including eight industrial shapes (mostly taken from the recognition literature), and recognition accuracies of 100 percent were obtained for all pattern sets at some model order in the range 1 to 10. Test results indicate the ability of the technique developed in this work to recognize partially occluded objects. Processing-speed measurements show that the method is fast in the recognition mode. The results of a number of object recognition tests are presented. The recognition technique was realized with Fortran programs, Imaging Technology, Inc. image-processing boards, and a PDP 11/60 computer. The computer algorithms are described.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Computer vision","Robot vision systems","Electrical equipment industry","Manufacturing industries","Robotic assembly","Testing","Robotics and automation","Pattern recognition","Computer industry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autoregressive model","computer vision","partial occlusion","robot vision","shape description","shape recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767742/04767752.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Autoregressive Model Approach to Two-Dimensional Shape Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Autoregressive Model Approach to Two-Dimensional Shape Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767752/","volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1986","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"21869323","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Autoregressive Model Approach to Two-Dimensional Shape Classification","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n1-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028304S","chronDate":"Jan.  1986","isNumber":"4767742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"159","articleId":"4767752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4767753,"authors":[{"name":"James George Dunham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"James George","lastName":"Dunham","id":"38186603600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767753","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":206,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1112},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Piecewise linear approximation","Approximation algorithms","Piecewise linear techniques","Iterative algorithms","Shape","Pattern analysis","Pattern classification","Feature extraction","Merging","Strips"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal approximation","piecewise linear approximation","planar curve segmentation","polygonal approximation","scan-along"]}],"abstract":"Two-dimensional digital curves are often uniformly approximated by polygons or piecewise linear curves.

The problem considered is that of a rigid body undergoing unknown rotational and translational motion. The measurement data consists of a sequence of noisy image coordinates of two or more object correspondence points. By modeling the object dynamics as a function of time, estimates of the model parameters (including motion parameters) can be extracted from the data using recursive and/or batch techniques. This permits a desired degree of smoothing to be achieved through the use of an arbitrarily large number of images. Some assumptions regarding object structure are presently made. Results are presented for a recursive estimation procedure: the case considered here is that of a sequence of one dimensional images of a two dimensional object. Thus, the object moves in one transverse dimension, and in depth, preserving the fundamental ambiguity of the central projection image model (loss of depth information). An iterated extended Kalman filter is used for the recursive solution. Noise levels of 5-10 percent of the object image size are used. Approximate Cramer-Rao lower bounds are derived for the model parameter estimates as a function of object trajectory and noise level. This approach may be of use in situations where it is difficult to resolve large numbers of object match points, but relatively long sequences of images (10 to 20 or more) are available.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767742/04767755.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Object Motion Parameters from Noisy Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Image motion analysis","Recursive estimation","Noise level","Parameter estimation","Image resolution","Motion analysis","Aerospace electronics","Optical noise","Coordinate measuring machines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image sequence analysis","iterated extended Kalman filter","motion","nonlinear filtering","time varying imagery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Object Motion Parameters from Noisy Images","volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1986","pubMedId":"21869326","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Object Motion Parameters from Noisy Images","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n1-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0259S","chronDate":"Jan.  1986","isNumber":"4767742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"305","articleId":"4767755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767767,"authors":[{"name":"Demetri Terzopoulos","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, M.I.T., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Demetri","lastName":"Terzopoulos","id":"37269517400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767767","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":272,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":478},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"Image analysis problems, posed mathematically as variational principles or as partial differential equations, are amenable to numerical solution by relaxation algorithms that are local, iterative, and often parallel. Although they are well suited structurally for implementation on massively parallel, locally interconnected computational architectures, such distributed algorithms are seriously handi capped by an inherent inefficiency at propagating constraints between widely separated processing elements. Hence, they converge extremely slowly when confronted by the large representations of early vision. Application of multigrid methods can overcome this drawback, as we showed in previous work on 3-D surface reconstruction. In this paper, we develop multiresolution iterative algorithms for computing lightness, shape-from-shading, and optical flow, and we examine the efficiency of these algorithms using synthetic image inputs. The multigrid methodology that we describe is broadly applicable in early vision. Notably, it is an appealing strategy to use in conjunction with regularization analysis for the efficient solution of a wide range of ill-posed image analysis problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767763/04767767.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767763","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Analysis Using Multigrid Relaxation Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Relaxation methods","Iterative algorithms","Partial differential equations","Concurrent computing","Distributed computing","Computer architecture","Distributed algorithms","Optical propagation","Ultraviolet sources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image analysis","inverse problems","lightness","multigrid relaxation","multiresolution algorithms","optical flow","parallel algorithms","partial differential equations","shape from shading","variational principles"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","displayDocTitle":"Image Analysis Using Multigrid Relaxation Methods","volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1986","pubMedId":"21869332","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Analysis Using Multigrid Relaxation Methods","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n2-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048516S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4767763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"272","articleId":"4767767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767769,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Torre","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Genova, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Torre","id":"37356160100"},{"name":"Tomaso A.

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767763/04767769.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767763","startPage":"147","endPage":"163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Edge Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Edge Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1986","pubMedId":"21869334","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Edge Detection","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056517S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4767763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"627","articleId":"4767769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4767772,"authors":[{"name":"Sharon A.

Given a subtracted digital angiogram of the chest, ANGY identifies and isolates the coronary vessels, while ignoring any nonvessel structures which may have arisen from noise, variations in background contrast, imperfect subtraction, and irrelevent anatomical detail. The overall system is modularized into three stages: the preprocessing stage and the two stages embodied in the expert itself. In the preprocessing stage, low-level image processing routines written in C are used to create a segmented representation of the input image. These routines are applied sequentially. The expert system is rule-based and is written in OPS5 and LISP. It is separated into two stages: The low-level image processing stage embodies a domain-independent knowledge of segmentation, grouping, and shape analysis.

The high-level medical stage embodies a domain-dependent knowledge of cardiac anatomy and physiology. Applying this knowledge to the objects and relations determined in the preceding two stages, it identifies those objects which are vessels and eliminates all others.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ANGY: A Rule-Based Expert System for Automatic Segmentation of Coronary Vessels From Digital Subtracted Angiograms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767772","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767763/04767772.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767763","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","displayDocTitle":"ANGY: A Rule-Based Expert System for Automatic Segmentation of Coronary Vessels From Digital Subtracted Angiograms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"March 1986","pubMedId":"21869337","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANGY: A Rule-Based Expert System for Automatic Segmentation of Coronary Vessels From Digital Subtracted Angiograms","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n2-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06576S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4767763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"129","articleId":"4767772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4767775,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Alliney","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Matematica, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Alliney","id":"37348459200"},{"name":"Carlo Morandi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Automatica, Universit\u00e0 di Ancona, Ancona, Italy","Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informatica e Sistemistica, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Morandi","id":"37295134200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767775","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":494},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital images","Image registration","Cameras","Layout","Fourier transforms","Displays","Image processing","Pixel","Biomedical image processing","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital image processing","Fourier transform","image registration","matching algorithms","phase correlation","projection slice theorem"]}],"abstract":"In many application fields (e.g., aerospace and biomedical image processing), one has to deal with a sequence of images whose observation is made difficult by unpredictable relative movements of the camera and the scene.

In particular, we propose and exemplify an approximate fuzzy c-means (AFCM) implementation based upon replacing the necessary ``exact'' variates in the FCM equation with integer-valued or real-valued estimates. This approximation enables AFCM to exploit a lookup table approach for computing Euclidean distances and for exponentiation. The net effect of the proposed implementation is that CPU time during each iteration is reduced to approximately one sixth of the time required for a literal implementation of the algorithm, while apparently preserving the overall quality of terminal clusters produced. The two implementations are tested numerically on a nine-band digital image, and a pseudocode subroutine is given for the convenience of applications-oriented readers. Our results suggest that AFCM may be used to accelerate FCM processing whenever the feature space is comprised of tuples having a finite number of integer-valued coordinates.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767778","startPage":"248","endPage":"255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767763/04767778.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Implementation of the Fuzzy c-Means Clustering Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Table lookup","Image analysis","Fuzzy sets","Acceleration","Equations","Testing","Digital images","Pattern analysis","Image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate FCM","cluster analysis","efficient implementation","fuzzy c-means","image processing","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Implementation of the Fuzzy c-Means Clustering Algorithms","volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"21869343","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Implementation of the Fuzzy c-Means Clustering Algorithms","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n2-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079663S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4767763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"394","articleId":"4767778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4767807,"authors":[{"name":"Demetri Terzopoulos","affiliation":["Schlumberger Palo Alto Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Demetri","lastName":"Terzopoulos","id":"37269517400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767807","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":551,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":1174},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Constraint theory","Computer vision","Smoothing methods","Spline","Inverse problems","Artificial intelligence","Kernel","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Controlled-continuity constraints","discontinuities","early vision","inverse problems","reconstruction","regularization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767807","abstract":"Inverse problems, such as the reconstruction problems that arise in early vision, tend to be mathematically ill-posed. Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767801/04767807.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767807","startPage":"413","endPage":"424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularization of Inverse Visual Problems Involving Discontinuities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767807/","displayDocTitle":"Regularization of Inverse Visual Problems Involving Discontinuities","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"July 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularization of Inverse Visual Problems Involving Discontinuities","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037239S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"4767801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"551","articleId":"4767807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4767808,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In most situations, the mere gray value variations do not provide sufficient information in order to estimate such a displacement vector field. Supplementary constraints are necessary, for example the postulate that a displacement vector field varies smoothly as a function of the image position. Taken as a general requirement, this creates difficulties at gray value transitions which correspond to occluding contours. Nagel therefore introduced the ``oriented smoothness'' requirement which restricts variations of the displacement vector field only in directions with small or no variation of gray values. This contribution reports results of an investigation about how such an ``oriented smoothness'' constraint may be formulated and evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767829/04767833.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1986","displayDocTitle":"An Investigation of Smoothness Constraints for the Estimation of Displacement Vector Fields from Image Sequences","volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"5","pubMedId":"21869357","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation of Smoothness Constraints for the Estimation of Displacement Vector Fields from Image Sequences","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n5-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046787S","chronDate":"Sept.  1986","isNumber":"4767829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"561","articleId":"4767833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767838,"authors":[{"name":"Andres Huertas","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Huertas","id":"37299737600"},{"name":"Gerard Medioni","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"Medioni","id":"37280043300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767838","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":304,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1377},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Gaussian processes","Convolution","Filters","Image resolution","Polynomials","Data mining","Gaussian approximation","Pixel","Image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge operator","image processing","image segmentation","subpixel accuracy edge detection","zero-crossings of second derivative"]}],"abstract":"We present a system that takes a gray level image as input, locates edges with subpixel accuracy, and links them into lines.

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","volume":"PAMI-8","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Computational Approach to Edge Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computational Approach to Edge Detection","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-8-n6-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045642S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"4767846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"15899","articleId":"4767851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":4767855,"authors":[{"name":"Anne-Marie Derouault","affiliation":["IBM France Scientific Center, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Anne-Marie","lastName":"Derouault","id":"38151604300"},{"name":"Bernard Merialdo","affiliation":["IBM France Scientific Center, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Merialdo","id":"37386800500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767855","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":192},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper relates different kinds of language modeling methods that can be applied to the linguistic decoding part of a speech recognition system with a very large vocabulary.

This technique offers several potential advantages including increased speed and improved accuracy. In this approach we illuminate the scene with a single encoded grid of colored light stripes. The indexing problem, that of matching a detected image plane stripe with its position in the projection grid, is solved from a knowledge of the color grid encoding. In fact, the possibility exists for the first time to acquire high-resolution range data in real time for modest cost, since only a single projection and single color image are required. Grid to grid alignment problems associated with previous multistripe techniques are eliminated, as is the requirement for dark interstices between grid stripes. Scene illumination is more uniform, simplifying the stripe detection problem, and mechanical difficulties associated with the equipment design are significantly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767863/04767869.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color-Encoded Structured Light for Rapid Active Ranging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Color-Encoded Structured Light for Rapid Active Ranging","volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","pubMedId":"21869374","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color-Encoded Structured Light for Rapid Active Ranging","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027113S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"4767863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"256","articleId":"4767869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767871,"authors":[{"name":"Haluk Derin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Haluk","lastName":"Derin","id":"37352779200"},{"name":"Howard Elliott","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Howard","lastName":"Elliott","id":"37701870700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767871","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":735,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1704},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767871","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Parameter estimation","Image processing","Dynamic programming","Markov random fields","Computer vision","Application software","Stochastic processes","Image restoration","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision","estimation of parameters in Gibbs distributions","Gibbs distributions","Gibbs random fields","image processing","image segmentation","Markov random fields","textured image segmentation","texture modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767863/04767871.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Segmentation of Noisy and Textured Images Using Gibbs Random Fields","abstract":"This paper presents a new approach to the use of Gibbs distributions (GD) for modeling and segmentation of noisy and textured images.

By using a sequence of frames, it is possible to exploit the fact that due to inertia the motion of an object cannot change instantaneously. By using smoothness of motion, it is possible to solve the correspondence problem for arbitrary motion of several nonrigid objects in a scene. We formulate the correspondence problem as an optimization problem and propose an iterative algorithm to find trajectories of points in a monocular image sequence.

Two discriminant functions were applied to Chinese character recognition to evaluate their effectiveness, and remarkable improvement was observed in their performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767863/04767881.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767863","startPage":"149","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Quadratic Discriminant Functions and the Application to Chinese Character Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified Quadratic Discriminant Functions and the Application to Chinese Character Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","pubMedId":"21869386","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Quadratic Discriminant Functions and the Application to Chinese Character Recognition","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n1-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024853S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"4767863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"395","articleId":"4767881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767894,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Conrad Bovik","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Alan Conrad","lastName":"Bovik","id":"37283451200"},{"name":"Thomas S.

These are two-dimensional noncausal Markovian stochastic processes. Two conceptually new algorithms are presented for segmenting textured images into regions in each of which the data are modeled as one of C MRF's. The algorithms are designed to operate in real time when implemented on new parallel computer architectures that can be built with present technology. A doubly stochastic representation is used in image modeling. Here, a Gaussian MRF is used to model textures in visible light and infrared images, and an autobinary (or autoternary, etc.) MRF to model a priori information about the local geometry of textured image regions. For image segmentation, the true texture class regions are treated either as a priori completely unknown or as a realization of a binary (or ternary, etc.) MRF. In the former case, image segmentation is realized as true maximum likelihood estimation. In the latter case, it is realized as true maximum a posteriori likelihood segmentation. In addition to providing a mathematically correct means for introducing geometric structure, the autobinary (or ternary, etc.) MRF can be used in a generative mode to generate image geometries and artificial images, and such simulations constitute a very powerful tool for studying the effects of these models and the appropriate choice of model parameters. The first segmentation algorithm is hierarchical and uses a pyramid-like structure in new ways that exploit the mutual dependencies among disjoint pieces of a textured region.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"2","pubMedId":"21869391","publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Simple Parallel Hierarchical and Relaxation Algorithms for Segmenting Noncausal Markovian Random Fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Parallel Hierarchical and Relaxation Algorithms for Segmenting Noncausal Markovian Random Fields","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094067S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4767890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"166","articleId":"4767895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4767896,"authors":[{"name":"David W.

The maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion is used to formulate what the best segmentation or interpretation of the scene should be, where the scene is assumed to be made up of some fixed number of moving planar surface patches. The Bayesian approach requires, first, specification of prior expectations for the optic flow field, which here is modeled as spatial and temporal Markov random fields; and, secondly, a way of measuring how well the segmentation predicts the measured flow field. The Markov random fields incorporate the physical constraints that objects and their images are probably spatially continuous, and that their images are likely to move quite smoothly across the image plane. To compute the flow predicted by the segmentation, a recent method for reconstructing the motion and orientation of planar surface facets is used. The search for the globally optimal segmentation is performed using simulated annealing.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767890/04767896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767890","startPage":"220","endPage":"228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scene Segmentation from Visual Motion Using Global Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scene Segmentation from Visual Motion Using Global Optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1987","pubMedId":"21869392","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scene Segmentation from Visual Motion Using Global Optimization","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044772S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4767890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"217","articleId":"4767896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767897,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph K.

Many of the methods that recover this information require the determination of optical flow-the velocity, on the image, of visible points on object surfaces. An important class of techniques for estimating optical flow depend on the relationship between the gradients of image brightness. While gradient-based methods have been widely studied, little attention has been paid to accuracy and reliability of the approach. Gradient-based methods are sensitive to conditions commonly encountered in real imagery. Highly textured surfaces, large areas of constant brightness, motion boundaries, and depth discontinuities can all be troublesome for gradient-based methods. Fortunately, these problematic areas are usually localized can be identified in the image. In this paper we examine the sources of errors for gradient-based techniques that locally solve for optical flow. These methods assume that optical flow is constant in a small neighborhood. The consequence of violating in this assumption is examined. The causes of measurement errors and the determinants of the conditioning of the solution system are also considered. By understanding how errors arise, we are able to define the inherent limitations of the technique, obtain estimates of the accuracy of computed values, enhance the performance of the technique, and demonstrate the informative value of some types of error.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767890","startPage":"229","endPage":"244","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767890/04767897.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Flow Estimation: An Error Analysis of Gradient-Based Methods with Local Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optical Flow Estimation: An Error Analysis of Gradient-Based Methods with Local Optimization","publicationDate":"March 1987","pubMedId":"21869393","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Flow Estimation: An Error Analysis of Gradient-Based Methods with Local Optimization","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n2-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047094S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4767890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"207","articleId":"4767897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":4767901,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Kahan","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Labaratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Kahan","id":"37374849300"},{"name":"Theo Pavlidis","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Theo","lastName":"Pavlidis","id":"37357427000"},{"name":"Henry S.

Based on dynamics, a locally constant angular momentum (LCAM) model is introduced. The model is local in the sense that it is applied to a limited number of image frames at a time. Specifically, the model constrains the motion, over a local frame subsequence, to be a superposition of precession and translation. Thus, the instantaneous rotation axis of the object is allowed to change through the subsequence. The trajectory of the rotation center is approximated by a vector polynomial. The parameters of the model evolve in time so that they can adapt to long term changes in motion characteristics. The nature and parameters of short term motion can be estimated continuously with the goal of understanding motion through the image sequence. The estimation algorithm presented in this paper is linear, i.e., the algorithm consists of solving simultaneous linear equations. Based on the assumption that the motion is smooth, object positions and motion in the near future can be predicted, and short missing subsequences can be recovered. Noise smoothing is achieved by overdetermination and a leastsquares criterion. The framework is flexible in the sense that it allows both overdetermination in number of feature points and the number of image frames.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767914/04767920.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767914","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Motion Estimation, Understanding, and Prediction from Noisy Image Sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Image sequences","Motion analysis","Space vehicles","Polynomials","Equations","Smoothing methods","Noise level","Parameter estimation","Airplanes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision","dynamic model","image sequence analysis","motion","motion estimation","motion prediction","motion understanding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1987","displayDocTitle":"3-D Motion Estimation, Understanding, and Prediction from Noisy Image Sequences","volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1987","pubMedId":"22516631","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Motion Estimation, Understanding, and Prediction from Noisy Image Sequences","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n3-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033949S","chronDate":"May  1987","isNumber":"4767914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"120","articleId":"4767920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4767923,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Kuo Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Shi-Kuo","lastName":"Chang","id":"37281063000"},{"name":"Qing-Yun Shi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and the Information Science Center, Peking University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Qing-Yun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37067178100"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA","Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Yan","id":"38163461000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767923","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":415,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":419},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767923","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Vocabulary"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iconic indexing","pictorial information retrieval","string matching algorithms","two-dimensional string representation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we describe a new way of representing a symbolic picture by a two-dimensional string.

Previously, autofocus schemes have used depth of field to measured depth by searching for the lens setting that gives the best focus, repeating this search separately for each image point. This search is unnecessary, for there is a smooth gradient of focus as a function of depth. By measuring the amount of defocus, therefore, we can estimate depth simultaneously at all points, using only one or two images. It is proved that this source of information can be used to make reliable depth maps of useful accuracy with relatively minimal computation. Experiments with realistic imagery show that measurement of these optical gradients can provide depth information roughly comparable to stereo disparity or motion parallax, while avoiding image-to-image matching problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1987","publicationDate":"July 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","pubMedId":"21869410","volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A New Sense for Depth of Field","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Sense for Depth of Field","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027463S","chronDate":"July  1987","isNumber":"4767931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"705","articleId":"4767940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4767941,"authors":[{"name":"Robert M.

Range images, which directly measure 3-D surface coordinates of a scene, are well suited for this task. In this paper we report a procedure to detect connected planar, convex, and concave surfaces of 3-D objects. This is accomplished in three stages. The first stage segments the range image into ``surface patches'' by a square error criterion clustering algorithm using surface points and associated surface normals. The second stage classifies these patches as planar, convex, or concave based on a non-parametric statistical test for trend, curvature values, and eigenvalue analysis. In the final stage, boundaries between adjacent surface patches are classified as crease or noncrease edges, and this information is used to merge compatible patches to produce reasonable faces of the object(s).

As a problem in cryptography, the substitution cipher is of limited interest, but it has an important application in optical character recognition. Recent advances render it quite feasible to scan documents with a fairly complex layout and to classify (cluster) the printed characters into distinct groups according to their shape. However, given the immense variety of type styles and forms in current use, it is not possible to assign alphabetical identities to characters of arbitrary size and typeface. This gap can be bridged by solving the equivalent of a substitution cipher problem, thereby opening up the possibility of automatic translation of a scanned document into a standard character code, such as ASCII. Earlier methods relying on letter n-gram frequencies require a substantial amount of ciphertext for accurate n-gram estimates. A dictionary-based approach solves the problem using relatively small ciphertext samples and a dictionary of fewer than 500 words. Our heuristic backtrack algorithm typically visits only a few hundred among the 26! possible nodes on sample texts ranging from 100 to 600 words.","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767950/04767969.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767969","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767969","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767969","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Optical character recognition software","Frequency estimation","Natural languages","Cryptography","Character recognition","Shape","Code standards","Dictionaries","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptograms","dictionary based solution","heuristic search","optical character recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Decoding Substitution Ciphers by Means of Word Matching with Application to OCR","pubMedId":"21869433","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding Substitution Ciphers by Means of Word Matching with Application to OCR","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n5-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04389S","chronDate":"Sept.  1987","isNumber":"4767950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"28","articleId":"4767969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4767970,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein Almuallim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Almuallim","id":"37372665100"},{"name":"Shoichiro Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoichiro","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"38187616200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4767970","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":125,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":353},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Character recognition","Pattern recognition","Writing","Text recognition","Computer science","Petroleum","Minerals","Natural languages","Cameras"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arabic cursive handwriting","combination","pattern recognition","segmentation","strokes","structural approach"]}],"abstract":"In spite of the progress of machine recognition techniques of Latin, Kana, and Chinese characters over the two past decades, the machine recognition of Arabic characters has remained almost untouched.

We show that ``edge focusing'', i.e., a coarse-to-fine tracking in a continuous manner, combines high positional accuracy with good noise-reduction. This is of vital interest in several applications. Junctions of different kinds are in this way restored with high precision, which is a basic requirement when performing (projective) geometric analysis of an image for the purpose of restoring the three-dimensional scene. Segmentation of a scene using geometric clues like parallelism, etc., is also facilitated by the algorithm, since unnecessary detail has been filtered away. There are indications that an extension of the focusing algorithm can classify edges, to some extent, into the categories diffuse and nondiffuse (for example diffuse illumination edges). The edge focusing algorithm contains two parameters, namely the coarseness of the resolution in the blurred image from where we start the focusing procedure, and a threshold on the gradient magnitude at this coarse level. The latter parameter seems less critical for the behavior of the algorithm and is not present in the focusing part, i.e., at finer resolutions. The step length of the scale parameter in the focusing scheme has been chosen so that edge elements do not move more than one pixel per focusing step.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Focusing","Image edge detection","Image resolution","Image restoration","Layout","Gray-scale","Image analysis","Performance analysis","Image segmentation","Lighting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coarse-to-fine tracking","diffuse edges","edge detection","edge focusing","restoration of junctions","scale space","shadow edges"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4767975/04767980.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4767975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.1987.4767980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge Focusing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4767980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Edge Focusing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4767980/","volume":"PAMI-9","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"21869435","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Focusing","sourcePdf":"TPAMI-vPAMI-9-n6-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033901S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"4767975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"332","articleId":"4767980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4767983,"authors":[{"name":"Roman Kuc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Kuc","id":"37298845900"},{"name":"M.

A floor plan consisting of corners, walls, and edges is efficiently encoded to indicate which of these elements contribute to a particular pulse-echo response. Sonar maps produced by transducers having different resonant frequencies and transmitted pulse waveforms can then be simulated efficiently.

For LDPC decoding, the conventional belief propagation (BP) algorithm consists of numerous sub-decoders of single-parity check codes and exchanges information between sub-decoders in an iterative manner. If the single-parity check codes can be constructed and grouped in a proper way, the decoder can be decomposed into few identical 2-state trellis decoders. Therefore, instead of numerous sub-decoders of single-parity check codes, an iterative decoding algorithm based on few sub-decoders over 2-state trellis is proposed. The proposed decoding algorithm improves the efficiency of message passing between sub-decoders and hence provides a fast convergent rate as compared to the standard BP algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides a better performance and a fast convergent rate as compared to those of standard BP algorithm. The result also shows that the proposed algorithm has a similar performance as that of asynchronous replica shuffled BP algorithm and has a slightly inferior performance than that of synchronous replica shuffled BP algorithm. However, complexity analysis shows that our proposed algorithm has complexity that is lower than that of the replica shuffled BP algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-density parity-check codes with 2-state trellis decoding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.050650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4768558/04768562.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.050650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-density parity-check codes with 2-state trellis decoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4768562/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10417088","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-density parity-check codes with 2-state trellis decoding","sourcePdf":"0012-tc0901-chiu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044197S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4768558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4768558","articleId":"4768562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4768565,"authors":[{"name":"Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa","affiliation":["Telecommunications Field of Study, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand","Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Prathapasinghe","lastName":"Dharmawansa","id":"37541394300"},{"name":"Nandana Rajatheva","affiliation":["Telecommunications Field of Study, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Klong Luang, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Nandana","lastName":"Rajatheva","id":"37332381600"},{"name":"Hlaing Minn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Technology, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hlaing","lastName":"Minn","id":"37269620000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4768565","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1414},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768565","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Error analysis","Bit error rate","AWGN","Fading","Binary phase shift keying","Additive white noise","Quadrature phase shift keying","OFDM modulation","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error statistics","OFDM modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability analysis","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","bit error rate","symbol error rate","carrier frequency offset","additive white Gaussian noise channels","AWGN channels","frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels","BPSK","QPSK","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER), frequency offset, frequency selective fading, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), Rayleigh fading, symbol error rate (SER)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we derive exact closed form bit error rate (BER) or symbol error rate (SER) expressions for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with carrier frequency offset (CFO).

Such families facilitate the decoding hardware design and implementation for applications that require communication at different rates, for example to adapt to changing channel conditions. Combining rows of the lowest-rate parity-check matrix produces the parity-check matrices for higher rates. An important advantage of this approach is that all effective code rates have the same blocklength. This approach is compatible with well known techniques that allow low-complexity encoding and parallel decoding of these LDPC codes. This technique also allows the design of programmable analog LDPC decoders. The proposed design method maintains good graphical properties and hence low error floors for all rates.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4768558/04768574.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-rate low-density parity-check codes with constant blocklength","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-rate low-density parity-check codes with constant blocklength","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768574/","publicationDate":"January 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10417100","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4768574/","volume":"57","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-rate low-density parity-check codes with constant blocklength","sourcePdf":"0075-tc0901-casado.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086669S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4768558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4768558","articleId":"4768574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4768575,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The source and channel spaces can have different dimensions and thereby achieving either compression or error control, depending on whether the source bandwidth is smaller or larger than the channel bandwidth. We present a general theory for 1:N and M:1 dimension changing mappings, and provide two examples for a Gaussian source and channel where we optimize both a 2:1 bandwidth-reducing and a 1:2 bandwidth-expanding mapping.

While the optimal tradeoff curves for MIMO channels have been explicitly explored, those corresponding to some suboptimal and practical MIMO schemes are still open. One such important problem is the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for a V-BLAST type system employing ordered successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers with zero forcing (ZF) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) processing at each stage. In this paper, we take a novel geometrical approach and rigorously verify that under general settings, the optimal ordering rule for a V-BLAST SIC receiver will not improve its performance regarding diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in point-to- point channels. The same geometrical tool is then applied to MIMO spatial-division multiple access channels, leading to some first results in this area. Particularly, we reveal that when the rates of data streams are fixed (i.e., zero spatial multiplexing gain), the diversity order is not improved by user ordering.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4768558/04768579.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768558","startPage":"125","endPage":"133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for ordered MIMO SIC receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for ordered MIMO SIC receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10417102","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4768579/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for ordered MIMO SIC receivers","sourcePdf":"0125-tc0901-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085741S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4768558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4768558","articleId":"4768579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4768581,"authors":[{"name":"Shaw Wei Kok","affiliation":["Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4768558/4768581/4768581-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaw Wei Kok received his B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Nanyang Technological University, respectively in 2001 and 2007.

This equalization exploits the guard interval (GI) redundancy together with the excess codes (EC) to restore the structural properties of MC-CDMA signal destroyed by multipath fading channels. Indeed, since in CDMA based wireless systems, the number of users per cell is significantly less than the spreading factor, a base station can set apart a subset of the codes, the excess codes that will not be used for spreading. It is shown that the joint use of the EC and GI redundancy improves significantly the equalization performance compared to the GI only or EC only cases. A second contribution consists in exploiting the previous information together with the one given by a pilot sequence in a semi blind scheme to further improve the performance. Finally, we propose a new adaptive algorithm for the estimation and tracking of the equalizer that has a faster convergence rate compared to existing algorithms of similar complexity order. Simulation based performance evaluations are given at the end of this paper to assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods in MC-CDMA.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4768558/04768583.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind and semi-blind equalization of downlink MC-CDMA system exploiting guard interval redundancy and excess codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Downlink","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Signal restoration","Fading","Multiaccess communication","Base stations","Partial transmit sequences","Adaptive algorithm","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","code division multiple access","computational complexity","fading channels","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiblind equalization","downlink MC-CDMA system","guard interval redundancy","excess codes","blind time domain equalization technique","multicarrier code division multiple access systems","multipath fading channels","base station","pilot sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind equalization, guard interval redundancy, excess codes, MC-CDMA, adaptive algorithm, generalized eigendecomposition, semi-blind"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blind and semi-blind equalization of downlink MC-CDMA system exploiting guard interval redundancy and excess codes","volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4768583/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10417099","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind and semi-blind equalization of downlink MC-CDMA system exploiting guard interval redundancy and excess codes","sourcePdf":"0156-tc0901-djebbar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052228S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4768558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4768558","articleId":"4768583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4768585,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Pighi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4768558/4768585/4768585-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Riccardo Pighi (S'02\u2013M'08) was born in Piacenza, Italy, in November 1976.

We compare single carrier (SC) and multi-carrier (MC) transmission systems employing quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats. More precisely, we consider SC schemes with coded modulations and MC systems based on orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM). For the MC schemes, we introduce a theoretically equivalent channel model which makes the computation of the IR feasible. This simple channel model will be referred to as interleaved MC. We show that, in the presence of impulse noise and except for systems operating at very high spectral efficiency, the IR of MC schemes is lower than that of SC schemes. More precisely, use of MC schemes may lead to an unavoidable fundamental loss with respect to SC schemes at typical coding rates, whereas MC schemes are to be preferred for very high coding rates or in uncoded systems. These results hold for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and dispersive channels, either considering plain OFDM or MC schemes employing water-filling and bit-loading algorithms. In order to validate our theoretical results, we also obtain the bit error rate (BER) performance of SC and MC schemes through Monte Carlo simulations. A few trellis-coded modulation (TCM) and low-density parity-check (LDPC)-coded schemes are considered. The obtained SNR loss in the BER curves between the AWGN and impulse noise channels matches well with the corresponding IR gap.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4768558/04768585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.0901.060440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768558","startPage":"171","endPage":"182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental performance limits of communications systems impaired by impulse noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental performance limits of communications systems impaired by impulse noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10429024","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4768585/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental performance limits of communications systems impaired by impulse noise","sourcePdf":"0171-tc0901-pighi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09764S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4768558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4768558","articleId":"4768585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4768586,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Kuchi","affiliation":["University of Technology, Arlington, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4768558/4768586/4768586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kiran Kuchi was born in Nellore, India, in 1974.

In the proposed implementation, the existing correlations between the real (I) and imaginary (Q) parts of the complex-valued baseband received signal are exploited using a widely linear (WL) maximum likelihood (ML) receiver. Several bounds and approximations are developed to analyze the average symbol error rate (SER) performance, and to analyze the tradeoff between the diversity advantage and interference cancellation (IC) gain in a flat Rayleigh fading channel. Two new results are shown. First, we show that the IC ability of WL receivers is independent of the modulation type used by the desired signal but the gain depends mainly on the modulation type employed by the individual interferers and the total number of antennas.

This brief presents an approach to detect premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) using the neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions (NEWFMs). The NEWFM classifies normal and PVC beats by the trained bounded sum of weighted fuzzy membership functions (BSWFMs) using wavelet transformed coefficients from the MIT-BIH PVC database. The eight generalized coefficients, locally related to the time signal, are extracted by the nonoverlap area distribution measurement method. The eight generalized coefficients are used for the three PVC data sets with reliable accuracy rates of 99.80%, 99.21%, and 98.78%, respectively, which means that the selected features are less dependent on the data sets. It is shown that the locations of the eight features are not only around the QRS complex that represents ventricular depolarization in the electrocardiogram (ECG) containing a Q wave, an R wave, and an S wave, but also the QR segment from the Q wave to the R wave has more discriminate information than the RS segment from the R wave to the S wave. The BSWFMs of the eight features trained by NEWFM are shown visually, which makes the features explicitly interpretable. Since each BSWFM combines multiple weighted fuzzy membership functions into one using the bounded sum, the eight small-sized BSWFMs can realize real-time PVC detection in a mobile environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768621/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10477138","pubMedId":"19179246","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4768621/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Finding Features for Real-Time Premature Ventricular Contraction Detection Using a Fuzzy Neural Network System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding Features for Real-Time Premature Ventricular Contraction Detection Using a Fuzzy Neural Network System","sourcePdf":"tnn-lim-2012031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083273S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4787641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4787641","articleId":"4768621","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4768623,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yi","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Department of Computer, College of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4787641/4768623/4768623-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Yi was born in Yangzhou, China, in 1980.

The system considered is general and non-Gaussian and the tracking objective is the statistical information of a given target probability density function (pdf), rather than a deterministic signal. The control aims at making the statistical information of the output pdfs to follow those of a target pdf. For such a control framework, a variable structure adaptive tracking control strategy is first established using two-step neural network models. Following the B-spline neural network approximation to the integrated performance function, the concerned problem is transferred into the tracking of given weights. The dynamic neural network (DNN) is employed to identify the unknown nonlinear dynamics between the control input and the weights related to the integrated function. To achieve the required control objective, an adaptive controller based on the proposed DNN is developed so as to track a reference trajectory. Stability analysis for both the identification and tracking errors is developed via the use of Lyapunov stability criterion.

The NN architecture consists of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with two inputs, three neurons in the hidden layer, and one output. Depending on the application, the NN output has to resolve the ambiguity due to phase-shift measurement by linearizing the inverse of the square law, or to indicate an output voltage corresponding to the tested surface. This embedded system dedicated to optoelectronic measurements was successfully tested with an analog NN, implemented in 0.35-mu m complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, resulting in a threefold increase in the distance range with respect to the one limited by the phase-shift measurement, and by discriminating four types of surfaces (a plastic surface, glossy paper, a painted wall, and a porous surface), at a remote distance between the range finder and the target varying from 0.5 m up to 1.25 m and with a laser beam angle varying between -pi/6 and pi/6 with respect to the target. In this type of application, NN analog implementation provides many advantages, notably use of a small silicon area, low power consumption and no analog-to-digital conversions (ADCs). Nevertheless, digital implementation allows ease of conception and reconfigurability and an embedded weight and bias update. This paper presents the complete measurement system and a comparison between both types of implementation, by developing the advantages and drawbacks relative to each method. An optimized mixed architecture, using both techniques, is then proposed and discussed at the end of the paper.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2009120","startPage":"460","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2009120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4787641","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4787641/04768633.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison Between Analog and Digital Neural Network Implementations for Range-Finding Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768633/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison Between Analog and Digital Neural Network Implementations for Range-Finding Applications","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4768633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10477140","pubMedId":"19179247","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison Between Analog and Digital Neural Network Implementations for Range-Finding Applications","sourcePdf":"tnn-lgatet-2009120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19916S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4787641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4787641","articleId":"4768633","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4768634,"authors":[{"name":"Namik Kemal Yilmaz","affiliation":["Tigres Limited Company, Turgutlu, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4769672/4768634/4768634-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Namik Kemal Yilmaz received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1998 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Mechanical Engineering Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","His research interest are in path planning, optimization, design, and controls."]},"firstName":"Namik Kemal","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"38129254800"},{"name":"Constantinos Evangelinos","affiliation":["Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4769672/4768634/4768634-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Constantinos Evangelinos received the B.A. degree (with honors) in mathematics from Cambridge University, Cambridge, U.K., in 1993 and the Sc.M. and Ph.D. degrees in applied mathematics from Brown University, Providence, RI, in 1994 and 1999, respectively.","Currently, he is a Research Scientist in the Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, where he works on ocean state estimation.

Quantitatively, what is most useful is defined by an objective function and the goal is then to optimize this objective under the constraints of the available observing network. Examples of objectives are better oceanic understanding, to improve forecast quality, or to sample regions of high interest. This work provides a new path-planning scheme for the adaptive sampling problem. We define the path-planning problem in terms of an optimization framework and propose a method based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The mathematical goal is to find the vehicle path that maximizes the line integral of the uncertainty of field estimates along this path. Sampling this path can improve the accuracy of the field estimates the most. While achieving this objective, several constraints must be satisfied and are implemented. They relate to vehicle motion, intervehicle coordination, communication, collision avoidance, etc. The MILP formulation is quite powerful to handle different problem constraints and flexible enough to allow easy extensions of the problem. The formulation covers single- and multiple-vehicle cases as well as single- and multiple-day formulations. The need for a multiple-day formulation arises when the ocean sampling mission is optimized for several days ahead. We first introduce the details of the formulation, then elaborate on the objective function and constraints, and finally, present a varied set of examples to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4769672/04768634.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2008.2002105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2008.2002105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path Planning of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles for Adaptive Sampling Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Underwater vehicles","Sampling methods","Mixed integer linear programming","Oceans","Sea measurements","Constraint optimization","Optimization methods","Uncertainty","Collision avoidance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","path planning","remotely operated vehicles","sampling methods","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","autonomous underwater vehicle","adaptive sampling","mixed integer linear programming","ocean measurement","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive sampling","Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN)","autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)","data assimilation","error subspace","mixed integer linear programming (MILP)","Monterey Bay","ocean modeling","ocean observing system","path planning","routing","trajectory planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Path Planning of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles for Adaptive Sampling Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming","volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4768634/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10471662","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path Planning of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles for Adaptive Sampling Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"joe-plermusiaux-2002105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095622S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4769672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"4769672","articleId":"4768634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4768655,"authors":[{"name":"William Enck","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["William Enck is a PhD candidate in the Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security (SIIS) Laboratory in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Pennsylvania State University.

In this paper, two types of relay networks are considered-one with no channel state information (CSI) (i.e., the noncoherent networks) and one with only the information of the relay-to-destination channels (i.e., the partially coherent networks) at the destination. First, a new optimal power-allocation (PA) scheme is derived to maximize the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination while minimizing the amount of fading experienced over the network. Second, the Fourier-based unitary space-time modulation (USTM), which was originally proposed for multiple colocated transmit antennas, is applied to wireless relay networks. The receivers for such distributed USTM over noncoherent and partially coherent networks are developed, and their error performances are shown to be asymptotically the same. The impact of different PA schemes on the error performance of distributed USTM is thoroughly illustrated with simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transmitting antennas","Antenna arrays","Protocols","Channel state information","Fading","Wireless networks","Councils","Detectors","Strontium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","modulation","multifrequency antennas","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error performance","distributed unitary space-time modulation","wireless relay networks","source signals","channel state information","noncoherent network","relay-to- destination channels","partially coherent network","optimal power-allocation scheme","signal-to-noise ratio","Fourier-based unitary space-time modulation","multiple colocated transmit antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amount of fading","distributed space\u2013time coding (DSTC)","power allocation (PA)","unitary space\u2013time modulation (USTM)","wireless relay networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2013631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04768674.pdf","startPage":"3333","endPage":"3346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2013631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation and Error Performance of Distributed Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation in Wireless Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation and Error Performance of Distributed Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation in Wireless Relay Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768674/","volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4768674/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10829109","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation and Error Performance of Distributed Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation in Wireless Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-nguyen-2013631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154808S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4768674","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4768675,"authors":[{"name":"Taehun An","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5204505/4768675/4768675-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taehun An (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering in 2006 from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, and the M.S.E. degree in electrical engineering in 2008 from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Since March 2006, he has been a Teaching and Research Assistant with the Division of Electrical Engineering, KAIST.

The proposed joint source and channel coding scheme is capable of operating at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in Rayleigh fading channels contaminated by partial-band noise jamming (PBNJ). The IrVLC scheme is composed of a number of component variable-length coding (VLC) codebooks employing different coding rates that encode particular fractions of the input source symbol stream. These fractions may be chosen with the aid of EXIT charts to shape the inverted EXIT curve of the IrVLC codec so that it can be matched with the EXIT curve of the inner decoder.

Detailed analysis of the WF capability curve is carried out considering maximum hourly variation of wind power from the forecasted value. Different cost components are identified, and subsequently, a generalized reactive power cost model is developed for wind turbine generators that can help the independent system operator (ISO) in managing the system and the grid efficiently. Apart from the fixed cost and the cost of loss components, a new method is proposed to calculate the opportunity cost component for a WF considering hourly wind variations. The Cigre 32-bus test system is used to demonstrate a case study showing the implementation of the developed model in short-term system operations. A finding is that higher wind speed prediction errors (a site with high degree of wind fluctuations) may lead to increased payments to the WFs for this service, mainly due to the increased lost opportunity cost (LOC) component. In a demonstrated case, it is found that 2340 $/h is paid to the WF as the LOC payment only, when the wind prediction error is 0.5 per unit (p.u.), whereas 54 $/h is the expected total payment to the WF when the prediction error is 0.2 p.u. for its reactive power service.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4768680/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846917","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wind Farms as Reactive Power Ancillary Service Providers\u2014Technical and Economic Issues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind Farms as Reactive Power Ancillary Service Providers\u2014Technical and Economic Issues","sourcePdf":"tec-ullah-2008957.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081744S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5224009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"5224009","articleId":"4768680","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4768681,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Indiveri","affiliation":["Dipartimento Ingegneria Innovazione, University of Salerno, Lecce, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Indiveri","id":"37285395400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"4768681","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1891},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768681","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Wheels","Robot sensing systems","Motion control","Vehicles","Robot kinematics","Design engineering","Buildings","Trajectory","Actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","mobile robots","motion control","robot kinematics","wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Swedish wheeled omnidirectional mobile robots:","kinematics analysis","control","wheeled robots","mobility","singularities","motion control","Swedish wheels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile robot kinematics","mobile robots","motion control","wheeled robots"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.2010360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4773132/04768681.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.2010360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Swedish Wheeled Omnidirectional Mobile Robots: Kinematics Analysis and Control","abstract":"Swedish wheeled robots have received growing attention over the last few years.

However, all of them consider the consensus reaching process a rigid or inflexible one because its behavior remains fixed in all rounds of the consensus process. The aim of this paper is to improve the consensus reaching process in GDM problems defined in multigranular linguistic contexts, i.e., by using linguistic term sets with different cardinality to represent experts' preferences. To do that, we propose an adaptive consensus support system model for this type of decision-making problem, i.e., a process that adapts its behavior to the agreement achieved in each round. This adaptive model increases the convergence toward the consensus and, therefore, reduces the number of rounds to reach it.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2013457","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4808359/04768682.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2013457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"279","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Consensus Support Model for Group Decision-Making Problems in a Multigranular Fuzzy Linguistic Context","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Consensus Support Model for Group Decision-Making Problems in a Multigranular Fuzzy Linguistic Context","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768682/","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4768682/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10547349","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Consensus Support Model for Group Decision-Making Problems in a Multigranular Fuzzy Linguistic Context","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-herrera-viedma-2013457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.29999S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4808359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"264","xplore-issue":"4808359","articleId":"4768682","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4768697,"authors":[{"name":"Maur\u00cdcio Aredes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4812316/4768697/4768697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maur\u00edcio Aredes (S\u201994\u2013M\u201997) was born in Monte Apraz\u00edvel, Brazil, on August 14, 1961.

On the other hand, when the goal is to compensate zero-sequence current, the need of energy storage elements in the active filter is discussed. In this case, if zero-sequence components are present simultaneously in the system voltage and load current, they produce zero-sequence power flow, and the control methods based on both theories must contain additional calculations to allow the elimination of energy storage elements in the active filter.

The walking surface is assumed to be rigid and flat; the contact between the robot and the walking surface is assumed to inhibit yaw rotation. The studied robot has 8 DOF in the single support phase and six actuators. In addition to the reduced number of actuators, the interest of studying robots with point feet is that the feedback control solution must explicitly account for the robot's natural dynamics in order to achieve balance while walking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics (HZD), a very successful method for planar bipeds, in order to simultaneously compute a periodic orbit and an autonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit, for a 3-D (spatial) bipedal walking robot. This method allows the computations for the controller design and the periodic orbit to be carried out on a 2-DOF subsystem of the 8-DOF robot model. The stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with the linearization of the restricted Poincare map of the HZD. Most periodic walking gaits for this robot are unstable when the controlled outputs are selected to be the actuated coordinates. Three strategies are explored to produce stable walking. The first strategy consists of imposing a stability condition during the search of a periodic gait by optimization. The second strategy uses an event-based controller to modify the eigenvalues of the (linearized) Poincare map. In the third approach, the effect of output selection on the zero dynamics is discussed and a pertinent choice of outputs is proposed, leading to stabilization without the use of a supplemental event-based controller.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.2010366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4773132/04768702.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.2010366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773132","startPage":"37","endPage":"50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotically Stable Walking of a Five-Link Underactuated 3-D Bipedal Robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotically Stable Walking of a Five-Link Underactuated 3-D Bipedal Robot","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470508","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4768702/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotically Stable Walking of a Five-Link Underactuated 3-D Bipedal Robot","sourcePdf":"tro-grizzle-2010366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075323S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4773132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4773132","articleId":"4768702","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4768706,"authors":[{"name":"Mattia Marconcini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Mattia","lastName":"Marconcini","id":"37269930200"},{"name":"Gustavo Camps-Valls","affiliation":["Escola T\u00e9cnica Superior d Enginyeria, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Camps-Valls","id":"38274160900"},{"name":"Lorenzo Bruzzone","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Bruzzone","id":"37274827100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4768706","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":720},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Hyperspectral imaging","Hyperspectral sensors","Kernel","Image classification","Remote sensing","Training data","Computer science education","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","image classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite semisupervised support vector machine","supervised SVM","spectral-spatial classification","hyperspectral images","unlabeled data","composite kernel functions","single kernels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Composite kernels","kernel methods","remote-sensing hyperspectral image classification","semisupervised classification","support vector machines (SVMs)"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a novel composite semisupervised support vector machine (SVM) for the spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral images.

Past studies have demonstrated the use of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to map rice areas. The methods were based on the temporal change of intensity backscattering coefficient of vertically or horizontally co-polarized data (VV or HH). In this paper, we assess the use of the HH/VV polarization ratio derived from Advanced SAR (ASAR) data from ENVISAT data for the production of rice paddy maps. The approach is based on past knowledge on the polarization behavior of rice canopy, i.e., VV backscattering is much lower than HH during a large part of the rice season, due to the attenuation of the wave by the vertical structure of the plants. The methodology is developed for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, where a complex cropping pattern is found (one to three crops of rice per year). The approach includes a statistical analysis of the HH/VV distributions of rice and non-rice classes at different dates. The analysis results confirm that HH/VV can be used as classifier and point out the need for relevant speckle filtering prior to classification. A classification method is developed and applied to single- and multidate data sets. The methods are tested at one district of the province of An Giang and extended to the whole province. Comparisons of the mapping results to geographic-information-system land-use data and official agricultural statistics show very good agreement. The method will be further applied to the entire Mekong Delta.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4768722/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470388","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring of the Rice Cropping System in the Mekong Delta Using ENVISAT/ASAR Dual Polarization Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring of the Rice Cropping System in the Mekong Delta Using ENVISAT/ASAR Dual Polarization Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bouvet-2007963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083738S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4773457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"4773457","articleId":"4768722","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4768724,"authors":[{"name":"Navin Srivastava","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5165202/4768724/4768724-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Navin Srivastava (S\u201903) received the B.Tech.

A detailed analysis of SWCNT interconnect resistance (considering its dependence on all physical parameters, as well as factors affecting the contact resistance), the first full 3-D capacitance simulations of SWCNT bundles for realistic very large scale integration (VLSI) interconnect dimensions, and a quantitative evaluation of the importance of inductive effects in SWCNT interconnects are presented. The applicability of carbon nanotube (CNT) based vias (vertical interconnects)-the most realizable CNT interconnects in the current state of the art-is addressed for the first time. It is shown that CNT interconnects can provide 30%-40% improvement in the delay of millimeter-long global interconnects. The applicability of CNT monolayers as local interconnects is found to be much more limited than that reported in the prior literature. Dense CNT bundle global interconnects are shown to offer a 4times reduction in power dissipation while achieving the same delay as optimally buffered Cu interconnects at the 22 nm node. This power saving increases to 8times at the 14 nm node. Furthermore, 3-D finite-element electrothermal simulations show that CNT bundles used as vias in between Cu metal layers can provide large improvement in metal interconnect lifetime by lowering the temperature of the hottest interconnects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Applicability of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes as VLSI Interconnects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2009.2013945","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5165202/04768724.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2013945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Applicability of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes as VLSI Interconnects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4768724/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10764125","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Applicability of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes as VLSI Interconnects","sourcePdf":"tnano-banerjee-2013945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171058S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5165202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"5165202","articleId":"4768724","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4768725,"authors":[{"name":"Guilherme V.

To achieve the desired performance during high-speed driving, the controller architecture considers both the kinematic and the dynamic control in a cascade structure. Our study contains a comparative study between two kinematic linear predictive control strategies: The first strategy is based on the successive linearization concept, and the other strategy combines a local reference frame with an approaching path strategy. Our goal is to search for the strategy that best comprises the performance and hardware-cost criteria. For the dynamic controller, a decentralized predictive controller based on a linearized model of the vehicle is used. Practical experiments obtained using an autonomous ldquoMini-Bajardquo vehicle equipped with an embedded computing system are presented. These results confirm that the proposed MPC structure is the solution that better matches the target criteria.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10501756","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4768725/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Predictive Controller for Autonomous Vehicle Path Tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Predictive Controller for Autonomous Vehicle Path Tracking","sourcePdf":"tits-raffo-2011697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078187S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4796392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"4796392","articleId":"4768725","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4768730,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Qin Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4786573/4768730/4768730-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Qin Wang (M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2005.

It appears that the novel combination of millimeter-wave frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) technology and SAR techniques can provide an optimal solution. However, some efficient techniques should be applied to resolve range/Doppler ambiguities in FMCW UAV SAR systems. As such, a technique of waveform-diversity-based millimeter-wave UAV SAR imaging is presented in this paper. Along with the described system concept and signal model, the performance of the diversified waveforms evaluated by their cross correlations is detailed. As the conventional stop-and-go approximation is not valid for FMCW SAR, a modified wavenumber-domain algorithm with a consideration of continuous antenna motion during transmission and reception is derived. This imaging algorithm is validated with computer simulations. Furthermore, one parallel direct-digital-synthesizer-driven phase-locked-loop synthesizer with adaptive nonlinearity compensation, which has been validated by the experimental results, is proposed to obtain a millimeter-wave FMCW signal with fine frequency linearity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4786573/04768730.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2008720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2008720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4786573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform-Diversity-Based Millimeter-Wave UAV SAR Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Remote sensing","Millimeter wave technology","Millimeter wave radar","Synthetic aperture radar","Energy consumption","Frequency","Signal resolution","Radar polarimetry","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","millimetre waves","remote sensing by radar","remotely operated vehicles","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","SAR","remote sensing","unmanned airborne vehicle","UAV","power consumption","frequency-modulated continuous-wave","FMCW technology","Doppler ambiguity","waveform-diversity-based millimeter-wave","imaging algorithm","adaptive nonlinearity compensation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar","millimeter-wave synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV)","waveform diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Waveform-Diversity-Based Millimeter-Wave UAV SAR Remote Sensing","volume":"47","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4768730/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10498831","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform-Diversity-Based Millimeter-Wave UAV SAR Remote Sensing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wang-2008720.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068757S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4786573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4786573","articleId":"4768730","onlineDate":"27 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4768741,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Mohanty","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Mohanty","id":"38186345100"},{"name":"Susmita Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Das","id":"37404265900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3825-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2747-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3825-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"4768741","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse shaping methods","OFDM","Interference","Fading","Bit error rate","Digital video broadcasting","Wireless LAN","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia systems","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","pulse shaping","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse shaping functions","ICI power reduction","intercarrier interference","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing communication system","mobile radio channels"]}],"abstract":"For orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems, the frequency offsets in mobile radio channels distort the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting in intercarrier interference (ICI).

In this paper, we present analytical expressions for bit error rate (BER) of pi/4-DQPSK modulation with L-branch selection combining (SC) diversity in Nakagami-m fading channels perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The derived end expressions are in closed form and contain finite series of Gaussian hypergeometric function. This makes evaluation of error rates much straightforward compared to earlier approaches that required single or, even double numerical integration. Some special instances such as the non-diversity case and Rayleigh fading case are also investigated and plotted alongwith the main findings. The results are however limited to integer values of fading severity parameter m.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual IEEE India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753724/4768733/04768742.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual IEEE India Conference","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2008.4768742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2008.4768742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of selection combining for differentially detected \u03c0/4-DQPSK in Nakagami-m fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Fading","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","AWGN","Rayleigh channels","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Phase modulation","Digital modulation","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","cellular radio","Nakagami channels","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["selection analysis","Nakagami-m fading channels","differential quadrature phase shift keying","code division multiple access","digital cellular systems","selection combining diversity","additive white Gaussian noise","Gaussian hypergeometric function","nondiversity case","Rayleigh fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BER","Nakagami-m","selection combining","DQPSK"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of selection combining for differentially detected \u03c0/4-DQPSK in Nakagami-m fading channels","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4768742/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10469569","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of selection combining for differentially detected \u03c0/4-DQPSK in Nakagami-m fading channels","confLoc":"Kanpur, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062981S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753724","isNumber":"4768733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753724","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4768733","articleId":"4768742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4768745,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Due to the asymmetry present in occurrence of sags, dealing with unbalanced voltage sag is more complicated. Along with the reduction in voltage magnitude, if phase-jump is accompanied in unbalanced voltage sag, it further complicates the compensation. Power electronic converter loads get seriously deteriorated due to the unbalance present either in magnitude or in phase-angle relationship present between all three phases. Apart from restoring magnitude of the load voltage to the required level, care has to be taken so that balance is maintained in the three phase network. But, taking into consideration the maximum voltage injection constraint of the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), voltage injection has to be done in an efficient manner so as to find out the best scheme of DVR voltage injection. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to find out the optimum configuration for various unbalanced voltage sags with phase-jumps.

The variation in soft handoff coverage area can be taken as the parameter influencing the performance parameters of the CDMA cellular system. In this paper, an analytical model is developed and analyzed for the concerned target cell in CDMA cellular network. The model proposed in this paper is for Bi-class services mainly integrated data and voice. It is based on priority reservation for handoff voice and data calls along with call queuing scheme for handoff data calls. Upper channel limits are set for new voice as well as data calls to give priority to handoff calls. Two dimensional Markov birth-death process is used for modeling the problem. The data handoff queue capacity is considered as function of soft handoff coverage area which depends on the two soft handoff threshold parameters T_ADD and T_DROP. Variation in these threshold parameters is stated in term of variation in handoff data call queue capacity. The performance parameters of the model mainly new voice and data call blocking probabilities and handoff voice and data dropping probabilities are analyzed for variation in upper channel limit for new voice call and handoff data call queue capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual IEEE India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753724/4768787/04768824.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual IEEE India Conference","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2008.4768824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2008.4768824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Bi-class call admission control scheme in CDMA cellular network for variation in soft handoff threshold parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Call admission control","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Traffic control","Speech analysis","Quality of service","Delay effects","Communication system traffic control","Video on demand","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","integrated voice/data communication","Markov processes","queueing theory","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bi-class call admission control scheme","CDMA cellular network","soft handoff threshold parameters","cell capacity","concerned target cell","integrated data and voice","handoff voice calls","handoff data calls","two dimensional Markov birth-death process","data handoff queue capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code Division Multi-access (CDMA)","T_ADD","T_DROP","Call admission control","Queuing","Soft handoff","Markov chain modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Bi-class call admission control scheme in CDMA cellular network for variation in soft handoff threshold parameters","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4768824/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459837","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Bi-class call admission control scheme in CDMA cellular network for variation in soft handoff threshold parameters","confLoc":"Kanpur, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040356S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753724","isNumber":"4768787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753724","xplore-issue":"4768787","articleId":"4768824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4768825,"authors":[{"name":"Dipta Das","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engg, Dr. B.

The quality and reliability of power needs to be maintained for obtaining optimum performance. Now-a-days power has also become a business commodity. Hence, faultless and lossless transmission and distribution of power is necessary. Power faults must be identified quickly from various sources (eg. information from relays etc.) and corrected as soon as possible. Advanced signal processing tools such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can be used very effectively for parameterization and characterization of the fault signals. On the other hand, properly configured neural network (NN) can be utilized for classification of the faults based on the DWT signal. Presently Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) is used for simulation of a model transmission system and DWT and NN is performed using MATLAB.

The derived model has a nonlinear structure. Using the previous results of the physical modeling of the studied plant, a nonlinear model is considered based on the physical dynamics of the system. However, there is no need to perform numerous physical experiments to estimate the model parameters. Instead, genetic algorithm as a nonlinear optimization technique is used to obtain the parameters of the model. Therefore, the advantage of both modeling and identification methods are employed. In the next step, the parameters of a multi input-multi output (MIMO) PID controller for the derived model will be tuned by GA using the obtained nonlinear model as a simulator of the plant.

However, due to parameter variations in scaled technologies, stable operation of SRAMs is critical for the success of low-voltage SRAMs. It has been shown that conventional 6T SRAMs fail to achieve reliable subthreshold operation. Hence, researchers have considered different configuration SRAMs for subthreshold operations having single-ended 8T or 10T bit-cells for improved stability. While these bit-cells improve SRAM stability in subthreshold region significantly, the single-ended sensing methods suffer from reduced bit-line swing due to bit-line leakage noise. In addition, efficient bit-interleaving in column may not be possible and hence, the multiple-bit soft errors can be a real issue. In this paper, we propose a differential 10T bit-cell that effectively separates read and write operations, thereby achieving high cell stability. The proposed bit-cell also provides efficient bit-interleaving structure to achieve soft-error tolerance with conventional Error Correcting Codes (ECC). For read access, we employ dynamic DCVSL scheme to compensate bitline leakage noise, thereby improving bitline swing. To verify the proposed techniques, a 32 kb array of the proposed 10T bit-cell is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology. The hardware measurement results demonstrate that this bit-cell array successfully operates down to 160 mV. For leakage power comparison, we also fabricated 49 kb arrays of the 6T and the proposed 10T bit-cells. Measurement results show that the leakage power of the proposed bit-cell is close to that of the 6T (between 0.96x and 1.22x of 6T).","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2011972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2011972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4768865/04768883.pdf","startPage":"650","endPage":"658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 32 kb 10T Sub-Threshold SRAM Array With Bit-Interleaving and Differential Read Scheme in 90 nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 32 kb 10T Sub-Threshold SRAM Array With Bit-Interleaving and Differential Read Scheme in 90 nm CMOS","volume":"44","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4768883/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10416944","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768883/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 32 kb 10T Sub-Threshold SRAM Array With Bit-Interleaving and Differential Read Scheme in 90 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"44jssc02-ichang-2011972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062607S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4768865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"293","xplore-issue":"4768865","articleId":"4768883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4768888,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth A.

To mitigate that effect, we propose a modified switched-capacitor (SC) feedback DAC technique, with a variable switched series resistor (SR). The architecture has the additional benefit of reducing the typically high SC DAC output peak currents, resulting in reduced slew-rate requirements for the loop-filter integrators. A theoretical investigation is carried out which provides new insight into the synthesis of switched-capacitor with switched series resistor (SCSR) DACs with a specified reduction of the pulse-width jitter sensitivity and minimal power consumption and complexity. To demonstrate the concept and to verify the reduced pulse-width jitter sensitivity a 5 mW, 312 MHz, second order, low-pass, 1-bit, CT DeltaSigma modulator with SCSR feedback was implemented in a 1.2 V, 90 nm, RF-CMOS process.

The architecture offers subthreshold operation for the entire module, except for the selected segments. In addition, a new operational mode for the SRAM cell is introduced which allows only the bitlines of the selected columns to be discharged in an operation. The stability of the cells is enhanced in both read and write operation by controlling the cell access time and cell supply voltage, respectively. A 2048 times 20 bit eSRAM unit is implemented in a regular 0.13 mum CMOS technology to confirm the idea. The unit operates at 100 MHz and consumes less than 1 mW in both read and write operations. Thanks to the reverse body bias of the transistors, the leakage current of a 0.4 V cell drops to 27 pA during the non-access time. The measurement results shows a 28% noise margin enhancement for this scheme when a subthreshold cell is accessed.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2010815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4768865/04768891.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2010815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy Efficient 40 Kb SRAM Module With Extended Read/Write Noise Margin in 0.13 -m CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Energy Efficient 40 Kb SRAM Module With Extended Read/Write Noise Margin in 0.13 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>m CMOS","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10416950","htmlLink":"/document/4768891/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy Efficient 40 Kb SRAM Module With Extended Read/Write Noise Margin in 0.13 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>m CMOS","sourcePdf":"44jssc02-msharifkhani-2010815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074721S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4768865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4768865","articleId":"4768891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4768892,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sharifkhani","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4768865/4768892/4768892-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Sharifkhani (S'98\u2013M'07) received the B.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

The proposed definition of the dynamic data stability criteria introduces a new bound for the cell static noise margin (SNM). It reveals that the true noise margin of the cell can be made considerably higher than the conventional SNM once the cell access time is sufficiently shorter than the cell time-constant. This phenomena can be used to extend the noise margin in (partial) subthreshold SRAMs. Moreover, a simulation method for verification of the dynamic data stability criteria is presented. Silicon measurement results in 130 nm CMOS technology confirms the concept of dynamic data stability and designer's ability to trade timing and static parameters . Finally, it is shown that the long time constant due to the subthreshold operation of the cell can be exploited to maintain data stability with proper choice of access and recovery time.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2010818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4768865/04768892.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2010818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM Cell Stability: A Dynamic Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"SRAM Cell Stability: A Dynamic Perspective","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10416951","htmlLink":"/document/4768892/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM Cell Stability: A Dynamic Perspective","sourcePdf":"44jssc02-msharifkhani-2010818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085832S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4768865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4768865","articleId":"4768892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4768894,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuo Sasaki","affiliation":["Research Institute of Nanodevice and Bio Systems, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4768865/4768894/4768894-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nobuo Sasaki received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in physics from Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan, in 1995, 1997, and 2001, respectively.","Since 2001, he has been with the Research Institute for Nanodevice and Bio Systems (RNBS) at Hiroshima University.

Fundamental frequency impedance approximation is used to analyze the resistance of rectifying diodes; parasitic resistive loss components are also included in the analysis of rectifier input resistance. The closed form equation shows insights into design parameter tradeoffs, such as power available from the antenna, antenna radiation resistance, the number of diodes, DC load current, parasitic resistive loss components, diode and capacitor sizes, and frequency of operation. Therefore, it enables the optimization of rectifier parameters for impedance matching with a low-cost printed antenna and shunt tuning inductor, in order to improve the RF to DC conversion efficiency and the operational distance of UHF RFID transponders.

His work on high-performance logic-based eDRAM includes pioneering effort and analysis to demonstrate the value and feasibility of logic-based embedded DRAM for system products. Initially upon joining IBM, he worked on NMOS device characterization and circuit design for logic and memory. This work was part of the effort that led to IBM's NMOS technology for main memory. He was also involved in the application of semiconductor technology to communication systems. During the early 1970s, he did extensive work that demonstrated the leverage of word and bit line redundancy for semiconductor memory yield. His work on redundancy included the development of laser personalization techniques for integrated circuits. This technique was also used to achieve fast turnaround times in the personalization of PLAs. In the late 1970s, he started a research effort on the design and application of a series of NMOS and CMOS memory chips for very high-speed operation. This work included the design of very high-speed CMOS ECL-compatible SRAMs with cycle time less than access time.

Unique features of the hierarchical sense amplifier include its short local bit lines and a local half sense amplifier p device latch that is connected by a switch to a global half sense amplifier device latch. When the local and global half latches are connected by the switch, they form a conventional cross-coupled latch. As a result of the short bit lines, the magnitude of the differential signal is large enough to overcome device variations in the various pairs of like-devices of the sense amplifier. The differential sense amplifier is quite insensitive to absolute parameter variation and mainly sensitive to mismatches between paired devices. The hierarchical differential sense amplifier has very low static power due to the use of a sense voltage of approximately Vdd/2 which causes low leakage in the local and global sense amplifiers as well as in the storage cell. Low active power also results from this Vdd/2 sensing. In addition, simulation results show low latency, fast restore, and fast cycle time with clocking and timing that are relatively simple.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2010811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2010811","startPage":"631","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4768865/04768898.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Low Power eDRAM Hierarchical Differential Sense Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast Low Power eDRAM Hierarchical Differential Sense Amplifier","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10416953","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4768898/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Low Power eDRAM Hierarchical Differential Sense Amplifier","sourcePdf":"44jssc02-rmatick-2010811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049436S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4768865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4768865","articleId":"4768898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4768904,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal V.

It exploits the 6-to-10 GHz band to generate short duration bi-phase modulated UWB pulses with a center frequency of 8 GHz. No additional RF filtering circuits are required since the pulse generator circuit itself has the functionality of pulse shaping. Generated pulses comply with the FCC spectral emission mask. Measured results show that the transmitter consumes 12 pJ/b to achieve a maximum pulse repetition rate of 750 Mb/s.

While passive decaps can provide a certain degree of protection against IR drop, if a problem is found after the physical design is completed, it is difficult to implement a quick fix to the problem. In this paper, we investigate the use of an active decap as a drop-in replacement for passive decaps to provide noise reduction for these so-called ldquohot-spotrdquo IR drop problems found late in the design process. A modified active decap design is proposed for ASIC applications operating up to 1 GHz. Our improvement uses latch-based comparators as the sensing circuit, which provides a better power/delay tradeoff than previous designs and incorporates hysteresis to minimize unnecessary switching. It is implemented in a 1 V-core 90 nm CMOS process with a total area of 0.085 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and static power of 2.8 mW. Measurements from a number of test chips show that using an active decap can provide between 10%-20% noise reduction in the 200 MHz-1 GHz frequency range over its passive counterpart. Sizing and placement analyses are also carried out using circuit simulation. The active decap is most effective when placed in close proximity to the hot-spot, as compared to the passive decap which is less sensitive to the exact location. Overall, if sized and placed properly, active decaps can provide an additional 20% reduction in supply noise over passive decaps.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4768865/04768908.pdf","startPage":"584","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2010752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2010752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4768865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4768908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Active Decoupling Capacitor for \u201cHot-Spot\u201d Supply Noise Reduction in ASIC Designs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Noise reduction","Application specific integrated circuits","Power supplies","Protection","Process design","Delay","Hysteresis","Switching circuits","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits","power supply circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active decoupling capacitor","hot-spot","supply noise reduction","ASIC","power supply noise","IR drop","latch-based comparators","CMOS process","circuit simulation","voltage 1 V","size 90 nm","power 2.8 mW","frequency 200 MHz to 1 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MOS integrated circuits","decoupling capacitors","comparators","power supply noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Active Decoupling Capacitor for \u201cHot-Spot\u201d Supply Noise Reduction in ASIC Designs","volume":"44","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4768908/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10416956","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Active Decoupling Capacitor for \u201cHot-Spot\u201d Supply Noise Reduction in ASIC Designs","sourcePdf":"44jssc02-xmeng-2010752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065895S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4768865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4768865","articleId":"4768908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4768910,"authors":[{"name":"Youngcheol Chae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4768865/4768910/4768910-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youngcheol Chae (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in the department of electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

A high diversity gain can therefore be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4768932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470435","htmlLink":"/document/4768932/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A compact MIMO antenna for wireless communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact MIMO antenna for wireless communication","sourcePdf":"502008-Tm-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029927S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4762427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4762427","articleId":"4768932","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4769003,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Ghandar","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/4769002/4769003/4769003-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adam Ghandar received the Degree in computer science (mathematics) (First Class Honors) from the University of New England, Armidale, Australia.

Second, cross-layer interactions are explicitly supported by extending the definition of a service to include control interfaces that can be tuned externally so as to modify the behavior of the service. The third principle is ldquodesign for change:ldquo the architecture does not dictate the services to be implemented, but provides mechanisms to introduce new services and compose them to perform specific communication tasks. In this paper, we provide an update on the current status of the architecture and the prototype software implementation.

In such systems mapping is the process of allocating resources and representing them is the mapping overhead. Existing mapping algorithms require an allocation descriptor to be broadcast in each frame for each allocated resource for every served subscriber. Information concerning the allocations is crucial for proper system operation, therefore it is broadcast on the wireless down link with low modulation and high repetition rate. The mapping overhead which is a function of the number of served subscribers is usually large and consumes a substantial part of down link resources. We present the notion of semi fixed allocations that allows a substantial reduction of the mapping overhead. We show that by taking advantage of the periodicity of VoIP frames and by applying semi fixed allocations in the existing resource allocation process, the mapping overhead can be reduced substantially. We present an innovative system model for the problem on hand and for evaluating the solutions. Using this model we show that the problem is in NP hard and present a set of observations on the resource allocation process leading to good mapping decisions from the perspective of mapping overhead. We present new mapping algorithms implementing those mapping decisions and show that by extensive simulations with these mapping algorithms the overhead can be reduced to 10% of the overhead experienced in OFDMA-based systems such as WiMAX and IEEE802.16, while retaining a low computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient mapping of VoIP traffic in wireless OFDMA systems using semi-fixed allocations","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","doi":"10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769072","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753885/4769015/04769072.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient mapping of VoIP traffic in wireless OFDMA systems using semi-fixed allocations","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769072/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10478277","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient mapping of VoIP traffic in wireless OFDMA systems using semi-fixed allocations","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055672S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753885","isNumber":"4769015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753885","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4769015","articleId":"4769072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4769111,"authors":[{"name":"Indu Shakya","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Engineering and Design, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK"],"firstName":"Indu","lastName":"Shakya","id":"37946722900"},{"name":"Falah H.

Optimum detection is based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle. However, ML is impractical due to its computational complexity. On the other hand, linear detection techniques such as Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) exhibit poor performance. Consequently, we explore the combination of MMSE estimation with ML estimation around a neighborhood of the MMSE estimate. We evaluate the performance of the different schemes in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), with reference to the number of FDM carriers and their frequency separation. The combined MMSE-ML scheme achieves a near optimum error performance with polynomial complexity for a small number of BPSK FDM carriers. For QPSK modulation the performance of the proposed system improves for a large number of ML comparisons. In all cases, the detectability of the FDM signal is bounded by the signal dimension and the carriers frequency distance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753885/4769015/04769119.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"425","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","doi":"10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combined MMSE-ML detection for a spectrally efficient non orthogonal FDM signal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency division multiplexing","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","AWGN","Interference","Computational complexity","Mean square error methods","Additive white noise","Polynomials","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","intercarrier interference","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","quadrature phase shift keying","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrally efficient nonorthogonal FDM signal","frequency division multiplexing system","intercarrier interference","MMSE-ML detection","minimum mean square error","maximum likelihood principle","linear detection technique","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","frequency separation","BPSK FDM carrier","binary phase shift keying","QPSK modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","carrier frequency distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A combined MMSE-ML detection for a spectrally efficient non orthogonal FDM signal","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769119/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470105","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combined MMSE-ML detection for a spectrally efficient non orthogonal FDM signal","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0468S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753885","isNumber":"4769015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753885","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4769015","articleId":"4769119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4769120,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

The proposed technique utilizes OFDM to transform frequency selective fading channels into multiple flat fading sub-channels on which space-frequency coding is applied. A four-branch transmitter diversity system is implemented without bandwidth expansion and with only one receive antenna. The associated simulations verify that the four-branch transmitter diversity scheme achieves a significant improvement in average bit-error rate (BER) performance. The proposed scheme also outperforms the previously reported scheme due to Yu, Keroueden, and Yuan with only single phase feedback, and that improvement is retained with quantized feedback. Since the angle feedback is on a per tone basis, the feedback information would be too large for any practical OFDM system. However, we adopt a method which exploits the correlation among the feedback terms for the subcarriers, i.e. a group based quantization technique to reduce the feedback overhead significantly, rendering this scheme attractive to broadband wireless access systems. The performance improvement of convolutionally concatenated space-frequency block coding (CCSBC) schemes is also investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753885/4769015/04769120.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"430","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","doi":"10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-loop extended orthogonal space frequency block coding techniques for OFDM based broadband wireless access systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","OFDM","Feedback","Transmitters","Fading","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Frequency diversity","Bandwidth","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","broadcast channels","fading channels","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","radio access networks","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop extended orthogonal space frequency block coding","OFDM based broadband wireless access systems","simple extended orthogonal space-frequency coded multiple input single output","MISO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM transmitter diversity","wireless communications","frequency selective fading channels","multiple flat fading subchannels","space-frequency coding","four-branch transmitter diversity system","bandwidth expansion","average bit-error rate performance","single phase feedback","quantized feedback","angle feedback","OFDM system","space-frequency block coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Closed-loop (EO-SFBCs)","Phase rotation","array gain","diversity gain","coding gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Closed-loop extended orthogonal space frequency block coding techniques for OFDM based broadband wireless access systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769120/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470106","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-loop extended orthogonal space frequency block coding techniques for OFDM based broadband wireless access systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052104S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753885","isNumber":"4769015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753885","xplore-issue":"4769015","articleId":"4769120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4769121,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The optical community has just started to venture into the application of network coding in optical networks. However, a number of challenges need to be overcome before network coding can be used in optical networks. These include limited buffering and processing capabilities as well as extremely coarse bandwidth granularity. In this paper, we address some of these problems. Finding multicast codes can be broken into two subproblems: finding a subgraph of the topology to code over and then finding an actual code for that subgraph. We show that the former problem is NP-Complete and provide heuristics which allow for coded multicast in optical wavelength division multiplexing networks which offer a modest improvement in bandwidth efficiency over traditional methods for finding routes for optical-layer multicast traffic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769125/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10470109","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769125/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network coding for optical-layer multicast","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network coding for optical-layer multicast","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061231S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753885","isNumber":"4769015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753885","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4769015","articleId":"4769125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4769132,"authors":[{"name":"A.

SC-FDE-MIMO scheme is effective solution with relative low complexity to combat inter -symbol interference (ISI) whilst exploiting multi antennas diversity gain. In our system, the signal to leakage ratio (SLR) criterion is used to design the transmit beamformer and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is employed for the receiver equalization and combining. Non-robust beamforming techniques require perfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge which is not available in practice. In this paper, we propose a robust transmit beamformer which can successfully tolerate CSI imperfection. Diagonal loading is employed to introduce robustness to channel state information errors. The novelty of this work, however, is the application of the robust beamforming in the context of downlink MU-SC transmission.

In the WiMedia standard, the Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) is used as the basic physical scheme. An in-depth Bit Error Rate (BER) performance analysis of the MB-OFDM UWB system using IEEE 802.15.3a channel models is conducted to aid the throughput analysis. The PCA throughput performance analysis is carried out by extending an original Enhanced Distributed Contention Access (EDCA) model for 802.11e into the MB-OFDM UWB protocol. The extended model considers the effects of the bit error rate, the transmission opportunity limits, and the uniqueness of WiMedia MAC timing structure. The results illustrate that the station saturation throughput of the PCA scheme is sensitive to the frame payload length, and there exists an optimal frame payload length that maximizes the saturation throughput. The results also show that the saturation throughput of the Access Category (AC) with higher priority outperforms the lower prioritized AC under all types of BER conditions.","doi":"10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769134","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753885/4769015/04769134.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769015","startPage":"506","endPage":"513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation throughput analysis of Multiband-OFDM ultra wideband networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Saturation throughput analysis of Multiband-OFDM ultra wideband networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769134/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470111","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4769134/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation throughput analysis of Multiband-OFDM ultra wideband networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074871S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753885","isNumber":"4769015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753885","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4769015","articleId":"4769134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4769135,"authors":[{"name":"Shumao Ou","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Electronic Systems, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Shumao","lastName":"Ou","id":"37286408500"},{"name":"Kun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Electronic Systems, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290845600"},{"name":"Marcos P.

In order to better understand the co-existence of both network technologies and to determine whether closer cooperation in the bandwidth provisioning process is advantageous, an access network that utilizes a Gigabit PON (GPON) to backhaul 802.16 network traffic is evaluated. Typical to many network deployments, the equipment is from different manufacturers and has different management and control interfaces. This paper proposes the use of a control bridge that overlooks the operations of both the GPON and 802.16 networks in order to: (1) provide dynamic QoS mapping so as to reduce traffic delivery cost; and (2) to improve overall channel utilization through coordinated dynamic bandwidth allocation. The performance of the converged network under the control of the proposed control bridge is evaluated in terms of cost of data delivery, channel utilization, and service differentiation.","doi":"10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769015","startPage":"514","endPage":"521","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753885/4769015/04769135.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A control bridge to automate the convergence of Passive Optical Networks and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic control","Optical control","Bridges","Convergence","Passive optical networks","WiMAX","Wireless networks","Communication system traffic control","Costs","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","optical fibre networks","radio networks","telecommunication traffic","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive optical networks","IEEE 802.16","WiMAX","wireless networks","broadband access technologies","high-capacity wireless access networks","high-capacity wired access networks","gigabit PON","network traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Converged networks","IEEE 802.16 networks","Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON)","fixed-mobile convergence (FMC)","control bridge","quality of service (QoS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A control bridge to automate the convergence of Passive Optical Networks and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) wireless networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769135/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769135/","accessionNumber":"10470112","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A control bridge to automate the convergence of Passive Optical Networks and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) wireless networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071796S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753885","isNumber":"4769015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753885","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4769015","articleId":"4769135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4769140,"authors":[{"name":"Ramon J.

Wavelength-routed optical networks (WRONs) offer the possibility of dynamically adapting to traffic conditions by means of reconfiguring the logical topology, that is, the set of lightpaths embedded in it. However, reconfiguration has a cost, the number of packets lost during the reconfiguration process. Hence, it is necessary to use efficient reconfiguration policies and algorithms to design the logical topologies. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed to design logical topologies that jointly minimizes the number of lightpaths changed (reconfiguration cost) and the network congestion (reconfiguration reward). This method is based on the combination of genetic algorithms with Pareto optimality techniques. Thus, the algorithm provides a set of optimal (or near-optimal) solutions in terms of both parameters, the Pareto optimal set. Moreover, a novel policy to minimize the packet loss ratio considering all the solutions provided by the algorithm is also proposed. A simulation study is presented to show how the combination of the new algorithm and policy can reduce in more than one order of magnitude the packet loss ratio in stationary state and respond to abrupt changes in less time when compared with previous work on logical topology reconfiguration.","doi":"10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769140","startPage":"544","endPage":"551","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and

network planning: A multi-objective optimization approach","abstract":"A modern wireless network can be neither successfully deployed nor successfully expanded without proper planning. In this paper we consider the wireless mesh network (WMN) planning problem where not much work has been done. We propose a more realistic multi-objective approach to model this problem where the two conflicting objectives of total deployment cost and network throughput are to be optimized while guaranteeing full coverage to all mesh clients. Previous contributions have mainly formulated and solved this problem by using single-objective integer linear programming formulations and exact methods. The main limitation of these approaches resides in their restriction to small sized instances. We propose a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. This algorithm produces a set of good planning solutions for real-size networks thus enlarging the decision perspective of a network planner. We also discuss the effect of different parameters on the characteristics of the solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769149/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10478291","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769149/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wireless mesh network planning: A multi-objective optimization approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless mesh network planning: A multi-objective optimization approach","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073484S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753885","isNumber":"4769015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753885","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4769015","articleId":"4769149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4769172,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Saiful Alam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mohammad Saiful","lastName":"Alam","id":"38189399800"},{"name":"Newaz Muhammad Syfur Rahim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Newaz Muhammad","lastName":"Syfur Rahim","id":"38189217500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2014-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2015-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769172","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Discrete cosine transforms","Fourier transforms","Chromium","Wavelet transforms","Data compression","Quantization","Entropy","Distortion measurement","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG signal compression method","discrete cosine transform","residual beats","threshold vectors"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a discrete cosine transform (DCT) based ECG signal compression method is proposed.

In this paper, two evolutionary approaches, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been applied for adaptive subcarrier and bit allocations to minimize the overall transmit power of a multiuser OFDM system. Each user will be assigned a number of subcarriers with at least one minimum subcarrier even at the worst case. Then the number of bits and the transmit power level for each subcarrier are calculated. Simulation results show that both the evolutionary approaches outperform the conventional static resource allocation schemes considerably in multiuser scenario. The results further reveal that both the algorithms can handle large allocation of subcarriers without significant performance degradation. However the performance of PSO is found to be better than the GA in terms of execution time, simplicity and convergence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation based on modified Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for multiuser OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769202","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753886/4769162/04769202.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation based on modified Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for multiuser OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769202/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470142","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource allocation based on modified Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for multiuser OFDM systems","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05158S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753886","isNumber":"4769162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753886","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4769162","articleId":"4769202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4769203,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Foysol Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Development Alternative, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Syed Foysol","lastName":"Islam","id":"38189860800"},{"name":"Md.

Microchannel-based MF devices using electric fields are of recent research interest for various purposes, including on-chip manipulation of biological elements (cell, DNA, proteins and other macromolecules). To determine electric field strengths inside the microchannels of such devices, the uniform electric field equation (eg. E = deltaV/deltal) is commonly used. However, this can lead to a significant estimation error, especially for smaller dimensions of the microchannel, which is the future trend. Finite element method (FEM) analysis should be performed for such smaller dimensions. However, this method is time consuming and computationally expensive, particularly during design phases, as there exist many unbound parameters. In this paper, analytical expressions to determine electric fields and other parameters of interest are developed for a simplistic model, and then compared the FEM simulation results to that of MF devices for a range of microchannel dimensions. The results show that significant estimation errors can occur. For example, more than 10% overestimation of electric field results in microchannel lengths smaller than 2.5 mm. The analysis and graphs can aid MF device designers during design phases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of electric fields developed inside microchannels of microfluidic devices","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769212","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753886/4769162/04769212.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of electric fields developed inside microchannels of microfluidic devices","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769212/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10429239","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of electric fields developed inside microchannels of microfluidic devices","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070066S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753886","isNumber":"4769162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753886","xplore-issue":"4769162","articleId":"4769212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4769236,"authors":[{"name":"Saurav Zaman Khan Sajib","affiliation":["ALCATEL-LUCENT, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Saurav Zaman Khan","lastName":"Sajib","id":"38188081200"},{"name":"Ahmed Mostayed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kongju National University, Kongju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Mostayed","id":"37394830900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2014-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2015-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769236","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Amplitude modulation","Chirp modulation","Fourier transforms","Signal to noise ratio","Amplitude estimation","Phase estimation","Frequency estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","1f noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","Monte Carlo methods","parameter estimation","Radon transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation method","linear amplitude modulated chirp signals","discrete fractional Fourier transform","Radon Wigner transform","phase parameters","multicomponent chirp signals","Monte-Carlo simulation","signal to noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"A new parameter estimation method for linear amplitude modulated chirp signal is proposed.

Better performance was achieved at SNR as low as -10 dB.","doi":"10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769236","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753886/4769162/04769236.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769162","startPage":"380","endPage":"385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parameter estimation method for linear amplitude modulated chirp signals based on Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A parameter estimation method for linear amplitude modulated chirp signals based on Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769236/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470159","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4769236/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parameter estimation method for linear amplitude modulated chirp signals based on Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093273S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753886","isNumber":"4769162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753886","xplore-issue":"4769162","articleId":"4769236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4769240,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Rezvanian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Azad University of Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Rezvanian","id":"37546976200"},{"name":"Karim Faez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Azad University of Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Faez","id":"37270276800"},{"name":"Fariborz Mahmoudi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Azad University of Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Fariborz","lastName":"Mahmoudi","id":"37298750200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2014-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2015-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769240","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Digital images","Neural networks","Signal to noise ratio","Image processing","Image enhancement","Information filtering","Information filters","Nonlinear filters","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image enhancement","image resolution","impulse noise","median filters","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-pass method","impulse noise reduction","digital images","neural networks","image processing","image enhancement","median based filters","nonlinear filters","first pass impulse noise detection","ANFIS","impulse noise estimation","grayscale test images"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769240","abstract":"One of the most research challenges in image processing is image enhancement and reducing impulse noise from digital images. There are various methods for impulse noise reduction such as median based filters or nonlinear filters, but these methods more or less cause images to blur and to remove important details from images, as in high noise ratio in that noise reduction will destroy vital information such as edges and high amount of noise causes the image information be destroyed. Some ways are proposed to impulse noise reduction using soft computing that has a good performance. This paper presents an efficient method in two passes for reduction of impulse noise. At the first pass impulse noise detection using ANFIS, and at the second pass the impulse noise estimation, that corrupted noise pixel replaced with new value based on ANN. Our method is experimented on some popular grayscale test images and is compared to other methods using subjective and objective measures. Results show that our proposed method is efficient in impulse noise reduction and works better than the other compared methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769240","startPage":"400","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769162","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753886/4769162/04769240.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-pass method to impulse noise reduction from digital images based on neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769240/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A two-pass method to impulse noise reduction from digital images based on neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769240/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10459989","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-pass method to impulse noise reduction from digital images based on neural networks","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079124S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753886","isNumber":"4769162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753886","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4769162","articleId":"4769240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4769258,"authors":[{"name":"Nipa Chowdhury","affiliation":["Dept of CSE, Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology, Gazipur, Bangladesh","Dept of CSE, Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology, Gazipur"],"firstName":"Nipa","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37272641000"},{"name":"Mohammod Abul kashem","affiliation":["Dept of CSE, Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology, Gazipur"],"firstName":"Mohammod Abul","lastName":"kashem","id":"37085399342"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2014-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2015-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769258","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":886},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Feedforward systems","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Intrusion detection","Computer networks","Computer security","Computerized monitoring","Impedance","Data security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","recurrent neural nets","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feed-forward neural network","recurrent neural network","intrusion detection","computer systems security","back propagation training algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Recurrent neural network","Feed-forward neural network","Back propagation training Algorithm","Elman Recurrent nerwork"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769258","abstract":"As computer networks are grows exponentially security in computer system has become a foremost issue.

One of the critical goals of SPS is to maintain highest beam efficiency (BE) because the microwaves (MW) from SPS will be converted to utility power unlike the MW from communication satellites. Therefore the SPS will need a highly efficient microwave power transmission (MPT) system. Another aspect of SPS is to maintain side lobe levels (SLL) as minimum as possible to reduce interference to other communication systems. The SPS costs can be reduced if MPT efficiency is increased. Edge tapering of a phased array antenna, that requires a complicated system, is one way to decrease SLL and increase BE. It is also possible to achieve minimum SLL with randomly spaced element position but it does not guarantee higher BE and the determination of random element position is also a difficult task. A new method of edge tapering system from the concepts of isosceles trapezoidal distribution (ITD) of array excitation and unequal element position of antenna array was investigated both through the simulation and the experimentation. The method is named as dasiaITD edge tapering with unequal element spacing (ITDU)psila. ITDU method was compared with Gaussian edge tapering and simple ITD edge tapering. The lowest maximum side lobe level (MSLL) and the highest BE was achieved in newly derived ITDU technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769314","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753886/4769162/04769314.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECE.2008.4769314","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","startPage":"773","endPage":"777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New and improved method of beam forming with reduced Side Lobe Levels for microwave power transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"New and improved method of beam forming with reduced Side Lobe Levels for microwave power transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769314/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769314/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470206","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New and improved method of beam forming with reduced Side Lobe Levels for microwave power transmission","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"SPI-01222009-00152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0469S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753886","isNumber":"4769162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753886","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4769162","articleId":"4769314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4769338,"authors":[{"name":"Kazi Mostaq Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Stamford University, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Kazi Mostaq","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38186518700"},{"name":"Satya Prasad Majumder","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Satya Prasad","lastName":"Majumder","id":"37272715700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2014-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2015-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769338","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Wireless communication","Convolutional codes","Bit error rate","Fading","OFDM","Dispersion","MIMO","Transceivers","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","error correction codes","error statistics","fading","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM wireless communication system","convolutional coding","bit error rate performance analysis","fading effect","multipath dispersion","multiple-input multiple output transceiver configuration","error correction coding","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","ICI","Convolution-Code and MIMO"]}],"abstract":"The bit error rate (BER) performance analysis of an OFDM wireless communication system is carried out considering the effect of fading and multipath dispersion.

Although some semi-automatic and fully-automatic microinjection systems have been developed, a full understanding of the mechanical response of biological cells to injection operation remains deficient. In this paper, a new mechanical model based on membrane theory is proposed. This model establishes a relationship between the injection force and the deformation of biological cells with the quasi-static equilibrium equations, which are solved by the Runge-Kutta numerical method. Based on this model, other mechanical responses can also be inferred, such as the effect of the injector radius, the membrane stress and tension distribution, internal cell pressure, and the deformed cell shape. To verify the proposed model, experiments are performed on microinjection of zebrafish embryos at different developmental stages and medaka embryos at the blastula stage. It is demonstrated that the modeling results agree well with the experimental data, which shows that the proposed model can be used to estimate the mechanical properties of cell biomembranes.

This DBA scheme takes into consideration the specific features of the converged network to enable a smooth data transmission across optical and wireless networks, and an end-to-end differentiated service to user traffics of diverse QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. This QoS-aware DBA scheme supports bandwidth fairness at the VOB level and class-of-service fairness at the 802.16 subscriber station level.

In such a wireless broadband access system, in order to support QoS, the channel time is divided into consecutive frames, where each frame consists of some consequent mini-slots for the transmission of requests, used for the bandwidth reservation, and consequent slots for the actual data packet transmission. Three main outcomes are obtained: first, the upper and lower bounds of the capacity are derived for the considered system. Second, we found through the mathematical analysis that the transmission rate of reservation-based multiple access protocol is maximized, when the ratio between the number of mini-slots and that of the slots per frame is equal to the reciprocal of the random multiple access algorithm's transmission rate. Third, in the case of WiMax networks with a large number of subscribers, our analysis takes into account both the capacity and the mean packet delay criteria and suggests to keep such a ratio constant and independent of application-level data traffic arrival rate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","WiMAX","Media Access Protocol","Time division multiple access","Access protocols","Wireless application protocol","Communication system traffic control","Bandwidth","Mathematical analysis","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","bandwidth allocation","broadband networks","channel capacity","multi-access systems","quality of service","radio access networks","telecommunication traffic","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity analysis","random multiple access system","broadband wireless access network","medium access control protocol","WiMax technology","QoS","bandwidth reservation","data packet transmission","mathematical analysis","network traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["random access, capacity, reservation, medium access control, WiMAX"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4769382/04769392.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity analysis of reservation-based random access for broadband wireless access networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity analysis of reservation-based random access for broadband wireless access networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769392/","volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769392/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10429199","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity analysis of reservation-based random access for broadband wireless access networks","sourcePdf":"172jsac0209vinel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083753S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4769382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4769382","articleId":"4769392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4769395,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Gordejuela-Sanchez","affiliation":["CWIND (Center of Wireless Network Design), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4769382/4769395/4769395-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fernando Gordejuela-S\u00e1nchez obtained his B.Eng. and M.Eng. in Telecommunications Engineering from Miguel Hernandez University (UMH) in Alicante, Spain in 2003 and 2005 respectively.

In the first stage of the network development, the most important issue is to find an appropriate solution to the base station location from a given set of candidate sites. The network can be considerably improved if the base station location solution found during the planning phase is designed to achieve optimal performance, and also reliable and cost-effective mobile WiMax networks. The design process is done through computer simulation to predict the network performance, and it is often carried out by planning and optimization tools similar to those used in the development of 2nd generation cellular networks (2G) with a few adaptations. The multiobjective optimization framework gives network providers a new perspective in mobile WiMax access network design, providing a clear and comprehensive description of different options and solutions to achieve an optimal base station location. Also, it analyzes the network performance with the mobile WiMax-specific parameters that most importantly affect the access network design process. It simplifies the problem and translates it into a formal optimization routine with consideration of economic factors in mobile WiMax networks. This has been done by using the method of the Pareto front, and the use of an optimization strategy based on a modified version of the metaheuristic Tabu search adapted to multiobjective optimization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiobjective optimization framework for IEEE 802.16e network design and performance analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090211","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4769382/04769395.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","displayDocTitle":"A multiobjective optimization framework for IEEE 802.16e network design and performance analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4769395/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"February 2009","accessionNumber":"10429202","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiobjective optimization framework for IEEE 802.16e network design and performance analysis","sourcePdf":"202jsac0209sanchez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112002S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4769382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4769382","articleId":"4769395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4769396,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Biagioni","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunication, University of Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4769382/4769396/4769396-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Biagioni was born in Pistoia, Italy, in 1982.

The use of OFDM transmissions has been proposed to reduce the effect of multipath fading in wireless communications. Moreover, multiple access is achieved by resorting to the OFDMA scheme. Adaptive subcarrier allocation techniques have been selected to exploit the multiuser diversity, leading to an improvement of performance by assigning subchannels to the users accordingly with their channel conditions. A method to allocate subcarriers is to assign almost an equal bandwidth to all users (fair allocation). However, it is well known that this method limits the bandwidth efficiency of the system. In order to lower this drawback, in this paper, two different adaptive subcarrier allocation algorithms are proposed and analyzed. Their aim is to share the network bandwidth among users on the basis of specific channel conditions without loosing bandwidth efficiency and fairness. Performance comparisons with the static and the fair allocation approaches are presented in terms of bit error rate and throughput to highlight the better behavior of the proposed schemes in particular when users have different distances from the BS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4769382/04769396.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive subcarrier allocation schemes for wireless ofdma systems in wimax networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","OFDM","Bandwidth","Fading","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Frequency conversion","Media Access Protocol","Bit rate","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","broadband networks","channel allocation","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","multipath channels","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive subcarrier allocation scheme","wireless OFDMA system","WiMax network","broadband wireless access","multipath fading","multiuser diversity","channel assignment","bandwidth allocation","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive systems, Subcarrier allocation, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access, WiMAX"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive subcarrier allocation schemes for wireless ofdma systems in wimax networks","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4769396/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2009","accessionNumber":"10429203","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive subcarrier allocation schemes for wireless ofdma systems in wimax networks","sourcePdf":"217jsac0209biagioni.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091728S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4769382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4769382","articleId":"4769396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4769397,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4769382/4769397/4769397-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianwei Huang (S'01-M'06) is an Assistant Professor in Information Engg.

However, scheduling and resource allocation in an OFDM system is complicated, especially in the uplink due to two reasons: (i) the discrete nature of subchannel assignments, and (ii) the heterogeneity of the users' subchannel conditions, individual resource constraints and application requirements. We approach this problem using a gradient-based scheduling framework. Physical layer resources (bandwidth and power) are allocated to maximize the projection onto the gradient of a total system utility function which models application-layer Quality of Service (QoS). This is formulated as a convex optimization problem and solved using a dual decomposition approach. This optimal solution has prohibitively high computational complexity but reveals guiding principles that we use to generate lower complexity sub-optimal algorithms. We analyze the complexity and compare the performance of these algorithms via extensive simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","volume":"27","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10469659","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4769397/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint scheduling and resource allocation in uplink OFDM systems for broadband wireless access networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint scheduling and resource allocation in uplink OFDM systems for broadband wireless access networks","sourcePdf":"226jsac0209huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118877S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4769382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"210","xplore-issue":"4769382","articleId":"4769397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4769398,"authors":[{"name":"James She","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4769382/4769398/4769398-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["James She is a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada.

In the framework, multiple description coding (MDC) on scalable video bitstreams at the source for achieving multiresolution robustness is jointly designed with superposition coding (SCM) on multicast signals at the channel to overcome multiuser channel diversity in wireless multicast. The coded multicast signals under the proposed framework can cope with multiuser channel diversity and mitigate the impact due to short-term channel fluctuations, which are the two most challenging issues in achieving robust and efficient video multicasting in metropolitan areas. We formulate the proposed framework and analyze its video quality performance in terms of the total receivable/ recoverable bitstreams by a receiver. A heuristic methodology is developed for system parameter selection and performance optimization that can be applied to practical scenarios of video multicasting for IPTV services in WiMAX. Simulation is conducted based on actual standard video sequences to verify the proposed methodology on parameter selection and performance optimization. Performance gains of the proposed cross-layer design framework in the presence of fading channel diversity are demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4769382/04769398.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cross-layer design framework for robust IPTV services over IEEE 802.16 networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"A cross-layer design framework for robust IPTV services over IEEE 802.16 networks","volume":"27","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10469660","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4769398/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross-layer design framework for robust IPTV services over IEEE 802.16 networks","sourcePdf":"235jsac0209she.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094907S","chronDate":"February  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4769382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4769382","articleId":"4769398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4769444,"authors":[{"name":"Arijit Ukil","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Arijit","lastName":"Ukil","id":"37395677900"},{"name":"Jaydip Sen","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Jaydip","lastName":"Sen","id":"37296443700"},{"name":"Debasish Bera","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Debasish","lastName":"Bera","id":"37410116200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3521-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3334-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769444","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","WiMAX","Quality of service","Throughput","System performance","Delay","Technological innovation","Heuristic algorithms","Diversity methods","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA based WiMAX system","heterogeneous traffic","priority indexed long-term resource allocation algorithm","broadband wireless network","proportional fair metric algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","optimization scheme","QoS requirement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiMAX","OFDMA resource allocation","QoS","longterm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an efficient scheme to optimize resource allocation for dynamic OFDMA based WiMAX systems is presented, which provides priority estimated resource allocation with individual QoS provisioning. Our proposed scheme dynamically assigns OFDMA resources to the users to optimize the overall system performance in heterogeneous traffic and diverse QoS based WiMAX systems. To achieve this goal, we have introduced priority indexed long-term (PILTPF) resource allocation algorithm, which dynamically allocates the OFDMA resources to the users to meet their QoS requirement, which is dependent on userpsilas derived priority profile. It also considers the time diversity gain achieved in long-term computation of proportional fair (PF) metric. PILTPF algorithm emphasizes on individual userpsilas true priority in allocating system resources in order to maintain as well as optimize the requirements of different QoS classes, existing in the current and next generation broadband wireless networks like WiMAX. Simulation results show considerable improvement of performance due to priority based resource allocation with long term PF calculation with respect to traditional PF algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCET.2009.10","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4769406/4769407/04769444.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCET.2009.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Optimization Scheme for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Based WiMAX Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769444/","displayDocTitle":"A New Optimization Scheme for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Based WiMAX Systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10468010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769444/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Optimization Scheme for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Based WiMAX Systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3521a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036582S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4769406","isNumber":"4769407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4769406","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4769407","articleId":"4769444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4769463,"authors":[{"name":"Kaur Inderjeet","affiliation":["Dept of CSE, Institute of Technology & Management, Gurgaon, India"],"firstName":"Kaur","lastName":"Inderjeet","id":"37088436150"},{"name":"Thakur Kamal","affiliation":["Dept of CSE, Institute of Technology & Management, Gurgaon, India"],"firstName":"Thakur","lastName":"Kamal","id":"37088435313"},{"name":"M.

Czylwik<br>in the Proceedings of the IEEE 47th Vehicular Technology Conference, 1997, vol.2, pp. 865-869, May 1997<br><br>  <br/> The aim of the present paper is to compare multicarrier and single carrier modulation schemes for wireless communication systems. In both cases the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and its inverse are utilized. In case of OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), the inverse FFT transforms the complex amplitudes of the individual subcarriers at the transmitter into time domain. At the receiver the inverse operation is carried out. In case of single carrier modulation, the FFT and its inverse are used at the input and output of the frequency domain equalizer in the receiver. Different single carrier and multi-carrier transmission systems are simulated with time-variant transfer functions measured with a wideband channel sounder. In case of OFDM, the individual sub-carriers are modulated with fixed and adaptive signal alphabets. Furthermore, a frequency-independent as well as the optimum power distribution are used. Single carrier modulation uses a single carrier, instead of the hundreds or thousands typically used in OFDM, so the peak-to-average transmitted power ratio for single carrier modulated signals is smaller. This in turn means that a SC system requires a smaller linear range to support a given average power. This enables the use of cheaper power amplifier as compared to OFDM system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4769406/4769407/04769463.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCET.2009.243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCET.2009.243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Adaptive OFDM Vs Single Carrier Modulation with Frequency Domain Equalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Adaptive OFDM Vs Single Carrier Modulation with Frequency Domain Equalization","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10478100","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Adaptive OFDM Vs Single Carrier Modulation with Frequency Domain Equalization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3521a238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123629S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","isNumber":"4769407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4769406","articleId":"4769463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4769477,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, BUAA, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wang","id":"38190193300"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, BUAA, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538570000"},{"name":"Yawei Tian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, BUAA, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yawei","lastName":"Tian","id":"38187263500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3521-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3334-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769477","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Resource management","Performance analysis","Optimization methods","Analytical models","Pareto optimization","Cost function","Genetic engineering","Algorithm design and analysis","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commerce","genetic algorithms","iterative methods","performance index"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective parameter","optimization technology","business process","genetic algorithm","performance evaluation","iterative method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["business process","multi-objective optimization","parameter optimization","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769477","abstract":"The idea of simulation analysis and multi-objective evaluation was applied in parameter optimization for business process.

This code is constructed using code segment and data segment. One of the important properties of this code is that the cross correlation at data segment is always zero, which means that phase intensity induced noise (PIIN) is reduced. For the performance analysis, the effects of phase-induced intensity noise, shot noise, and thermal noise are considered simultaneously.

The introduced EvoMP (Evolvable MultiProcessor) is a novel NoC-based homogeneous MPSoC system that performs decomposition and scheduling using evolutionary algorithms at run-time. A hardware genetic core was used in first version of this platform to perform these two tasks. This core tries to find an efficient solution for decomposition and scheduling of the target application among available computational resources. This paper presents the new version of this system in which a hardware particle swarm optimization (PSO) core is exploited to perform evolutionary decomposition and scheduling. The principle of operation and architecture of the EvoMP platform and the PSO core is briefly explained in this paper. The simulation and synthesis results of this PSO-based EvoMP is also presented and compared with prior genetic-base approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769552/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10478105","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4769552/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Run-Time Task Decomposition and Scheduling in Evolvable MPSoC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Run-Time Task Decomposition and Scheduling in Evolvable MPSoC","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3521b028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063535S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4769406","isNumber":"4769538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4769406","xplore-issue":"4769538","articleId":"4769552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4769557,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Chul Park","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Chul","lastName":"Park","id":"37275453300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3521-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3334-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769557","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769557","abstract":"A time-series prediction model using a Bilinear Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN) is proposed in this paper.

In this work we focus on the impact of faults on the neural computation in order to show neural paradigms cannot be considered intrinsically fault-tolerant. A high abstraction level (corresponding to the neural graph) error model is introduced in this paper. We propose fault model and present an analysis of the usability of our method for fault masking.

In this paper, a novel and efficient VLSI architecture is proposed to design Ternary Pulse compression sequences with good discrimination factor. The VLSI architecture is implemented on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) as it provides the flexibility of reconfigurability and reprogramability. The implemented architecture overcomes the drawbacks of non guaranteed convergence of the earlier optimization algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCET.2009.222","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4769406/4769538/04769621.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCET.2009.222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769538","startPage":"353","endPage":"357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of the Ternary Pulse Compression Sequences with Good Discrimination Factor Values","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of the Ternary Pulse Compression Sequences with Good Discrimination Factor Values","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769621/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10468156","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4769621/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of the Ternary Pulse Compression Sequences with Good Discrimination Factor Values","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3521b353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065372S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4769406","isNumber":"4769538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4769406","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4769538","articleId":"4769621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4769658,"authors":[{"name":"Arif Irwansyah","affiliation":["VLSI-eCAD Research Laboratory (VeCAD), Department of Microelectronics and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Arif","lastName":"Irwansyah","id":"38287239300"},{"name":"Vishnu P.

In order to show the effectiveness of tightly coupled hardware implementation over coprocessor based approach, we have also realized the design in coprocessor approach using the same AES core.

To predict the performance of these links, a firm understanding of how the inherent optical properties of water affect the encoded optical signal is needed. Of particular interest is the impact of scattering due to particulates. Typically, the link loss is computed using the beam attenuation coefficient, which describes the attenuation of nonscattered light due to absorption and scattering. This approach is insufficient, as it neglects the contribution of scattered light to the total received signal. Given the dynamic nature of underwater platforms, as well as the dynamic nature of the environment itself, knowledge of the angular dependence of forward-scattered light is imperative for determining pointing and tracking requirements as well as overall signal to noise. In this work, the theory necessary to describe spatial spreading of an optical beam in the presence of scattering agents underwater is reviewed. This theory is then applied to a performance prediction model that is validated via laboratory experiments. Finally, the model is used to study the impact of spatial spreading on an underwater optical link.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769674/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","volume":"33","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10471659","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4769674/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of the Beam-Spread Function for Underwater Wireless Optical Communications Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of the Beam-Spread Function for Underwater Wireless Optical Communications Links","sourcePdf":"joe-bcochenour-2005341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099171S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4769672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4769672","articleId":"4769674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4769676,"authors":[{"name":"Eduard Calvo","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4769672/4769676/4769676-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eduard Calvo (S'02) received the electrical engineering degree (with highest honors) from the Telecom Barcelona School, Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Catalonia, Spain, in 2004, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Signal Theory and Communications.","Since 2005 he has been the recipient of a Spanish Ministry of Education and Science Research Grant at the Department of Signal Theory and Communications, UPC, where he has participated in several European projects such as IST-ROMANTIK (2003\u20132004), IST-SURFACE (2006\u20132008), and IST-FIREWORKS (2006\u20132008).

Adaptive estimation is performed using minimum mean square error as the overall optimization criterion. The receiver is implemented in a multichannel configuration, which provides the array processing gain necessary for many of the underwater acoustic channels. The complexity of the detection algorithm is linear in the number of receive elements and it does not depend on the modulation level of the transmitted signals.

Intermediate nodes between source and destination act as cooperative relays. Herein, protocols coupled with space-time block code (STBC) strategies are proposed and analyzed for distributed cooperative communication. Amplify-and-forward-type protocols are considered, in which intermediate relays do not attempt to decode the information. The Alamouti-based cooperative scheme proposed by Hua (2003) for flat-fading channels is generalized to work in the presence of multipath, thus addressing a main characteristic of underwater acoustic channels. A time-reversal distributed space-time block code (TR-DSTBC) is proposed, which extends the dual-antenna TR-STBC (time-reversal space-time block code) approach from Lindskog and Paulraj (2000) to a cooperative communication scenario for signaling in multipath. It is first shown that, just as in the dual-antenna STBC case, TR along with the orthogonality of the DSTBC essentially allows for decoupling of the vector intersymbol interference (ISI) detection problem into separate scalar problems, and thus yields strong performance (compared with single-hop communication) and with substantially reduced complexity over nonorthogonal schemes. Furthermore, a performance analysis of the proposed scheme is carried out to provide insight on the performance gains, which are further confirmed via numerical results based on computer simulations and field data experiments.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"489","endPage":"501","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2008.2005338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2008.2005338","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4769672/04769694.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Space\u2013Time Cooperative Schemes for Underwater Acoustic Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769694/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Space\u2013Time Cooperative Schemes for Underwater Acoustic Communications","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10471656","volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4769694/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Space\u2013Time Cooperative Schemes for Underwater Acoustic Communications","sourcePdf":"joe-mvajapeyam-2005338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065258S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4769672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4769672","articleId":"4769694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4769697,"authors":[{"name":"Shefeng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway","Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4769672/4769697/4769697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shefeng Yan (M'05) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 1999, 2001, and 2005, respectively.","From July 2005 to March 2007, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

This paper describes a new robust pattern synthesis approach to arrays with manifold vectors perturbation. This synthesis technique optimizes the worst case performance by minimizing the worst case sidelobe level while maintaining a distortionless respect to the worst case signal steering vector. The possible values of the manifold are covered by an ellipsoid that describes the uncertainty in terms of errors in element gains and phase angles. The pattern synthesis parameters can be optimally chosen based on known levels of uncertainty in the manifold vectors.

Both criteria of the robust beamformer problem can be reformulated in a convex form of second-order cone programming, which is computationally tractable. A simple lower bound on the difference between the worse case sidelobe level of the robust beamformer and the sidelobe level of the nominal optimal beamformer with no array manifold uncertainty is derived. This robust approach is applicable to arrays with arbitrary geometry. Its effectiveness is illustrated through its application to a circular hydrophone array. An experiment is performed to measure the manifold vectors uncertainty set of hydrophone arrays. Results of applying the algorithms to both simulated and experimental data are presented and they show good performance of the proposed robust pattern synthesis approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10471661","htmlLink":"/document/4769697/","displayDocTitle":"Array Pattern Synthesis With Robustness Against Manifold Vectors Uncertainty","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array Pattern Synthesis With Robustness Against Manifold Vectors Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"joe-yan-2002583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108492S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4769672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4769672","articleId":"4769697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4769970,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Lin","affiliation":["Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK","School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Lin","id":"37675006100"},{"name":"Jian-Ping Li","affiliation":["Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK","School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","International Centre for Wavelet Analysis and Its Applications, Logistical Engineering University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Ping","lastName":"Li","id":"38190001000"},{"name":"Hui Lin","affiliation":["Leshan Vocational& Technical college, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Lin","id":"37675647700"},{"name":"Ji Ming","affiliation":["International Centre for Wavelet Analysis and Its Applications, Logistical Engineering University, Chongqing, China","Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Ming","id":"37275945100"},{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293647500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3426-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3427-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769970","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"abstract":"The posterior union decision-based neural network (PUD-BNN) has been proposed in our previous work for dealing with face recognition task subject to partial occlusion and distortion.

Firstly, the new approach artificially constructs some new training data with original training images for complementing training data. Moreover, an efficient density estimation method is used into PUDBNN to tackle the reliable likelihood densities estimation with insufficient training samples. The new approach has been evaluated on two face image databases, XM2VTS and AR, using testing images subjected to various types of partial distortion and occlusion. The new system has demonstrated improved performance over other systems acronyms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752633/4769956/04769970.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"61","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","doi":"10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4769970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4769970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Face Recognition with Partial Distortion and Occlusion from Small Number of Samples Per Class","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Face recognition","Neural networks","Training data","Computer science","Wavelet analysis","Application software","Educational institutions","Electronic mail","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","face recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","partial distortion","occlusion","posterior union decision-based neural network","density estimation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Posterior union model","local distortion and occlusion","robustness","face recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4769970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust Face Recognition with Partial Distortion and Occlusion from Small Number of Samples Per Class","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4769970/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10458300","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Face Recognition with Partial Distortion and Occlusion from Small Number of Samples Per Class","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICACIA-00-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078911S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752633","isNumber":"4769956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752633","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4769956","articleId":"4769970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4769978,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Hu","id":"38189163700"},{"name":"Xiao-Mei Qiu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Mei","lastName":"Qiu","id":"38187692200"},{"name":"De-Tao He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"De-Tao","lastName":"He","id":"38187112100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3426-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3427-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4769978","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Neural networks","Data mining","Wavelet domain","Robustness","Spread spectrum communication","Protection","Multi-layer neural network","Sorting","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","neural nets","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital audio watermarking algorithm","neural networks","digital audio data","copyright protection","ownership verification","covert communication","watermark generation","origin audio signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural","digital Watermark"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4769978","abstract":"Digital audio watermarking is embedded inaudible information into digital audio data for the purposes of copyright protection, ownership verification, covert communication, and/or auxiliary data carrying.
