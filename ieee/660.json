Our processing algorithm utilizes a kernel on the GPU to pack arbitrary noncontiguous GPU data by enriching the datatypes encoding to expose a fine-grained, data-point level of parallelism. Additionally, the typically tree-based datatype encoding is preprocessed to enable efficient, cached access across GPU threads. Using CUDA, we show that the computational method outperforms DMA-based alternatives for several common data layouts as well as more complex data layouts for which reasonable DMA-based processing does not exist. Our method incurs low overhead for data layouts that closely match best-case DMA usage or that can be processed by layout-specific implementations. We additionally investigate usage scenarios for data packing that incur resource contention, identifying potential pitfalls for various packing strategies. We also demonstrate the efficacy of kernel-based packing in various communication scenarios, showing multifold improvement in point-to-point communication and evaluating packing within the context of the SHOC stencil benchmark and HACC mesh analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6895194/06600679.pdf","startPage":"2627","endPage":"2637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.234","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processing MPI Derived Datatypes on Noncontiguous GPU-Resident Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Processing MPI Derived Datatypes on Noncontiguous GPU-Resident Data","volume":"25","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"14580866","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6600679/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing MPI Derived Datatypes on Noncontiguous GPU-Resident Data","sourcePdf":"tpds-jenkins-234-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070316S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6895194","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6895194","articleId":"6600679","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6600686,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfeng Zhang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, P.R.

These algorithms are implemented in a large-scale distributed environment to scale to massive data sets. To accelerate these large-scale graph-based iterative computations, we propose delta-based accumulative iterative computation (DAIC). Different from traditional iterative computations, which iteratively update the result based on the result from the previous iteration, DAIC updates the result by accumulating the \u201cchanges\u201d between iterations. By DAIC, we can process only the \u201cchanges\u201d to avoid the negligible updates. Furthermore, we can perform DAIC asynchronously to bypass the high-cost synchronous barriers in heterogeneous distributed environments. Based on the DAIC model, we design and implement an asynchronous graph processing framework, Maiter. We evaluate Maiter on local cluster as well as on Amazon EC2 Cloud.

The messages take values from a finite alphabet, and unlike traditional quantized decoders which are quantized versions of the belief propagation (BP) decoder, the proposed finite alphabet iterative decoders (FAIDs) do not propagate quantized probabilities or log-likelihoods and the variable node update functions do not mimic the BP decoder. Rather, the update functions are maps designed using the knowledge of potentially harmful subgraphs that could be present in a given code, thereby rendering these decoders capable of outperforming the BP in the error floor region. On certain column-weight-three codes of practical interest, we show that there exist {FAIDs that surpass the floating-point BP decoder in the error floor region while requiring only three bits of precision for the representation of the messages}. Hence, FAIDs are able to achieve a superior performance at much lower complexity. We also provide a methodology for the selection of FAIDs that is not code-specific, but gives a set of candidate FAIDs containing potentially good decoders in the error floor region for any column-weight-three code. We validate the code generality of our methodology by providing particularly good three-bit precision FAIDs for a variety of codes with different rates and lengths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","volume":"61","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13917993","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6600695/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders\u2014Part I: Decoding Beyond Belief Propagation on the Binary Symmetric Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders\u2014Part I: Decoding Beyond Belief Propagation on the Binary Symmetric Channel","sourcePdf":"4033-tc1310-shiva.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228093S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6672054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6672054","articleId":"6600695","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6600696,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To compensate the performance loss caused by the outdated CSI, we propose the weighted RS scheme, in which a deterministic weight factor is introduced in the selection process. The performance bound of outage probability for the weighted RS is derived and verified, along with the asymptotic expression. Based on the analytical expression, the optimal weight factor in minimizing the outage probability is obtained. Simulation results reveal that when the CSI is outdated, the proposed RS with the optimal weight factor yields the significant performance gain over the conventional RS, especially in high signal-to-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2013.091013.130529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684698","startPage":"651","endPage":"654","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6684698/06600701.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2013.091013.130529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Amplify-and-Forward Relay Selection with Outdated Channel State Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Optimized production technology","Signal to noise ratio","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Performance gain","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted amplify-and-forward relay selection","outdated channel state information","cooperative communications","CSI","weighted RS scheme","deterministic weight factor","asymptotic expression","optimal weight factor","outage probability minimization","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay selection","amplify-and-forward","outdated channel state information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Amplify-and-Forward Relay Selection with Outdated Channel State Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600701/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6600701/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13973527","publicationDate":"December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Amplify-and-Forward Relay Selection with Outdated Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"651-wcl1312-cui.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059365S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6684698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6684698","articleId":"6600701","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6600703,"authors":[{"name":"Canute Vaz","affiliation":["Semiconductor and Dimensional Metrology Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6672054/6600703/6600703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Canute Vaz (M'09) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.","From 2011 to 2012, he was a post-doctoral researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD.

It makes use of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) implemented with filter banks, and is based on expressing the convolution of two signals using the Forward Merge Approach for DWT-based convolution. The DWT-based deconvolution technique is then applied to the problem of pilot-based channel estimation, which can be used in the design of wavelet-based agile radio systems. \\par DWT-based deconvolution is first described analytically and is then implemented in MATLAB to validate the theory and evaluate its performance. Monte Carlo simulations of DWT-based deconvolution of transmitted signals from received signals, both known a priori, are performed to estimate channel impulse responses. Transmitted signals are corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) resulting in E_b/N_0 ratios ranging from 0 dB to 30 dB. Fast-fading channels with Gaussian and \"hilly area\" Power Delay Profiles (PDPs) are used, along with four different wavelets for the DWTs. The results of the simulations show that DWT-based deconvolution is a viable technique and its performance in some cases is comparable to direct discrete time-domain deconvolution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Communications Channels Using Discrete Wavelet Transform-Based Deconvolution","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.090513.110272","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6672054/06600703.pdf","startPage":"4186","endPage":"4195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.090513.110272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Communications Channels Using Discrete Wavelet Transform-Based Deconvolution","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6600703/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918020","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Communications Channels Using Discrete Wavelet Transform-Based Deconvolution","sourcePdf":"4186-tc1310-vaz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094636S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6672054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6672054","articleId":"6600703","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6600704,"authors":[{"name":"Michael S.

Two major challenges will be i) providing backhaul to all of these cells and ii) finding efficient techniques to leverage higher frequency bands for mobile access and backhaul. This paper proposes the use of outdoor millimeter wave communications for backhaul networking between cells and mobile access within a cell. To overcome the outdoor impairments found in millimeter wave propagation, this paper studies beamforming using large arrays. However, such systems will require narrow beams, increasing sensitivity to movement caused by pole sway and other environmental concerns. To overcome this, we propose an efficient beam alignment technique using adaptive subspace sampling and hierarchical beam codebooks. A wind sway analysis is presented to establish a notion of beam coherence time. This highlights a previously unexplored tradeoff between array size and wind-induced movement. Generally, it is not possible to use larger arrays without risking a corresponding performance loss from wind-induced beam misalignment. The performance of the proposed alignment technique is analyzed and compared with other search and alignment methods. The results show significant performance improvement with reduced search time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","volume":"61","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13918012","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6600706/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter Wave Beamforming for Wireless Backhaul and Access in Small Cell Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter Wave Beamforming for Wireless Backhaul and Access in Small Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"4391-tc1310-hur.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138429S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6672054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"649","xplore-issue":"6672054","articleId":"6600706","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6600707,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6672054/6600707/6600707-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Jin Kim received the B.S. and Ph.D degrees in electronic and electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Gyeongbuk, Korea, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

For spectrum sharing with coordination among co-located secondary systems, we propose both centralized and distributed beamforming algorithms. The proposed algorithms minimize the total transmit power of secondary systems, while maintaining the interference to PUs below a certain threshold and satisfying the Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraint for each secondary system. The centralized algorithm achieves the optimal transmit power by exploiting the virtual uplink-downlink duality using the knowledge of the channel state information for all the secondary links. However, the assumption of global channel knowledge at each secondary system may not be allowed in practical applications for multi-cell coordination. To address this problem, we design a distributed transceiver beamformer that satisfies the interference constraint to protect PUs. On the basis of this distributed beamformer, we also propose power allocation algorithms that guarantee the QoS for secondary systems. Distributed beamforming and power allocations operate iteratively to minimize the total transmit power. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithms achieve a near-optimal transmit power while satisfying both the QoS and interference constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.090513.120403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6672054/06600707.pdf","startPage":"4127","endPage":"4138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.090513.120403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Efficient Transceiver Designs for Multi-Cell Coordination in MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600707/","displayDocTitle":"Power Efficient Transceiver Designs for Multi-Cell Coordination in MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13917995","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600707/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Efficient Transceiver Designs for Multi-Cell Coordination in MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"4127-tc1310-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11353S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6672054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6672054","articleId":"6600707","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600708,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Gutman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6672054/6600708/6600708-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Igor Gutman currently working toward his Ph.D degree in the Dept. of ECE at the Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel, where he received both the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. degrees in 2006, and in 2009 respectively. from 2003 to 2004 he was an intern in Intel, Israel, and during 2005 to 2006 an intern in GO Networks (acquired by NextWave), Israel. from 2006 to 2009 he held a position of a signal processing engineer in Alvarion, Israel.

We introduce three major performance criteria of the system: (i) power efficiency of the PA, (ii) spectral purity of the transmitted signal expressed by adjacent channel interference, and (iii) transmission performance expressed by mutual information or symbol error rate. In order to fulfill the first two criteria it is proposed to use iterative clipping and filtering (ICF) at the transmitter together with low input back-off, while the third criterion is obtained by modified iterative receiver (MIR). The proposed MIR is based on the well-known iterative receiver, but with ICF in the feedback path. The obtained results show that the proposed system is better than its competitors when considering the three performance criteria together. The analysis and results are focused on OFDM; however, the proposed approach may be applied to single carrier.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.090513.120983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6672054/06600708.pdf","startPage":"4284","endPage":"4293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.090513.120983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Decoding of Iterative Clipped and Filtered OFDM Signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600708/","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Decoding of Iterative Clipped and Filtered OFDM Signal","volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13917996","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600708/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Decoding of Iterative Clipped and Filtered OFDM Signal","sourcePdf":"4284-tc1310-gutman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083186S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6672054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6672054","articleId":"6600708","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600709,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Khattab","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, Cairo University, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6672054/6600709/6600709-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Khattab received his B.

However, such theoretically-optimized distributed OSA approaches are challenged by several practical implementation issues. In this paper, we design a custom cross-layer framework that enables the: (i) clean-slate implementation of a wide variety of OSA mechanisms; (ii) experimental evaluation of the individual practical OSA components of the Rate-Adaptive Probabilistic (RAP) framework; and (iii) detailed comparison of the performance of such a practical OSA approach against theoretical OSA approaches developed for fully-capable CRNs. Our evaluation reveals the multi-fold goodput improvement and remarkable fairness characteristics of the practical RAP OSA approach compared to the OSA approaches that overlook the OSA and CR practical limitations. However, the superior performance of practical OSA comes at the expense of more outages to the primary licensed networks but within the permissible bounds. Another key finding is that the wide family of existing theoretically-optimized OSA protocols can benefit from the gains available to the individual components of the practical RAP approach, namely, the random spectrum sensing and the probabilistic non-greedy access.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.090513.130060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672054","startPage":"4139","endPage":"4150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6672054/06600709.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, Implementation and Characterization of Practical Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6600709/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design, Implementation and Characterization of Practical Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918006","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Implementation and Characterization of Practical Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"4139-tc1310-ahmed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087378S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6672054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6672054","articleId":"6600709","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600710,"authors":[{"name":"Pengda Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Pengda","lastName":"Huang","id":"37071786100"},{"name":"Dinesh Rajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Rajan","id":"37270183200"},{"name":"Joseph Camp","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Camp","id":"37286215100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6600710","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":474},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Estimation","Fading","Correlation","Damping","OFDM","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","channel estimation","fading channels","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive Doppler spread estimator","fading channel autocorrelation","fast-fading mobile communication systems","Doppler estimation scheme","damped sinusoid","AR model","Doppler value","numerical simulation","vehicular communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler spread estimation","OFDM system","fading channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600710","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2013.091113.130593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2013.091113.130593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6684698/06600710.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Autoregressive Doppler Spread Estimator for Fading Channels","abstract":"Doppler spread causes a significant performance degradation in fast-fading mobile communication systems.

By employing BD-type precoding algorithms at the transmit side, the MU-MIMO broadcast channel is decomposed into multiple independent parallel single user MIMO (SU-MIMO) channels and achieves the maximum diversity order at high data rates. The main computational complexity of BD-type precoding algorithms comes from two singular value decomposition (SVD) operations, which depend on the number of users and the dimensions of each user's channel matrix. In this work, low-complexity precoding algorithms are proposed to reduce the computational complexity and improve the performance of BD-type precoding algorithms. We devise a strategy based on a common channel inversion technique, QR decompositions, and lattice reductions to decouple the MU-MIMO channel into equivalent SU-MIMO channels. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed precoding algorithms can achieve a comparable sum-rate performance as BD-type precoding algorithms, substantial bit error rate (BER) performance gains, and a simplified receiver structure, while requiring a much lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.090513.130038","startPage":"4232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6672054/06600711.pdf","endPage":"4242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.090513.130038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600711/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Design of Low-Complexity Block Diagonalization Type Precoding Algorithms for Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"61","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6600711/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13917991","publicationDate":"October 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Design of Low-Complexity Block Diagonalization Type Precoding Algorithms for Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"4232-tc1310-keke.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089296S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6672054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6672054","articleId":"6600711","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600712,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Zamkotsian","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Zamkotsian","id":"37085335452"},{"name":"Kostas P.

The performance of vertical buoy-based surface-to-bottom (downlink) UWOC systems where the source is located on the sea surface has not been studied yet to the best of our knowledge. In practice, the performance of buoy-based downlink UWOC systems will be affected by both the random sea surface slopes caused by wind and scattering property of seawater. In this letter, we take these two factors into account and investigate the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of this downlink UWOC system. We develop a theoretical model to numerically characterize the relationship among transmit power, link range, wind speed, BER and water types for downlink UWOC system. Numerical results suggest the system BER performance degraded by wind speed can be compensated as the turbidity of seawater increases.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.091113.131363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6674967/06600714.pdf","startPage":"2164","endPage":"2167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.091113.131363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Random Sea Surface on Downlink Underwater Wireless Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2013","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Random Sea Surface on Downlink Underwater Wireless Optical Communications","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2013","accessionNumber":"13933973","htmlLink":"/document/6600714/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Random Sea Surface on Downlink Underwater Wireless Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"2164-cl1311-dong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084331S","chronDate":"November  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6674967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6674967","articleId":"6600714","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6600717,"authors":[{"name":"Hauke Holtkamp","affiliation":["DOCOMO Euro-Labs, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Hauke","lastName":"Holtkamp","id":"38196071100"},{"name":"Gunther Auer","affiliation":["DOCOMO Euro-Labs, Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Gunther","lastName":"Auer","id":"37269753500"},{"name":"Vito Giannini","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Vito","lastName":"Giannini","id":"37277059200"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6600717","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":889},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Bandwidth","Biological system modeling","Base stations","Computational modeling","Adaptation models","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","energy conservation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameterized base station power model","cellular base stations","power consumption analysis","power saving techniques","cellular networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","power model","earth","power consumption","mobile communications"]}],"abstract":"Power models are needed to assess the power consumption of cellular base stations (BSs) on an abstract level.

These decoders are capable of surpassing belief propagation (BP) in the error floor region on the binary symmetric channel (BSC) with much lower complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme with the objective of guaranteeing the correction of a given and potentially large number of errors on column-weight-three LDPC codes. The proposed scheme uses a plurality of FAIDs which collectively correct more error patterns than a single FAID on a given code. The collection of FAIDs utilized by the scheme is judiciously chosen to ensure that individual decoders have different decoding dynamics and correct different error patterns. Consequently, they can collectively correct a diverse set of error patterns, which is referred to as decoder diversity. We provide a systematic method to generate the set of FAIDs for decoder diversity on a given code based on the knowledge of the most harmful trapping sets present in the code.

Moreover, a study is carried on how to optimally operate and control an offshore MTdc network for integration of wind energy in the North Sea. An evolutionary strategy called covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) is employed to obtain optimal power flows inside the offshore network. The MTdc grid is composed of 19 nodes, interconnecting nine offshore wind farms to five European countries. The optimal power flow results obtained from the CMA algorithm are tested in a dynamic simulation model to check the control strategy performance in different case studies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Flow Control of VSC-Based Multiterminal DC Network for Offshore Wind Integration in the North Sea","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2281917","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/6646135/06600728.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2281917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6646135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Flow Control of VSC-Based Multiterminal DC Network for Offshore Wind Integration in the North Sea","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6600728/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13875637","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Flow Control of VSC-Based Multiterminal DC Network for Offshore Wind Integration in the North Sea","sourcePdf":"jestpe-rodrigues-2281917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121897S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6646135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6646135","articleId":"6600728","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600730,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Giddings","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Bangor University, Bangor, U.K."],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Giddings","id":"37392679000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"6600730","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1359},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this paper, key aspects associated with realizing real-time digital signal processing (DSP)-based optical transceivers for use in future optical access networks are considered.

Among several options, load-adaptive network operation-where the provided network capacity is coupled dynamically to the temporally fluctuating traffic characteristics-is a prominent and promising opportunity to improve network energy efficiency. General principles of load-adaptive network operation regimes are presented for a universal broadband operator network and their effects to network energy efficiency are explored. Based on a structure model of a telecommunication network, techniques for adjusting the capacity load-adaptively in different network sections are discussed with respect to the energy-saving potential, the current status and the challenges for application in networks ahead. Operator network sections as well as customer networks are covered; double-digit percentages of energy savings per network section are obtained in load-adaptive operation regimes as compared to the conventional network operation. When applying all those techniques in a holistic view to current realistic large operator networks, the double-digit per-section improvements transform into a significantly lower overall energy saving potential: This is caused by large parts of legacy network equipment forming a base electrical load not amenable to load-adaptive operation. When coupling the power consumption of networks to the temporally and spatially varying traffic demands in load-adaptive regimes their currently very predictable power draw behavior changes and may have significant effects in the interplay with power utilities in the upcoming Smart Energy transformation.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6701330/06600747.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"590","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2281879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2281879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency of Load-Adaptively Operated Telecommunication Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency of Load-Adaptively Operated Telecommunication Networks","htmlLink":"/document/6600747/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14021121","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency of Load-Adaptively Operated Telecommunication Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-lange-2281879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123415S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6701330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6701330","articleId":"6600747","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6600748,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Q.

While an OCC-CDMA system indeed offers ideal correlation properties, its capacity is strictly constrained by the number of element codes each user may use. In this paper, we suggest to use in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) column-wise complementary (IQCC) codes to implement a CDMA system to support 2M users, where M stands for the number of element codes in a flock of IQCC codes assigned to a user. The IQCC codes were designed to fit quadrature phase-shift keying modulation, where odd and even chips can be transmitted via I and Q carriers. We analyze correlation properties of the IQCC codes and introduce a CDMA system design based on the codes. The analytical results show that out-of-phase autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions are zero for any relative time shifts. Thus, a CDMA system implemented by the IQCC codes has an inherent capability to mitigate multiple access interference and multipath interference.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2013.2280070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7053977/06600749.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2013.2280070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7053977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"I/Q Column-Wise Complementary Codes for Interference-Resistant CDMA Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600749/","displayDocTitle":"I/Q Column-Wise Complementary Codes for Interference-Resistant CDMA Communication Systems","volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14965214","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600749/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China under","grantNumber":"2012-ZX03004003"},{"fundingName":"Taiwan National Science Council under","grantNumber":"NSC99-2221-E-006-016-MY3"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Key Laboratory of Wireless Wideband Communication and Signal Processing"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"I/Q Column-Wise Complementary Codes for Interference-Resistant CDMA Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-chen-2280070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080914S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7053977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7053977","articleId":"6600749","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6600769,"authors":[{"name":"Nasser N.

In this paper, a simple yet quite powerful feature extraction method based on image fusion and recursive filtering (IFRF) is proposed. First, the hyperspectral image is partitioned into multiple subsets of adjacent hyperspectral bands. Then, the bands in each subset are fused together by averaging, which is one of the simplest image fusion methods. Finally, the fused bands are processed with transform domain recursive filtering to get the resulting features for classification. Experiments are performed on different hyperspectral images, with the support vector machines (SVMs) serving as the classifier. By using the proposed method, the accuracy of the SVM classifier can be improved significantly. Furthermore, compared with other hyperspectral classification methods, the proposed IFRF method shows outstanding performance in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Extraction of Hyperspectral Images With Image Fusion and Recursive Filtering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2275613","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6750066/06600779.pdf","startPage":"3742","endPage":"3752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2275613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Feature Extraction of Hyperspectral Images With Image Fusion and Recursive Filtering","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6600779/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14131174","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172161"},{"fundingName":"Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate"},{"fundingName":"Rector Scholarship of Hunan University for Excellent Doctoral Student"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Scholarship Award for Excellent Doctoral Student"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Extraction of Hyperspectral Images With Image Fusion and Recursive Filtering","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2275613-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140793S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6750066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"6750066","articleId":"6600779","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6600783,"authors":[{"name":"Jiabin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Jiabin Wang (SM\u201903) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhengjiang, China, in 1982 and 1986, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of East London, London, U.K., in 1996, all in electrical and electronic engineering.","He is currently a Professor of electrical engineering with the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K. From 1986 to 1991, he was with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, where he was appointed a Lecturer in 1987 and an Associated Professor in 1990.

However, the complex composition of tissues and organs in the human body poses a challenge for many material decomposition methods, which assume the presence of only two, or at most three, materials in the mixture. We developed a flexible, model-based method that extends dual-energy CT's core material decomposition capability to handle more complex situations, in which it is necessary to disambiguate among and quantify the concentration of a larger number of materials. The proposed method, named multi-material decomposition (MMD), was used to develop two image analysis algorithms. The first was virtual unenhancement (VUE), which digitally removes the effect of contrast agents from contrast-enhanced dual-energy CT exams. VUE has the ability to reduce patient dose and improve clinical workflow, and can be used in a number of clinical applications such as CT urography and CT angiography. The second algorithm developed was liver-fat quantification (LFQ), which accurately quantifies the fat concentration in the liver from dual-energy CT exams. LFQ can form the basis of a clinical application targeting the diagnosis and treatment of fatty liver disease. Using image data collected from a cohort consisting of 50 patients and from phantoms, the application of MMD to VUE and LFQ yielded quantitatively accurate results when compared against gold standards. Furthermore, consistent results were obtained across all phases of imaging (contrast-free and contrast-enhanced). This is of particular importance since most clinical protocols for abdominal imaging with CT call for multi-phase imaging. We conclude that MMD can successfully form the basis of a number of dual-energy CT image analysis algorithms, and has the potential to improve the clinical utility of dual-energy CT in disease management.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2013.2281719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6697885/06600785.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6697885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2013.2281719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Method for Multi-Material Decomposition of Dual-Energy CT Images","volume":"33","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600785/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998088","pubMedId":"24058018","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600785/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Method for Multi-Material Decomposition of Dual-Energy CT Images","sourcePdf":"tmi-mendonca-2281719-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.252164S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6697885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6697885","articleId":"6600785","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6600792,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The use of magnetorheological (MR) dampers has been of increasing interest in smart structures as they have reliable, stable and fail-safe operations, small energy requirements, and fast responses. The challenges of MR damper structural control rest with the complex dynamics involved, high nonlinearity due to the force-velocity hysteresis, nonaffinity, and constraints of the control system with the magnetization current as its input. To address these problems, this paper presents the modeling and control design as well as the implementation results of a second-order sliding mode controller for the MR dampers embedded in the building structures subject to quake-induced vibrations. Based on the static hysteresis model of the MR damper using computationally tractable algebraic expressions, algorithms are proposed to control directly the magnetization current to the dampers, configured in a differential mode to counteract the offset force. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified in simulation by using a building model under quake-like excitations. The experimental results are provided on a laboratorial setup tested on a shake table.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback control","Intelligent structures","Vibrations","Sliding mode control","Earthquakes","Hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buildings (structures)","control system synthesis","earthquake engineering","hysteresis","intelligent structures","magnetisation","magnetorheology","shock absorbers","variable structure systems","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart structures","current-driven MR dampers","second-order sliding mode control","mechanical structures","external dynamic loadings","vibration shocks","destructive waves","magnetorheological dampers","fail-safe operations","energy requirements","MR damper structural control","complex dynamics","force-velocity hysteresis","control system constraints","magnetization current","control design","building structures","quake-induced vibrations","static hysteresis model","computationally tractable algebraic expressions","building model","quake-like excitations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Earthquakes","magnetorheological (MR) damper","modeling and control","second-order sliding mode (SOSM)","smart structures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2013.2280282","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/6681918/06600792.pdf","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2013.2280282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Structures With Current-Driven MR Dampers: Modeling and Second-Order Sliding Mode Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart Structures With Current-Driven MR Dampers: Modeling and Second-Order Sliding Mode Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600792/","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600792/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13969630","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Structures With Current-Driven MR Dampers: Modeling and Second-Order Sliding Mode Control","sourcePdf":"tmech-ha-2280282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068979S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6681918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6681918","articleId":"6600792","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6600794,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Arif","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Arif","id":"37588475800"},{"name":"Swakshar Ray","affiliation":["GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Swakshar","lastName":"Ray","id":"37381149800"},{"name":"Balarko Chaudhuri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Balarko","lastName":"Chaudhuri","id":"37272488000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"6600794","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":763},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"The objective of this brief is to design a measurement-based self-tuning controller, which does not rely on accurate models and deals with nonlinearities in system response. A special form of neural network (NN) model called feedback linearizable NN (FLNN) compatible with feedback linearization technique is proposed for representation of nonlinear power systems behavior. Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) is applied in batch mode to improve the model estimation. A time-varying feedback linearization controller (FBLC) is employed in conjunction with the FLNN-LM estimator to generate the control signal. Validation of the performance of proposed algorithm is done through the modeling and simulating both normal and heavy loading of transmission lines, when the nonlinearities are pronounced. Case studies on a large-scale 16-machine five-area power system are reported for different power flow scenarios, to prove the superiority of proposed scheme against a conventional model-based controller. A coefficient vector \u039b for FBLC is derived and used online at each time instant, to enhance the damping performance of controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Vectors","Artificial neural networks","Estimation","Oscillators","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","feedback","large-scale systems","linearisation techniques","multivariable control systems","neurocontrollers","power transmission control","self-adjusting systems","time-varying systems","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariable self-tuning feedback linearization controller","power oscillation damping","measurement-based self-tuning controller design","control nonlinearities","system response","NN model","feedback linearizable neural network","feedback linearization technique","nonlinear power system behavior","Levenberg-Marquardt","batch mode","model estimation","time-varying feedback linearization controller","FBLC","FLNN-LM estimator","control signal generation","transmission line","large-scale 16-machine five-area power system","power flow scenario","model-based controller","coefficient vector","damping performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedback linearizable neural networks (FLNNs)","feedback linearization controller (FBLC)","online estimation","power systems","self-tuning control."]},{"kwd":["Feedback linearizable neural networks (FLNNs)","feedback linearization controller (FBLC)","online estimation","power systems","self-tuning control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCST.2013.2279939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/6835146/06600794.pdf","startPage":"1519","endPage":"1526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6835146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2013.2279939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariable Self-Tuning Feedback Linearization Controller for Power Oscillation Damping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multivariable Self-Tuning Feedback Linearization Controller for Power Oscillation Damping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600794/","volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600794/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14396537","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariable Self-Tuning Feedback Linearization Controller for Power Oscillation Damping","sourcePdf":"tcst-arif-2279939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103853S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6835146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6835146","articleId":"6600794","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6600798,"authors":[{"name":"Hien Van Nguyen","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6609090/6600798/6600798-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hien Van Nguyen (M'08) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, and University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, USA, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

Therefore, the transmission bitrate of multi-view video requires more bandwidth than conventional multimedia. In order to reduce the bandwidth requirement, User Dependent Multi-view Video Transmission (UDMVT), which is based on Multi-view Video Coding (MVC), has been proposed for single users. In UDMVT, the same frames are encoded into different versions for each user, which increases the transmission bitrate for multiple users because of the redundant transmission of overlapping frames. In order to address this problem, we proposed User dependent Multi-view video Streaming for Multi-users (UMSM). UMSM possesses two characteristics: overlapping frames required by multiple users are transmitted only once by multicast while un-overlapping frames required by each user are transmitted by unicast and offset of video requests between multiple users is aligned so as to maximize the area of overlapping frames. UMSM achieves a low transmission bitrate of multi-view video for multiple users by means of combining these characteristics. To investigate the effect of user's view switching on traffic reduction, we design three types of view-switching models, namely, scanning model, random model, and watching model. Simulation results obtained using benchmark test sequences provided by MERL reveal that UMSM decreases the transmission bitrate by 80.6% on average for five users, as compared to MVC, when users gaze a viewpoint for a while after switching views in order to search an attractive viewpoint.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2281588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6683077/06600799.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2281588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6683077","startPage":"228","endPage":"241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UMSM: A Traffic Reduction Method on Multi-View Video Streaming for Multiple Users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"UMSM: A Traffic Reduction Method on Multi-View Video Streaming for Multiple Users","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13972903","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6600799/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UMSM: A Traffic Reduction Method on Multi-View Video Streaming for Multiple Users","sourcePdf":"tmm-fujihashi-2281588-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077648S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6683077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6683077","articleId":"6600799","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6600802,"authors":[{"name":"Aly El Gamal","affiliation":["Nile University, Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Cairo, Egypt"],"bio":{"p":["Aly El Gamal (S'09) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from Cairo University, Cairo, in 2007, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nile University, Cairo, in 2009, the M.S. degree in Mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 2013, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.","He worked as an intern in the Office of the Chief Scientist Department of Qualcomm Inc., in 2012.

The new regions are shown to be strictly larger than the known ones for a wide class of discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels. In the half-duplex case, where a user can only transmit or receive on any given degree of freedom, the idea of randomized scheduling is introduced and shown to offer a significant gain in terms of the achievable secrecy sum-rate.

Great efforts have been paid to develop SBD algorithms for years. However, the high computational cost in the SBD becomes a block for further applications such as video indexing, browsing, retrieval, and representation. Motivated by the requirement of the real-time interactive applications, a unified fast SBD scheme is proposed in this paper. We adopted a candidate segment selection and singular value decomposition (SVD) to speed up the SBD. Initially, the positions of the shot boundaries and lengths of gradual transitions are predicted using adaptive thresholds and most non-boundary frames are discarded at the same time. Only the candidate segments that may contain the shot boundaries are preserved for further detection. Then, for all frames in each candidate segment, their color histograms in the hue-saturation-value) space are extracted, forming a frame-feature matrix. The SVD is then performed on the frame-feature matrices of all candidate segments to reduce the feature dimension. The refined feature vector of each frame in the candidate segments is obtained as a new metric for boundary detection. Finally, cut and gradual transitions are identified using our pattern matching method based on a new similarity measurement. Experiments on TRECVID 2001 test data and other video materials show that the proposed scheme can achieve a high detection speed and excellent accuracy compared with recent SBD schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2282081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6609090/06600811.pdf","startPage":"5136","endPage":"5145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2282081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Video Shot Boundary Detection Based on SVD and Pattern Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600811/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Video Shot Boundary Detection Based on SVD and Pattern Matching","volume":"22","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13821682","pubMedId":"24058028","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600811/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Video Shot Boundary Detection Based on SVD and Pattern Matching","sourcePdf":"tip-lu-2282081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095538S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6609090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6609090","articleId":"6600811","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6600822,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Jacques","affiliation":["ISPGroup, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Jacques","id":"38579243500"},{"name":"David K.

In such cases, remeasurement and quantization of the reconstructed signal do not necessarily match the initial observations, showing that the whole QCS model is not consistent. Our approach considers instead that quantization distortion more closely resembles heteroscedastic uniform noise, with variance depending on the observed quantization bin. Generalizing our previous work on uniform quantization, we show that for nonuniform quantizers described by the \u201ccompander\u201d formalism, quantization distortion may be better characterized as having bounded weighted \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-norm (p \u2265 2), for a particular weighting. We develop a new reconstruction approach, termed Generalized Basis Pursuit DeNoise (GBPDN), which minimizes the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm of the signal to reconstruct constrained by this weighted \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-norm fidelity. We prove that, for standard Gaussian sensing matrices and K sparse or compressible signals in R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</sup>\n with at least \u03a9((K logN/K)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p/2</sup>\n) measurements, i.e., under strongly oversampled QCS scenario, GBPDN is \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-\u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n instance optimal and stable recovers all such sparse or compressible signals. The reconstruction error decreases as O(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-B</sup>\n/\u221a(p+1)) given a budget of B bits per measurement. This yields a reduction by a factor \u221a(p+1) of the reconstruction error compared to the one produced by \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-norm constrained decoders. We also propose an primal-dual proximal splitting scheme to solve the GBPDN program which is efficient for large-scale problems. Interestingly, extensive simulations testing the GBPDN effectiveness confirm the trend predicted by the theory, that the reconstruction error can indeed be reduced by increasing p, but this is achieved at a much less stringent oversampling regime than the one expected by the theoretical bounds. Besides the QCS scenario, we also show that GBPDN applies straightforwardly to the related case of CS measurements corrupted by heteroscedastic generalized Gaussian noise with provable reconstruction error reduction.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2281815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6670132/06600822.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2281815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670132","startPage":"7969","endPage":"7984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilizing Nonuniformly Quantized Compressed Sensing With Scalar Companders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing Nonuniformly Quantized Compressed Sensing With Scalar Companders","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914275","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing Nonuniformly Quantized Compressed Sensing With Scalar Companders","sourcePdf":"tit-jacques-2281815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045415S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6670132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","articleId":"6600822","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6600823,"authors":[{"name":"Roger P.

Algorithms are typically optimized for a targeted tissue contrast obtained from a particular implementation of a pulse sequence on a specific scanner. There are many practical situations, including multi-institution trials, rapid emergency scans, and scientific use of historical data, where the images are not acquired according to an optimal protocol or the desired tissue contrast is entirely missing. This paper introduces an image restoration technique that recovers images with both the desired tissue contrast and a normalized intensity profile. This is done using patches in the acquired images and an atlas containing patches of the acquired and desired tissue contrasts. The method is an example-based approach relying on sparse reconstruction from image patches. Its performance in demonstrated using several examples, including image intensity normalization, missing tissue contrast recovery, automatic segmentation, and multimodal registration. These examples demonstrate potential practical uses and also illustrate limitations of our approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2013.2282126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6675089/06600832.pdf","startPage":"2348","endPage":"2363","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2013.2282126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Resonance Image Example-Based Contrast Synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Resonance Image Example-Based Contrast Synthesis","volume":"32","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6600832/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13933936","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","pubMedId":"24058022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Resonance Image Example-Based Contrast Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tmi-carass-2282126-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126502S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6675089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6675089","articleId":"6600832","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6600837,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Karshenas","affiliation":["Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6866949/6600837/karsh-2281524-small.gif","p":["Hossein Karshenas received the B.E. degree in computer engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran, in 2006, and the M.E. degree in artificial intelligence and robotics from the Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009.

In this way, it can capture the dependencies between objectives, variables and objectives, as well as the dependencies learned between variables in other Bayesian network-based EDAs. This model leads to a problem decomposition that helps the proposed algorithm find better tradeoff solutions to the multiobjective problem. In addition to Pareto set approximation, the algorithm is also able to estimate the structure of the multiobjective problem. To apply the algorithm to many-objective problems, the algorithm includes four different ranking methods proposed in the literature for this purpose. The algorithm is first applied to the set of walking fish group problems, and its optimization performance is compared with a standard multiobjective evolutionary algorithm and another competitive multiobjective EDA. The experimental results show that on several of these problems, and for different objective space dimensions, the proposed algorithm performs significantly better and on some others achieves comparable results when compared with the other two algorithms. The algorithm is then tested on the set of CEC09 problems, where the results show that multiobjective optimization based on joint model estimation is able to obtain considerably better fronts for some of the problems compared with the search based on conventional genetic operators in the state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281524","startPage":"519","endPage":"542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6866949","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6866949/06600837.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Estimation of Distribution Algorithm Based on Joint Modeling of Objectives and Variables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600837/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Estimation of Distribution Algorithm Based on Joint Modeling of Objectives and Variables","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6600837/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14485698","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Consolider Ingenio","grantNumber":"2010-CSD2007-00018, TIN2010-20900-C04-04 and TIN2010-14931"},{"fundingName":"Cajal Blue Brain projects (Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation)"},{"fundingName":"Saiotek and Research Groups 2007\u20132012 (IT-242-07) Programs (Basque Government)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Estimation of Distribution Algorithm Based on Joint Modeling of Objectives and Variables","sourcePdf":"tevc-karshenas-2281524-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152653S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6866949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6866949","articleId":"6600837","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6600845,"authors":[{"name":"Christer M.

The method enables, due to its low computational cost, optimization of PA efficiency and bandwidth in a complex design space involving two independent inputs. Under the idealized assumption of short-circuited higher harmonics, the analysis is used to prove the existence of a Doherty-outphasing continuum, featuring high average efficiency over 100% fractional bandwidth. With this result as a foundation, a combiner incorporating microwave transistor parasitics is analyzed without assuming short-circuited higher harmonics, showing that high average efficiencies are also achievable under more realistic conditions. A PA is straightforwardly designed from these calculation results using two 15-W GaN HEMTs. The simulated layout-ready (large-signal transistor model) PA average drain efficiency exceeds 50% over 1.1-3.7 GHz for a 6.7-dB peak-to-average power-ratio WCDMA signal. The measured PA has a maximum output power of 44 \u00b10.9 dBm and a 6-dB output power back-off (OPBO) power-added efficiency (PAE) of 45% over 1-3 GHz. After applying digital pre-distortion, excellent linearity is demonstrated when transmitting the WCDMA signal, resulting in an adjacent channel leakage power ratio lower than -57 dBc with corresponding average PAE of 50% and 40% at 1.2 and 2.3 GHz, respectively. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the most wideband OPBO efficiency enhanced PA reported to date, proving the effectiveness of employing linear multi-harmonic analysis in dual-input PA design.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2280562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6617737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2280562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6617737/06600845.pdf","startPage":"3743","endPage":"3752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1\u20133-GHz Digitally Controlled Dual-RF Input Power-Amplifier Design Based on a Doherty-Outphasing Continuum Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A 1\u20133-GHz Digitally Controlled Dual-RF Input Power-Amplifier Design Based on a Doherty-Outphasing Continuum Analysis","volume":"61","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600845/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796752","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600845/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1\u20133-GHz Digitally Controlled Dual-RF Input Power-Amplifier Design Based on a Doherty-Outphasing Continuum Analysis","sourcePdf":"tmtt-andersson-2280562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076167S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6617737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6617737","articleId":"6600845","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6600846,"authors":[{"name":"Dejan Vukobratovi\u0107","affiliation":["Dept. of Power, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dejan","lastName":"Vukobratovi\u0107","id":"37567276900"},{"name":"Chadi Khirallah","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Chadi","lastName":"Khirallah","id":"37268478400"},{"name":"Vladimir Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Stankovi\u0107","id":"37392809100"},{"name":"John S.

In the past when both precoder and bit loading are fed back to the transmitter, the feedback rate is often allocated between the two using an ad hoc approach and codebooks are designed separately rather than jointly. In this paper we allocate feedback rate in a systematic manner by analyzing the effect of quantization on transmission power. The analysis allows us to obtain the rate allocation that minimizes the power penalty due to limited feedback. As both precoder and bit loading are fed back to the transmitter, the information embedded in one can be exploited for the design of the other. To take advantage of bit loading feedback, which carries valuable information on the importance of individual subchannels, we employ multiple precoder codebooks, each tailored to a bit loading vector in the bit loading codebook. The multi-codebook scheme enjoys significant gain over the single-codebook case that does not take bit loading feedback into consideration. Simulations are given to demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve a very good performance due to carefully designed feedback rate allocation and joint codebook designs.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2281785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6648447/06600848.pdf","startPage":"6091","endPage":"6102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2281785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited Feedback of Precoder and Bit Loading for MIMO Systems: A Joint Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600848/","displayDocTitle":"Limited Feedback of Precoder and Bit Loading for MIMO Systems: A Joint Design","volume":"61","issue":"23","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13875266","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600848/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited Feedback of Precoder and Bit Loading for MIMO Systems: A Joint Design","sourcePdf":"tsp-lin-2281785-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120103S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6648447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6648447","articleId":"6600848","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600851,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6866949/6600851/deb-2281535-small.gif","p":["Kalyanmoy Deb (F'12) is the Koenig Endowed Chair Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.

In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281535","startPage":"577","endPage":"601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6866949/06600851.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6866949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point-Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part I: Solving Problems With Box Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point-Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part I: Solving Problems With Box Constraints","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2014","accessionNumber":"14485700","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6600851/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point-Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part I: Solving Problems With Box Constraints","sourcePdf":"tevc-deb-2281535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150723S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6866949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"2008","xplore-issue":"6866949","articleId":"6600851","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6600856,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Petrolati","affiliation":["European Space Agency (ESA), European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6782669/6600856/6600856-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniele Petrolati received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering (summa cum laude) and the M.Sc.

The basic idea of the proposed approach is to reserve some sampling instants for estimating and tracking the mismatch parameters of sub-ADCs with reference to a known input. Since the estimation problem is analogous to a standard system identification problem, we propose two simple variable digital filter (VDF) based adaptive filter structures which are derived from the least mean squares (LMS) and normalized LMS algorithms. On the other hand, the reservation of some sampling instants in the normal operation of TI ADC implies that part of samples have to be sacrificed. Based on a general time-varying linear system model for the mismatch and the spectral property of a slightly oversampled input signal, we also propose a novel iterative framework to solve the resulting underdetermined problem. It not only embraces a number of iterative algorithms for the tradeoff between convergence rate and arithmetic complexity but also admits efficient update structure based again on VDFs. Therefore, thanks to the well-known efficient implementation of VDFs, the adaptability of both estimation and compensation algorithms allows us to combine them seamlessly to form an online calibration structure, which is able to track and compensate for the channel mismatches with low complexity and high reconstruction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by means of computer simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Iterative Structure for Online Calibration of --channel Time-Interleaved ADCs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2013.2278574","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6701346/06600866.pdf","startPage":"312","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2013.2278574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600866/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Iterative Structure for Online Calibration of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex></formula>-channel Time-Interleaved ADCs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6600866/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13997869","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Iterative Structure for Online Calibration of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex></formula>-channel Time-Interleaved ADCs","sourcePdf":"tim-chan-2278574-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135259S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6701346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6701346","articleId":"6600866","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6600869,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Peng","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China","School of Electrical and Automation Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6915776/6600869/6600869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Peng received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Chinese University of Mining Technology, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.","From September 2002 to August 2004, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in applied math with Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.

Because of the introduction of a communication network, the favorable property in the point-to-point connection, that is, sharing the identical premises in the fuzzy plant and the fuzzy controllers cannot be arbitrarily employed. To widen the applicability of the fuzzy control method under network environments, a novel method is provided to reconstruct the synchronous time scale grades of membership at the controller as those in the plant. As a result, the aforementioned favorable property can be conditionally used in the derivation of the stability and stabilization criteria for the system under consideration controlled over a communication network.

Raw reactants are diluted in this process to achieve given target concentrations. A bioassay may require several different target concentrations of a reactant. Both the dilution operation count and the reactant usage can be minimized if multiple target concentrations are considered simultaneously during sample preparation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a multitarget sample preparation algorithm that extensively exploits the ideas of waste recycling and intermediate droplet sharing to reduce both reactant usage and waste amount for digital microfluidic biochips. Experimental results show that our waste recycling algorithm can reduce the waste and operation count by 48% and 37%, respectively, as compared to an existing state-of-the-art multitarget sample preparation method if the number of target concentrations is ten. The reduction can be up to 97% and 73% when the number of target concentrations goes even higher.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactant and Waste Minimization in Multitarget Sample Preparation on Digital Microfluidic Biochips","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2263035","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6600826/06600878.pdf","startPage":"1484","endPage":"1494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2263035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6600826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Reactant and Waste Minimization in Multitarget Sample Preparation on Digital Microfluidic Biochips","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6600878/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13766487","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactant and Waste Minimization in Multitarget Sample Preparation on Digital Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tcad-liu-2263035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080675S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6600826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6600826","articleId":"6600878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":6600882,"authors":[{"name":"Hung M.

Bridges deteriorate with time as a result of material aging, excessive loading, environmental effects, and inadequate maintenance. The current practice of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of bridge decks cannot meet the increasing demands for highly efficient, cost-effective, and safety-guaranteed inspection and evaluation. In this paper, a mechatronic systems design for an autonomous robotic system for highly efficient bridge deck inspection and evaluation is presented. An autonomous holonomic mobile robot is used as a platform to carry various NDE sensing systems for simultaneous and fast data collection. The robot's NDE sensor suite includes ground penetrating radar arrays, acoustic/seismic arrays, electrical resistivity sensors, and video cameras. Besides the NDE sensors, the robot is also equipped with various onboard navigation sensors such as global positioning system (GPS), inertial measurement units (IMU), laser scanner, etc. An integration scheme is presented to fuse the measurements from the GPS, the IMU and the wheel encoders for high-accuracy robot localization.

The primary problem is significant voltage rise in the feeder that forces existing voltage control devices such as on-load tap-changers and line voltage regulators to operate continuously. The consequence is the deterioration of the operating life of the voltage control mechanism. Also, conventional non-coordinated reactive power control can result in the operation of the line regulator at its control limit (runaway condition). This paper proposes an optimal reactive power coordination strategy based on the load and irradiance forecast. The objective is to minimize the number of tap operations so as not to reduce the operating life of the tap control mechanism and avoid runaway. The proposed objective is achieved by coordinating various reactive power control options in the distribution network while satisfying constraints such as maximum power point tracking of PV and voltage limits of the feeder. The option of voltage support from PV plant is also considered. The problem is formulated as constrained optimization and solved through the interior point technique. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in a realistic distribution network model.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2279721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6684613/06600912.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2279721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution Voltage Control Considering the Impact of PV Generation on Tap Changers and Autonomous Regulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600912/","displayDocTitle":"Distribution Voltage Control Considering the Impact of PV Generation on Tap Changers and Autonomous Regulators","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13973480","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600912/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution Voltage Control Considering the Impact of PV Generation on Tap Changers and Autonomous Regulators","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-pal-2279721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097188S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6684613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"6684613","articleId":"6600912","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6600915,"authors":[{"name":"Rami A.

The hardware overhead is 12.4%-27.3%, and the throughput is 1.2-23 Gbps, depending on the AES architecture, FPGA family, and detection latency. The performance overhead ranges from 10% to 100% depending on the security level. Moreover, the proposed technique can be integrated into various block cipher modes of operation.

The aim of this letter is to extend it to a larger family of distributions, namely elliptically contoured (EC) distributions. More precisely, we derive a closed-form expression of the FIM in this case. This new expression involves the usual term of the Gaussian FIM plus some corrective factors that depend only on the expectations of some functions of the so-called modular variate. Hence, for most distributions in the EC family, derivation of the FIM from its Gaussian counterpart involves slight additional derivations.

In this paper, we describe a routability-driven placer called Ripple. Each step, including global placement, legalization, and detailed placement, is made to trade-off between routability and wirelength. We propose a robust and effective flow by using cell inflation to relieve routing congestion. Cell inflation has traditionally been used to deal with congestion and we will discuss how this technique can be used easily and robustly in the global placement. Besides, unlike many previous works that focus on different types of swapping strategies, we analyze and propose some simple and effective approaches when considering routability in the legalization and detailed placement steps. Experimental results show that Ripple is particularly effective in improving routability. When compared to the top results in the ISPD 2011 Contest and SimPLR, Ripple can obtain the smallest overflow and half-perimeter wirelength on average, while the congestion hot spots are also distributed sparsely in Ripple.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2265371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6600826/06600938.pdf","startPage":"1546","endPage":"1556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2265371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6600826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ripple: A Robust and Effective Routability-Driven Placer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Ripple: A Robust and Effective Routability-Driven Placer","volume":"32","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13766491","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600938/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600938/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ripple: A Robust and Effective Routability-Driven Placer","sourcePdf":"tcad-he-2265371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096091S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6600826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6600826","articleId":"6600938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600939,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, US"],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278653500"},{"name":"H.

In this paper, we propose an automatic approach for segmenting the left atrium from magnetic resonance imagery. The segmentation problem is formulated as a problem in variational region growing. In particular, the method starts locally by searching for a seed region of the left atrium from an MR slice. A global constraint is imposed by applying a shape prior to the left atrium represented by Zernike moments. The overall growing process is guided by the robust statistics of intensities from the seed region along with the shape prior to capture the entire atrial region. The robustness and accuracy of our approach are demonstrated by experimental results from 64 human MR images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13821680","pubMedId":"24058026","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6600944/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Segmentation of the Left Atrium From MR Images via Variational Region Growing With a Moments-Based Shape Prior","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Segmentation of the Left Atrium From MR Images via Variational Region Growing With a Moments-Based Shape Prior","sourcePdf":"tip-zhu-2282049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101097S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6609090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6609090","articleId":"6600944","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6600952,"authors":[{"name":"Juho Park","affiliation":["ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6648447/6600952/6600952-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juho Park (S'06\u2013M'13) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, all in electrical engineering in 2006, 2008, and 2013, respectively.","He is currently working at the B4G research team in the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon.

It is shown that any Pareto-optimal transmit signal covariance matrix at a transmitter should have its column space contained in the union of the signal spaces of the channel matrices from the transmitter to all receivers. Based on this necessary condition, an efficient parameterization for the beam search space is proposed. The proposed parameterization is given by the product manifold of a Stiefel manifold and a subset of a hyperplane and enables us to construct an efficient beam design algorithm by exploiting its rich geometrical structure and existing tools for optimization on Stiefel manifolds. Reduction in the beam search space dimension and computational complexity by the proposed parameterization and the proposed beam design approach is significant when the number of transmit antennas is much larger than the sum of the numbers of receive antennas, as in upcoming cellular networks adopting massive MIMO technologies. Numerical results validate the proposed parameterization and the proposed cooperative beam design method based on the proposed parameterization for MIMO interference channels.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2281784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6648447/06600952.pdf","startPage":"5932","endPage":"5946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2281784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Pareto-Optimal Beam Structure and Design for Multi-User MIMO Interference Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600952/","displayDocTitle":"On the Pareto-Optimal Beam Structure and Design for Multi-User MIMO Interference Channels","volume":"61","issue":"23","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13875258","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600952/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Pareto-Optimal Beam Structure and Design for Multi-User MIMO Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-sung-2281784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126058S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6648447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"11","articleId":"6600952","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600956,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Shen","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6878499/6600956/6600956-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Shen (S'05) received the B.S. degree (with highest honor) in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2005, and the S.M. degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2008, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at MIT.","Since 2005, he has been a Research Assistant with the Wireless Communications and Network Science Laboratory, MIT.

In range-based localization, the position of the object can be inferred using the distance measurements from wireless signals exchanged with active objects or reflected by passive ones. Power allocation for ranging signals is important since it affects not only network lifetime and throughput but also localization accuracy. In this paper, we establish a unifying optimization framework for power allocation in both active and passive localization networks. In particular, we first determine the functional properties of the localization accuracy metric, which enable us to transform the power allocation problems into second-order cone programs (SOCPs). We then propose the robust counterparts of the problems in the presence of parameter uncertainty and develop asymptotically optimal and efficient near-optimal SOCP-based algorithms. Our simulation results validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms .","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2013.2278984","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/6878499/06600956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2013.2278984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6878499","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Optimization for Network Localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Optimization for Network Localization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14525800","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6600956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-12-0287"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-11-1-0397"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Optimization for Network Localization","sourcePdf":"tnet-shen-2278984-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126086S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6878499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"6878499","articleId":"6600956","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6600960,"authors":[{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Derong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277008500"},{"name":"Ding Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Wang","id":"37715514300"},{"name":"Hongliang Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongliang","lastName":"Li","id":"38467278700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"6600960","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":191,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1685},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Decentralized control","Cost function","Equations","Large-scale systems","Heuristic algorithms","Interconnected systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","approximation theory","continuous time systems","control system synthesis","decentralised control","dynamic programming","feedback","interconnected systems","iterative methods","learning systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","partial differential equations","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized stabilization","continuous-time nonlinear interconnected systems","neural-network-based online learning optimal control approach","decentralized control strategy","feedback gains","optimal control policies","isolated subsystems","online policy iteration algorithm","Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations","adaptive dynamic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive dynamic programming","decentralized control","large-scale systems","neural networks","nonlinear interconnected systems","optimal control","policy iteration","reinforcement learning"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, using a neural-network-based online learning optimal control approach, a novel decentralized control strategy is developed to stabilize a class of continuous-time nonlinear interconnected large-scale systems. First, optimal controllers of the isolated subsystems are designed with cost functions reflecting the bounds of interconnections. Then, it is proven that the decentralized control strategy of the overall system can be established by adding appropriate feedback gains to the optimal control policies of the isolated subsystems. Next, an online policy iteration algorithm is presented to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations related to the optimal control problem. Through constructing a set of critic neural networks, the cost functions can be obtained approximately, followed by the control policies. Furthermore, the dynamics of the estimation errors of the critic networks are verified to be uniformly and ultimately bounded. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the present decentralized control scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Stabilization for a Class of Continuous-Time Nonlinear Interconnected Systems Using Online Learning Optimal Control Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280013","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6709816/06600960.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6709816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Stabilization for a Class of Continuous-Time Nonlinear Interconnected Systems Using Online Learning Optimal Control Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14030376","pubMedId":"24807039","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61034002, 61233001 and 61273140"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Stabilization for a Class of Continuous-Time Nonlinear Interconnected Systems Using Online Learning Optimal Control Approach","sourcePdf":"tnnls-liu-2280013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056892S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","isNumber":"6709816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"191","articleId":"6600960","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6600965,"authors":[{"name":"Jalal Taghia","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Acoustics, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/6663728/6600965/6600965-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jalal Taghia received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Azad University, Ghazvin, Iran in 2006.

In this paper, we investigate the speech intelligibility prediction from the viewpoint of information theory and introduce novel objective intelligibility measures based on the estimated mutual information between the temporal envelopes of clean speech and processed speech in the subband domain. Mutual information allows to account for higher order statistics and hence to consider dependencies beyond the conventional second order statistics. Using data from three different listening tests it is shown that the proposed objective intelligibility measures provide promising results for speech intelligibility prediction in different scenarios of speech enhancement where speech is processed by non-linear modification strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2013.2281574","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6663728/06600965.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2013.2281574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Objective Intelligibility Measures Based on Mutual Information for Speech Subjected to Speech Enhancement Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600965/","displayDocTitle":"Objective Intelligibility Measures Based on Mutual Information for Speech Subjected to Speech Enhancement Processing","volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13914035","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600965/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Objective Intelligibility Measures Based on Mutual Information for Speech Subjected to Speech Enhancement Processing","sourcePdf":"tasl-taghia-2281574-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126364S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6663728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6663728","articleId":"6600965","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6600967,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwei Peng","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6701346/6600967/6600967-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiwei Peng (S'10\u2013M'12) was born in Changsha, China, in 1983.

The proposed FSSs are based on a two-dimensional (2-D) array of shielded microstrip lines with shorting via to ground, where two different resonators in the substrate are constructed based on the excited substrate mode. Furthermore, metallic plates of rectangular shape and \u201cT-type\u201d are inserted in the air region of shielded microstrip lines, which can introduce additional resonators provided by the air mode. Using this arrangement, a passband with two transmission poles can be obtained. Moreover, multiple transmission zeros outside the passband are produced for improving the out-of-band rejection. The operating principles of these FSSs are explained with the aid of equivalent circuit models. Two examples are designed, fabricated, and measured to verify the proposed structures and circuit models. Measured results demonstrate that the FSSs exhibit high out-of-band rejection and stable filtering response under a large variation of the incidence angle.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2279776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6617737/06600973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2279776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6617737","startPage":"3578","endPage":"3589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Bandpass Frequency-Selective Structures With Multiple Transmission Zeros","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Bandpass Frequency-Selective Structures With Multiple Transmission Zeros","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796755","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6600973/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Bandpass Frequency-Selective Structures With Multiple Transmission Zeros","sourcePdf":"tmtt-shen-2279776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081578S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6617737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6617737","articleId":"6600973","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6600979,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaud Vena","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Conception et d'Int\u00e9gration des Syst\u00e8mes (LCIS)/Grenoble Institute of Technology, Valence, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6675045/6600979/6600979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arnaud Vena (M'13) received the Eng.

In order to improve the area spectral efficiency of video transmission in cellular systems, small cells heterogeneous architectures (e.g., femtocells, WiFi off-loading) are being proposed, such that video traffic to nomadic users can be handled by short-range links to the nearest small cell access points (referred to as \u201chelpers\u201d). As the helper deployment density increases, the backhaul capacity becomes the system bottleneck. In order to alleviate such bottleneck we propose a system where helpers with low-rate backhaul but high storage capacity cache popular video files. Files not available from helpers are transmitted by the cellular base station. We analyze the optimum way of assigning files to the helpers, in order to minimize the expected downloading time for files. We distinguish between the uncoded case (where only complete files are stored) and the coded case, where segments of Fountain-encoded versions of the video files are stored at helpers. We show that the uncoded optimum file assignment is NP-hard, and develop a greedy strategy that is provably within a factor 2 of the optimum. Further, for a special case we provide an efficient algorithm achieving a provably better approximation ratio of 1-(1-1/d )\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sup>\n, where d is the maximum number of helpers a user can be connected to. We also show that the coded optimum cache assignment problem is convex that can be further reduced to a linear program. We present numerical results comparing the proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2281606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2281606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6670132/06600983.pdf","startPage":"8402","endPage":"8413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FemtoCaching: Wireless Content Delivery Through Distributed Caching Helpers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"FemtoCaching: Wireless Content Delivery Through Distributed Caching Helpers","volume":"59","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6600983/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914269","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600983/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FemtoCaching: Wireless Content Delivery Through Distributed Caching Helpers","sourcePdf":"tit-golrezaei-2281606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111985S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6670132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"774","xplore-issue":"6670132","articleId":"6600983","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6600986,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Yuan Chiang","affiliation":["Nanoscale Communication IC (NCIC) Laboratory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6617737/6600986/6600986-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei-Yuan Chiang (S'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in communication engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

Fabricated in a 0.13- \u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS process, the VCO achieves a tuning range of 3.5% and an output power of -7.2 dBm at 201.5 GHz. The dc power consumption of the VCO is 30 mW, resulting in a high dc to RF power efficiency of 0.6% and a figure of merit (FoMT) of -165, which is the highest FoM for any silicon-based VCO reported to date at this frequency range.

Multiple saliencies are considered, as well as saliency orientation shift according to loading conditions. These two nonideal phenomena severely degrade the performance of sensorless controls for induction machines. Multiple saliencies cause the position error signal to become distorted and make estimation of the rotor flux position difficult. Saliency orientation shift causes the estimated rotor flux position to drift from the actual rotor flux position, depending on the torque and speed. In this study, a sensorless algorithm based on square-wave voltage injection is adopted for induction machine control. When square-wave voltage is injected into the estimated synchronous reference frame, the harmonics of the error signal are lower than those of the conventional sinusoidal injection method. In addition, by injecting a square wave into the q-axis of the estimated synchronous reference frame instead of the d-axis, the saliency orientation shift is made smaller. Based on this study using square-wave voltage injection into the q-axis, the flux can be estimated with less error. Because of its enhanced rotor flux estimation performance, the proposed method provides better torque controllability than the conventional sinusoidal voltage injection method. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless Control for Induction Machines Based on Square-Wave Voltage Injection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2278103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6742621/06600987.pdf","startPage":"3637","endPage":"3645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2278103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless Control for Induction Machines Based on Square-Wave Voltage Injection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6600987/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14112095","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless Control for Induction Machines Based on Square-Wave Voltage Injection","sourcePdf":"tpel-yoon-2278103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070269S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6742621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6742621","articleId":"6600987","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6600989,"authors":[{"name":"Ailong Wu","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Institute for Information and System Science, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6763171/6600989/6600989-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ailong Wu received the Ph.D. degree in systems analysis and integration from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2013.","He has been a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Institute for Information and System Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, since 2013.

We design the optimal relay processing matrix to minimize the maximum per-antenna power budget for a received SNR target. With given transmit and receive beamformers at the source and destination, respectively, we first focus on the equivalent system with single-antenna source and destination. Although non-convex, we show that the optimization satisfies strong Lagrange duality and can be solved in the Lagrangian dual domain. We reveal a prominent structure of this problem, by establishing its duality with direct SIMO beamforming system with an uncertain noise. This enables us to derive a semi-closed form expression for the optimal relay processing matrix that depends on a set of dual variables, which can be determined through numerical optimization with a significantly reduced problem space. We further show that the dual problem has a semi-definite programming form, which enables efficient numerical optimization methods to determine the dual variables with polynomial complexity. Using this result, the reverse problem of SNR maximization under a set of relay per-antenna power constraints is then addressed. We then consider the maximum relay beamforming achievable rate under different combinations of antenna setups at source and destination. In particular, we generalize the duality to MIMO relay beamforming vs. direct MIMO beamforming, and establish the dual relation of the two systems for different multi-antenna setups at source and destination.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6600990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13887028","htmlLink":"/document/6600990/","displayDocTitle":"Unicast Multi-Antenna Relay Beamforming With Per-Antenna Power Control: Optimization and Duality","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unicast Multi-Antenna Relay Beamforming With Per-Antenna Power Control: Optimization and Duality","sourcePdf":"tsp-dong-2281778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12518S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6648447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6648447","articleId":"6600990","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6600994,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37069310900"},{"name":"Tarek A.

In order to avoid the huge number of repeated simulations in conventional Monte Carlo flows, this paper presents an intrusive spectral simulator for statistical circuit analysis. Our simulator employs the recently developed generalized polynomial chaos expansion to perform uncertainty quantification of nonlinear transistor circuits with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian random parameters. We modify the nonintrusive stochastic collocation (SC) method and develop an intrusive variant called stochastic testing (ST) method. Compared with the popular intrusive stochastic Galerkin (SG) method, the coupled deterministic equations resulting from our proposed ST method can be solved in a decoupled manner at each time point. At the same time, ST requires fewer samples and allows more flexible time step size controls than directly using a nonintrusive SC solver. These two properties make ST more efficient than SG and than existing SC methods, and more suitable for time-domain circuit simulation. Simulation results of several digital, analog and RF circuits are reported. Since our algorithm is based on generic mathematical models, the proposed ST algorithm can be applied to many other engineering problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Using the implicit function theorem and backstepping technique, a practical robust adaptive neural control scheme is proposed to guarantee that the tracking error converges to an adjusted neighborhood of the origin by choosing appropriate design parameters. In contrast to conventional Lyapunov-based design techniques, an alternative Lyapunov function is constructed for the development of control law and learning algorithms. Differing from the existing results in the literature, the control scheme does not need to compute the derivatives of virtual control signals at each step in backstepping design procedures. Furthermore, the scheme requires the desired trajectory and its first derivative rather than its first n derivatives. In addition, the useful property of the basis function of the radial basis function, which will be used in control design, is explored. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6763171/06601001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6763171","startPage":"718","endPage":"727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Neural Control for a Class of Uncertain Pure-Feedback Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel Neural Control for a Class of Uncertain Pure-Feedback Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14156851","pubMedId":"24807949","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6601001/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Neural Control for a Class of Uncertain Pure-Feedback Systems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-shen-2280728-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092134S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6763171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6763171","articleId":"6601001","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6601019,"authors":[{"name":"Larbi Talbi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Quebec in Outaouais, Gatineau, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6701346/6601019/6601019-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Larbi Talbi (S'95\u2013M'97\u2013SM'05) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada, in 1989 and 1994, respectively.","He is currently a Professor and the Director of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DCSE), University of Quebec in Outaouais, Gatineau, QC, Canada.

There is an increasing interest on how to construct fuzzy models for different types of complex systems such as highly nonlinear, large-scale, multiobjective, and high-dimensional systems. Current state of the art indicates the use of fast and scalable evolutionary algorithms in complex fuzzy modeling tasks. Genetic fuzzy systems offer an effective approach to embed genetic database learning and fast learning of parsimonious and accurate models. This paper suggests a participatory genetic learning approach as a tool for genetic fuzzy system modeling. Participatory genetic learning is an evolutionary computation paradigm in which the population itself plays an important role to assign fitness values to individuals. The approach uses compatibility between two randomly chosen individuals and the fittest to select the mates, and selective transfer recombination mechanism to exchange information between mates. Mutation is done similarly as in the canonical genetic algorithm. The usage of participatory learning, selective transfer, and mutation translates into a new type of genetic algorithm for genetic fuzzy system modeling. This paper focuses on the application of participatory genetic learning for rule-based fuzzy modeling of regression problems. Actual data concerning an electric system maintenance problem and results reported in the literature are employed to evaluate the performance of participatory genetic learning. The mean squared error and number of rules measure modeling accuracy and complexity, respectively. The result shows that participatory genetic learning produces accurate, parsimonious models, and is fast when compared with current state of the art approaches.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetics","Fuzzy systems","Sociology","Statistics","Genetic algorithms","Linear programming","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["participatory genetic learning","genetic fuzzy system modeling","evolutionary algorithm","evolutionary computation paradigm","canonical genetic algorithm","rule-based fuzzy modeling","regression problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Participatory Learning","Selective Transfer","Fuzzy Modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GEFS.2013.6601048","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Genetic and Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems (GEFS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Genetic and Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems (GEFS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588676/6601046/06601048.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GEFS.2013.6601048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Participatory genetic learning in fuzzy system modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Participatory genetic learning in fuzzy system modeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601048/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601048/","accessionNumber":"13778667","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Participatory genetic learning in fuzzy system modeling","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP01SS0349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05904S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588676","isNumber":"6601046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588676","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6601046","articleId":"6601048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6601080,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Morero","affiliation":["Laboratorio de Comunicaciones Digitales, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina"],"firstName":"Damian","lastName":"Morero","id":"37546427200"},{"name":"Mario Hueda","affiliation":["Laboratorio de Comunicaciones Digitales, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Hueda","id":"37280511900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-8688"}],"articleNumber":"6601080","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Canada","url":"http://www.ieee.ca/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601080","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Decoding","Parity check codes","Bit error rate","Block codes","Signal to noise ratio","Concatenated codes","Error correction codes","Optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","concatenated codes","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes","product codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error floor mitigation","low-density parity-check codes","turbo product codes","TPC","LDPC codes","multiple serial code concatenation strategy","SCC strategy","iterative decoders","outer block codes","complex interleavers","decoding strategy","encoding strategy","high-speed optical communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["concatenated codes","error correction codes","high-speed optical communication","product codes","turbo codes"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel multiple serial code concatenation (SCC) strategy to combat the error-floor problem in iterated sparse graph-based error correcting codes such as turbo product-codes (TPC) and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Although SCC has been widely used in the past to reduce the error-floor in iterative decoders, the main stumbling block for its practical application in high-speed communication systems has been the need for long and complex outer codes. Alternative, short outer block codes with interleaving have been shown to provide a good tradeoff between complexity and performance. Nevertheless, their application to next-generation high-speed communication systems is still a major challenge as a result of the careful design of long complex interleavers needed to meet the requirements of these applications. The SCC scheme proposed in this work is based on the use of short outer block codes. Departing from techniques used in previous proposals, the long outer code and interleaver are replaced by a simple block code combined with a novel encoding/decoding strategy. This allows the proposed SCC to provide a better tradeoff between performance and complexity than previous techniques. Several application examples showing the benefits of the proposed SCC are described. Particularly, a new coding scheme suitable for high-speed optical communication is introduced.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2013.6601080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2013.6601080","startPage":"52","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/6601075/06601080.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel serial code concatenation strategies for error floor mitigation of low-density parity-check and turbo product codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Novel serial code concatenation strategies for error floor mitigation of low-density parity-check and turbo product codes","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13766694","publicationDate":"Spring 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel serial code concatenation strategies for error floor mitigation of low-density parity-check and turbo product codes","sourcePdf":"CJECE36N2MoreroHueda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018237S","chronDate":"Spring  2013","isNumber":"6601075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6601080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601082,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37407106400"},{"name":"Steven Blostein","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Blostein","id":"37268899400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-8688"}],"articleNumber":"6601082","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Canada","url":"http://www.ieee.ca/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601082","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Interference","Base stations","Vectors","Noise measurement","Optimization","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","media streaming","quality of service","relay networks (telecommunication)","source coding","space division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink beamforming","imperfect CSI","coordinated transmission","wireless systems","multimedia streaming","single base station","multiple antennas","data streams","single antenna destinations","single antenna fixed relays","direct link transmission","space division multiple access","quality-of-service constraints","beamforming precoding","distributed beamforming","relay beamforming","source precoder design","base station antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","cooperative systems","beamforming","channel estimation","semi-definite relaxation","multi-cell communications"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2013.6601082","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/6601075/06601082.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2013.6601082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink beamforming through relays: imperfect CSI and coordinated transmission","abstract":"Future wireless systems face challenges in supporting high-rate multimedia streaming with wide coverage area and at low power. Cooperative relaying is investigated in the following context: a single base station with multiple antennas simultaneously transmits different data streams to single-antenna destinations through a set of single-antenna fixed relays, with no direct link transmission between base stations and destinations. Transmission is via space-division multiple access with per-user quality-of-service constraints. The base station performs transmit beamforming (precoding) and relays cooperatively perform distributed beamforming. To address minimum-power source precoding and relay beamforming, the source precoder design with a fixed relay beamformer is first considered. Precoding is also generalized to multiple cooperating base stations. Next, the relay beamformer is optimized for a given source precoder and the process is iterated. The formulation is generalized to account for CSI estimates obtained from pilot symbol training. Simulation results quantify tradeoffs, including numbers of base station antennas and relays, effect of CSI quality on performance, as well as the impact of cooperating base stations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","volume":"36","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13766696","publicationDate":"Spring 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Downlink beamforming through relays: imperfect CSI and coordinated transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink beamforming through relays: imperfect CSI and coordinated transmission","sourcePdf":"CJECE36N2ZhengBlostein.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063219S","chronDate":"Spring  2013","isNumber":"6601075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6601082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6601119,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To study harmonic emission, three different states has been deeply studied, likely, high consumption and lamps-only states, where different household device combination together with lamps were connected.

In particular, peak-to-peak current ripple amplitude is analytically determined as a function of the modulation index. Minimum, maximum, and average values are also emphasized. Although the reference is made to continuous symmetric PWM, being the most simple and effective solution to minimize the current ripple, the analysis could be easily extended to either discontinuous or unsymmetrical modulation, both carrier-based and space vector PWM. The analytical developments for all the different subcases are verified by numerical simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Inverters","Vectors","Switches","Harmonic analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimisation","numerical analysis","power conversion","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current ripple amplitude evaluation","three-phase PWM voltage source inverters","three-phase PWM VSI","conversion topology","energy conversion systems","peak-to-peak current ripple distribution","peak-to-peak current ripple amplitude determination","modulation index","continuous symmetric PWM","current ripple minimization","unsymmetrical modulation","discontinuous modulation","carrier-based PWM","space vector PWM","numerical simulations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CPE.2013.6601146","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference-Workshop Compatibility And Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference-Workshop Compatibility And Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588687/6601114/06601146.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPE.2013.6601146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of current ripple amplitude in three-phase PWM voltage source inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of current ripple amplitude in three-phase PWM voltage source inverters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601146/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601146/","accessionNumber":"13778721","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of current ripple amplitude in three-phase PWM voltage source inverters","confLoc":"Ljubljana, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"CT2LF001384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055787S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588687","isNumber":"6601114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588687","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6601114","articleId":"6601146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6601151,"authors":[{"name":"Strzelecki Ryszard","affiliation":["Electrotechnical Institute, Poland"],"firstName":"Strzelecki","lastName":"Ryszard","id":"37562882300"},{"name":"Szczepankowski Pawe\u0142","affiliation":["Gdansk University of Technology"],"firstName":"Szczepankowski","lastName":"Pawe\u0142","id":"37085932412"},{"name":"Strzelecka Natalia","affiliation":["Gdansk University of Technology, Poland","Gdynia Maritime University"],"firstName":"Strzelecka","lastName":"Natalia","id":"38558117300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4913-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4911-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9546"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9538"}],"articleNumber":"6601151","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Vectors","Capacitors","Choppers (circuits)","Voltage control","Inverters","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["choppers (circuits)","clamps","diodes","electric current control","finite element analysis","PWM power convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified dead-beat controller","finite element analysis","shape function","2P-SVPWM","two phase space vector pulse width modulation","PO-PWM modulation","three-level double chopper topology","DC link voltage balancing problem","4L-DC back-to-back converter","active DC link voltage control","four level diode-clamped back-to-back converter"]}],"abstract":"This article presents the design and control of 4L-DC back-to-back converter.

This allows for reduced maintenance, shortens development time, and permits automated model updates, system model executions, and impact assessment. Part of model driven engineering, multi-modeling integrates models that abstract various aspects of the system, such as I/O, behavioral, and functional among others, at different levels of granularity and using various domain specific modeling languages. An important challenge is to understand the relationship between these models towards preserving multi-model consistency as changes in one model affect other models in the multi-model. This paper presents a multi-modeling architecture that captures model relationships at syntactic and semantic levels. We define a taxonomy of change effects that relies on a relationship correspondence meta-model to highlight and trace the impact of changes across various modeling environments. Following the correspondence meta-model and associated change effects, our prototype implementation ensures that multi-model consistency is met and notifies stakeholders of significant changes. Our case study of a submarine tracking system checks multi model consistency and highlights the impact of changes across system modeling tools that capture its functional and behavioral aspects among others. Our experiments show the feasibility of our approach while highlighting important challenges.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASWEC.2013.24","publicationTitle":"2013 22nd Australian Software Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 22nd Australian Software Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6601074/6601273/06601300.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"136","doi":"10.1109/ASWEC.2013.24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Driven Approach for Ensuring Change Traceability and Multi-model Consistency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Approach for Ensuring Change Traceability and Multi-model Consistency","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601300/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13780515","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601300/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Approach for Ensuring Change Traceability and Multi-model Consistency","confLoc":"Hawthorne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4995a127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078495S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6601074","isNumber":"6601273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6601074","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6601273","articleId":"6601300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601304,"authors":[{"name":"Passakorn Phannachitta","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Passakorn","lastName":"Phannachitta","id":"38233044600"},{"name":"Jacky Keung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jacky","lastName":"Keung","id":"37545406300"},{"name":"Ken-Ichi Matsumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken-Ichi","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37289533100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4995-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0803"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5408"}],"articleNumber":"6601304","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"abstract":"The success of estimating software project costs using analog-based reasoning has been noticeable for over a decade. The estimation accuracy is heavily depends on different heuristic methods to selecting the best feature subsets and a suitable set of similar projects from the repository. A complete search of all possible combinations may not be feasible due to insufficient computational resources for such a large search space. In this work, the problem is revisited, and we propose a novel algorithm tailored for analogy-based software cost estimation utilizing the latest CUDA computing framework to enable estimation with large project datasets. We demonstrated the use of the proposed distributed algorithm executed on graphic processing units (GPU), which has a different architecture suitable for compute-intensive problems. The method has been evaluated using 11 real-world datasets from the PROMISE repository. Results shows that the proposed ABE-CUDA approach is able to produce the best project cost estimates by determining the best feature subsets and the most suitable number of analogous projects for estimation, significantly improves the overall feature search time and prediction accuracy for software cost estimation. More importantly, the optimized estimation result can be used as a baseline benchmark to compare with other sophisticated analogy-based methods for software cost estimation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Estimation","Accuracy","Sorting","Prediction algorithms","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","parallel architectures","software cost estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogy-based software cost estimation","CUDA framework","software project cost estimation","analog-based reasoning","heuristic method","CUDA computing framework","distributed algorithm","graphic processing unit","GPU","compute-intensive problem","PROMISE repository","ABE-CUDA approach","baseline benchmark"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Cost Estimation","Analogy","CUDA","Empirical Experiments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601304","doi":"10.1109/ASWEC.2013.28","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 22nd Australian Software Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6601074/6601273/06601304.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASWEC.2013.28","startPage":"165","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601273","publicationTitle":"2013 22nd Australian Software Engineering Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Empirical Experiment on Analogy-Based Software Cost Estimation with CUDA Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Empirical Experiment on Analogy-Based Software Cost Estimation with CUDA Framework","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601304/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2013","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601304/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13780523","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Empirical Experiment on Analogy-Based Software Cost Estimation with CUDA Framework","confLoc":"Hawthorne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4995a165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089083S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6601074","isNumber":"6601273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6601074","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6601273","articleId":"6601304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6601319,"authors":[{"name":"Teodor Ivan","affiliation":["Departement d'informatique et recherche op\u00e9rationnelle, Universite de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Teodor","lastName":"Ivan","id":"37074246900"},{"name":"El Mostapha Aboulhamid","affiliation":["Departement d'informatique et recherche op\u00e9rationnelle, Universite de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"El Mostapha","lastName":"Aboulhamid","id":"38185221900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9940-9436-1-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-5475"}],"articleNumber":"6601319","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring limits of parallelism in FPGA-based Boolean satisfiability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601319","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Read only memory","Electronics packaging","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","circuit simulation","computability","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based Boolean satisfiability","two-part SAT solver","complete algorithm","memory bottleneck impact characterization","VHDL model","software simulator","state-of-the-art hardware SAT solvers","MiniSAT software solver","circuit frequency projections","problem execution time approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAT","FPGA","parallel solver","hardware solver"]}],"abstract":"A two-part SAT solver using a complete algorithm was developed and used to characterize the impact of eliminating memory bottleneck from SAT solving.

In particular, we explore how different last-level cache configurations affect the idle periods of DRAM, and whether those idle periods can be exploited through the use of self refresh power down mode to enable maximum energy reduction in both the energy consumption of the last-level cache and DRAM. A suitable last-level cache configuration reduces active power consumption of DRAM by reducing read/write accesses to it and use of the self refresh power down mode reduces background power of DRAM, creating a possibility of significant energy reduction. We propose a power mode controller to adaptively transition DRAM to self refresh power down mode when a memory request hits the last-level cache, and activate the DRAM when a memory request misses the last-level cache. We experimented with eight applications from mediabench, and found that an optimal last-level cache configuration with self refresh power down mode can save up to 89% energy compared to a standard memory controller. Additionally, the use of self refresh power down mode degraded the performance by a maximum of 2% only. Thus, we conclude that exploration and optimization of last-level cache can result in significant energy savings for memory subsystem with little performance degradation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A case study on exploration of last-level cache for energy reduction in DDR3 DRAM","doi":"10.1109/MECO.2013.6601372","startPage":"42","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MECO.2013.6601372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601312","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6590065/6601312/06601372.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"A case study on exploration of last-level cache for energy reduction in DDR3 DRAM","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601372/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13780093","conferenceDate":"15-20 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A case study on exploration of last-level cache for energy reduction in DDR3 DRAM","confLoc":"Budva, Montenegro","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055229S","chronDate":"15-20 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6590065","isNumber":"6601312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6590065","xplore-issue":"6601312","articleId":"6601372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601420,"authors":[{"name":"Fraida Fund","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Fraida","lastName":"Fund","id":"37074037700"},{"name":"Cong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38025458500"},{"name":"Thanasis Korakis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Thanasis","lastName":"Korakis","id":"37300164400"},{"name":"Michael Zink","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zink","id":"37266968900"},{"name":"Shivendra Panwar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Shivendra","lastName":"Panwar","id":"37270109100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5003-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6601420","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Throughput","Mobile communication","Internet","Streaming media","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GENI WiMAX performance","campus testbed","mobile application","wireless testbed","high data rate","wireless signal quality","network traffic pattern","wireless Internet application","multiple TCP flow"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601420","doi":"10.1109/GREE.2013.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GREE.2013.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601396","publicationTitle":"2013 Second GENI Research and Educational Experiment Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Second GENI Research and Educational Experiment Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel7/6601108/6601396/06601420.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GENI WiMAX Performance: Evaluation and Comparison of Two Campus Testbeds","abstract":"In the last few years, there has been an increasing awareness of the need to evaluate new mobile applications and protocols in realistic wireless settings, and platforms such as the GENI WiMAX testbeds have been developed to fulfill this need. However, wireless testbed users have experienced frustration when straightforward usage scenarios do not consistently agree with the high data rates that are advertised by the wireless technology. This work seeks to clarify the performance characteristics of two GENI WiMAX testbeds under various wireless signal conditions and network traffic patterns. By measuring the performance of several popular wireless Internet applications in two very different wireless environments, we gain a deeper understanding of how a researcher may expect the GENI WiMAX platform to behave. Our findings include some counterintuitive results, e.g. that increasing signal quality can reduce application throughput, and that applications using a single TCP flow may achieve as much as 72% less throughput than an application in an identical setting that uses multiple TCP flows. With this work, we hope to help other researchers design realistic experiments on wireless Internet systems, understand the perceived shortcomings of the GENI WiMAX platform, and interpret their experimental results in the context of the wireless setting in which the experiment was conducted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 March 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601420/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13780541","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"GENI WiMAX Performance: Evaluation and Comparison of Two Campus Testbeds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GENI WiMAX Performance: Evaluation and Comparison of Two Campus Testbeds","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"5003a073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085415S","chronDate":"20-22 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6601108","isNumber":"6601396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6601108","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6601396","articleId":"6601420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6601454,"authors":[{"name":"Diego H.

Identifying protein native conformations makes it possible to predict its function within the organism. Knowing this also helps the development of new drugs and the comprehension of some biological mechanisms. During years some techniques have been developed for this purpose but, due to their high cost, it is necessary to use simplified models of protein structures. However, even the simplest models, with low biological plausibility, are excessively complex from the computational point of view. This paper reports the application of Differential Evolution (DE) to solve the PSP problem using a Toy Model (also known as the AB Model) in both 2D and 3D to represent the protein structure. This work presents two different versions of the DE algorithm (basic and adaptive) using a parallel architecture (master-slave) based on Message Passing Interface in a cluster. Some special operators for DE were developed: explosion and mirror mutation. All tests executed in this work used four benchmark sequences, ranging from 13 to 55 amino acids. The results for both parallel DE algorithms using both 2D and 3D models were compared with other works in the literature. The DE algorithm achieved excellent results. Overall results encourage further research towards the use of knowledge-based operators to improve further the performance of DE.","doi":"10.1109/SDE.2013.6601454","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Differential Evolution (SDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Differential Evolution (SDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588689/6601433/06601454.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDE.2013.6601454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved parallel differential evolution approach for protein structure prediction using both 2D and 3D off-lattice models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601454","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601454/","displayDocTitle":"An improved parallel differential evolution approach for protein structure prediction using both 2D and 3D off-lattice models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13769992","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601454/","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved parallel differential evolution approach for protein structure prediction using both 2D and 3D off-lattice models","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP20SS0747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069674S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588689","isNumber":"6601433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588689","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6601433","articleId":"6601454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601471,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Micconi","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Micconi","id":"37545900400"},{"name":"Deepak Gangadharan","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Gangadharan","id":"37860517500"},{"name":"Paul Pop","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Pop","id":"37278880300"},{"name":"Jan Madsen","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Madsen","id":"37265832800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0658-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3109"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3117"}],"articleNumber":"6601471","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601471","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microarchitecture","Uncertainty","Decoding","Digital audio players","Program processors","Radio frequency","VLIW"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","evolutionary computation","multiprocessing systems","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiASIP platform synthesis","application specific instruction set processors","heterogeneous processing element","timing constraint","design space exploration","DSE","worst-case execution time","WCET","evolutionary algorithm","stochastic schedulability analysis","optimization problem","distributed platform"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIES.2013.6601471","endPage":"67","startPage":"59","publicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems (SIES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems (SIES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589042/6601457/06601471.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIES.2013.6601471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-ASIP platform synthesis for real-time applications","abstract":"In this paper we are interested in deriving a distributed platform, composed of heterogeneous processing elements, targeted to applications that have strict timing constraints. We consider that the platform may use multiple Application Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPs). An ASIP is synthesized and tuned for a specific set of tasks (i.e., a task cluster). During design space exploration (DSE), we evaluate each platform solution visited in terms of its cost and performance, i.e., its ability to execute the applications such that they meet their timing constraints. To determine if the applications are schedulable, we have to know the worst-case execution time (WCET) of each task. However, we can determine the WCETs only after the ASIPs are synthesized, which is time consuming and therefore cannot be done during DSE. To address this circular dependency (the ASIPs depend on the task clustering, and the WCETs of tasks, used to determine schedulability, depend on how ASIPs are synthesized), we propose an uncertainty model for the WCETs, which captures the range of possible ASIP implementations. Based on this model, we synthesize a multi-ASIP platform, such that the applications have a high chance of being schedulable and the cost constraints imposed on the platform are fulfilled. We propose an Evolutionary Algorithm-based approach, which uses a novel stochastic schedulability analysis to solve this optimization problem. The proposed approach has been evaluated using several benchmarks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601471/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601471/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13779352","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-ASIP platform synthesis for real-time applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-ASIP platform synthesis for real-time applications","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"P24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094505S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589042","isNumber":"6601457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589042","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6601457","articleId":"6601471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601499,"authors":[{"name":"Hajer Herbegue","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Hajer","lastName":"Herbegue","id":"37074215000"},{"name":"Hugues Cass\u00e9","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Hugues","lastName":"Cass\u00e9","id":"37540989300"},{"name":"Mamoun Filali","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Mamoun","lastName":"Filali","id":"37595580500"},{"name":"Christine Rochange","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Rochange","id":"37373772700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0658-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3109"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3117"}],"articleNumber":"6601499","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Registers","Hardware","Pipelines","Syntactics","Iron","Buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","electronic engineering computing","instruction sets","microcomputers","real-time systems","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware architecture specification","constraint-based WCET computation","worst-case execution times","critical real-time system design","binary code","static analysis","OTAWA tool","Sim-nML language","XML files","microarchitecture","instruction set description","time calculation","constraint solving problem","microprocessors"]}],"abstract":"The analysis of the worst-case execution times is necessary in the design of critical real-time systems. To get sound and precise times, the WCET analysis for these systems must be performed on binary code and based on static analysis. OTAWA, a tool providing WCET computation, uses the Sim-nML language to describe the instruction set and XML files to describe the micro-architecture. The latter information is usually inadequate to describe real architectures and, therefore, requires specific modifications, currently performed by hand, to allow correct time calculation. In this paper, we propose to extend Sim-nML in order to support the description of modern microarchitecture features along the instruction set description and to seamlessly derive the time calculation. This time computation is specified as a constraint solving problem that is automatically synthesized from the extended Sim-nML. Thanks to its declarative aspect, this approach makes easier and modular the description of complex features of microprocessors while maintaining a sound process to compute times.","doi":"10.1109/SIES.2013.6601499","publicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems (SIES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems (SIES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589042/6601457/06601499.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIES.2013.6601499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601457","startPage":"259","endPage":"268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware architecture specification and constraint-based WCET computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware architecture specification and constraint-based WCET computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601499/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13779348","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601499/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware architecture specification and constraint-based WCET computation","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"P73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056844S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589042","isNumber":"6601457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589042","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6601457","articleId":"6601499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601512,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A specific laboratory setup has been realised to evaluate the sensitivity of the early-time amplitudes to the variations of the subsurface salt concentration (i.e., conductivity). To assess the capacity of the early-time amplitude to follow the electrical conductivity changes, we compare the early-time results acquired using the envelope of the first part of GPR signals with the concurrent conductivity measured with TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry). The GPR survey has been carried out using a bistatic radar unit (Sensors & Software, Inc) operating at 1 GHz. Further useful information has been derived by suitably implementing a full-wave numerical modelling, able to accurately analyse the features of the waves detected by the GPR with flexible parameterization. Our results indicate that the near-surface electromagnetic properties of the material can be directly extracted from the GPR early-time amplitude technique. In particular, both experimental and numerical data show a very high correlation coefficient between the radar signal amplitude and the TDR-derived electrical conductivities.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Conductivity","Permittivity","Conductivity measurement","Materials","Educational institutions","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical conductivity measurement","electromagnetic devices","ground penetrating radar","numerical analysis","porous materials","radar detection","time-domain reflectometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["early-time GPR amplitude technique","electrical conductivity monitoring","ground penetrating radar","electric conductivity detection","porous material","permittivity","early-time amplitude sensitivity evaluation","subsurface salt concentration","concurrent conductivity measurement","TDR","time domain reflectometry","bistatic radar unit","Sensors & Software, Inc","full-wave numerical modelling","flexible parameterization","material near-surface electromagnetic property","radar signal amplitude","frequency 1 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPR","Early-time amplitude","TDR","Experimental setup","Numerical modelling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWAGPR.2013.6601512","publicationTitle":"2013 7th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589049/6601504/06601512.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAGPR.2013.6601512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of the early-time GPR amplitude technique for electrical conductivity monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of the early-time GPR amplitude technique for electrical conductivity monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601512/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601512/","accessionNumber":"13779418","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of the early-time GPR amplitude technique for electrical conductivity monitoring","confLoc":"Nantes, France","sourcePdf":"iwagpr2013paper18Ferrara.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048394S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589049","isNumber":"6601504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589049","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6601504","articleId":"6601512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6601519,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Such layers can act as low-velocity waveguides in the GPR signal and can be related to a zone of preferential flow or impermeable clay lenses. Here, we characterize a saturated gravel aquifer in 3D by applying 2D full-waveform inversion and an amplitude analysis approach that explores the information content present in the measured GPR data. The full-waveform inversion results of the permittivity and conductivity show decimeter-scale high resolution images and similar results at the borehole crossing and at the intersection of the diagonal planes. In all six planes, a high permittivity layer between 5m-6m depth was resolved, which acted due to the high contrast to the surrounding as a low-velocity waveguide indicating a zone of higher porosity. The amplitude analysis of the measured data showed significant wave propagation for transmitter located in and outside this zone. By using this information, the method was able to detect the waveguide layers and their boundaries in the measured data, which were confirmed by the full-waveform inversion results. Permeability logs indicate a zone of preferential flow between 5m-6m depth, which shows a good agreement with the high permittivity/porosity zone detected by the full-waveform inversion.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAGPR.2013.6601519","publicationTitle":"2013 7th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589049/6601504/06601519.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/IWAGPR.2013.6601519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D characterization of an aquifer using full-waveform inversion and amplitude analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"3D characterization of an aquifer using full-waveform inversion and amplitude analysis","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601519/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779404","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601519/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D characterization of an aquifer using full-waveform inversion and amplitude analysis","confLoc":"Nantes, France","sourcePdf":"iwagpr2013paper24Klotzsche.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117211S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589049","isNumber":"6601504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589049","xplore-issue":"6601504","articleId":"6601519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601527,"authors":[{"name":"Soufiane Nounouh","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel CNRS, Ecole Centrale Marseille, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Soufiane","lastName":"Nounouh","id":"37712959000"},{"name":"Christelle Eyraud","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel CNRS, Ecole Centrale Marseille, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Christelle","lastName":"Eyraud","id":"37595683900"},{"name":"Herv\u00e9 Tortel","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel CNRS, Ecole Centrale Marseille, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Herv\u00e9","lastName":"Tortel","id":"37541508900"},{"name":"Am\u00e9lie Litman","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel CNRS, Ecole Centrale Marseille, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Am\u00e9lie","lastName":"Litman","id":"37530338500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0940-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0937-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6601527","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Imaging","Soil","Permittivity","Scattering","Finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","geophysical techniques","permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near subsurface imaging","single frequency scanner","multistatic configuration","near subsurface permittivity spatial distribution","electromagnetic fields","calibration","antenna radiation pattern","scattering problem","spectral bandwidth"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601527","abstract":"We propose an approach for probing the near-subsurface based on the use of a single frequency combined with a multistatic configuration.

In our research, we propose a similarity search of malware to detect these variants using novel distance metrics. We describe a malware signature by the set of control flowgraphs the malware contains. We use a distance metric based on the distance between feature vectors of string-based signatures. The feature vector is a decomposition of the set of graphs into either fixed size k-subgraphs, or q-gram strings of the high-level source after decompilation. We use this distance metric to perform pre-filtering. We also propose a more effective but less computationally efficient distance metric based on the minimum matching distance. The minimum matching distance uses the string edit distances between programs' decompiled flowgraphs, and the linear sum assignment problem to construct a minimum sum weight matching between two sets of graphs. We implement the distance metrics in a complete malware variant detection system. The evaluation shows that our approach is highly effective in terms of a limited false positive rate and our system detects more malware variants when compared to the detection rates of other algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601601/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2014","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14432155","htmlLink":"/document/6601601/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Control Flow-Based Malware VariantDetection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Flow-Based Malware VariantDetection","sourcePdf":"tdsc-Xiang-40-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103968S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"6851971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6851971","articleId":"6601601","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6601618,"authors":[{"name":"Yujie Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Dong","id":"37674637900"},{"name":"Jenna Scisco","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Jenna","lastName":"Scisco","id":"37086624003"},{"name":"Mike Wilson","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Wilson","id":"37086623755"},{"name":"Eric Muth","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Muth","id":"37678651600"},{"name":"Adam Hoover","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Hoover","id":"37276175400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2194"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2208"}],"articleNumber":"6601618","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wrist","Accuracy","Sensors","Motion segmentation","Accelerometers","Gyroscopes","Data collection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical measurement","medical disorders","medical signal processing","nonelectric sensing devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy intake monitoring","body-worn sensor tool","eating activity","vigorous wrist motion","watch-like configuration","wrist motion tracking","free-living","period of eating detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerometer","activity recognition","body motion tracking","energy intake","gyroscope","obesity"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Accelerometry","Adolescent","Adult","Algorithms","Cell Phones","Eating","Energy Intake","Female","Humans","Male","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Wrist","Young Adult"]}],"abstract":"This paper is motivated by the growing prevalence of obesity, a health problem affecting over 500 million people. Measurements of energy intake are commonly used for the study and treatment of obesity. However, the most widely used tools rely upon self-report and require a considerable manual effort, leading to under reporting of consumption, noncompliance, and discontinued use over the long term. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new method that uses a watch-like configuration of sensors to continuously track wrist motion throughout the day and automatically detect periods of eating. Our method uses the novel idea that meals tend to be preceded and succeeded by the periods of vigorous wrist motion. We describe an algorithm that segments and classifies such periods as eating or noneating activities. We also evaluate our method on a large dataset (43 subjects, 449 total h of data, containing 116 periods of eating) collected during free-living. Our results show an accuracy of 81% for detecting eating at 1-s resolution in comparison to manually marked event logs of periods eating. These results indicate that vigorous wrist motion is a useful indicator for identifying the boundaries of eating activities, and that our method should prove useful in the continued development of body-worn sensor tools for monitoring energy intake.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Periods of Eating During Free-Living by Tracking Wrist Motion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2013.2282471","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/6846381/06601618.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2013.2282471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6846381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601618/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Periods of Eating During Free-Living by Tracking Wrist Motion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6601618/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14446354","pubMedId":"24058042","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Periods of Eating During Free-Living by Tracking Wrist Motion","sourcePdf":"jbhi-hoover-2282471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107914S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6846381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"6846381","articleId":"6601618","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6601620,"authors":[{"name":"Kin-Lu Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6675045/6601620/6601620-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kin-Lu Wong (M'91\u2013SM'97\u2013F'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA, in 1981, 1984, and 1986, respectively.","From 1986 to 1987, he was a Visiting Scientist with the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, Munich, Germany.

While in the antenna's higher band, the chip inductor provides a high inductance and limits the excitation of the branch strip, thereby making the branch strip have negligible effects on the high-band operation.

Moreover, by applying model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) to dual-energy data, one might also expect to reduce noise and improve resolution. However, the direct implementation of dual-energy MBIR requires the use of a nonlinear forward model, which increases both complexity and computation. Alternatively, simplified forward models have been used which treat the material-decomposed channels separately, but these approaches do not fully account for the statistical dependencies in the channels. In this paper, we present a method for joint dual-energy MBIR (JDE-MBIR), which simplifies the forward model while still accounting for the complete statistical dependency in the material-decomposed sinogram components. The JDE-MBIR approach works by using a quadratic approximation to the polychromatic log-likelihood and a simple but exact nonnegativity constraint in the image domain. We demonstrate that our method is particularly effective when the DECT system uses fast kVp switching, since in this case the model accounts for the inaccuracy of interpolated sinogram entries. Both phantom and clinical results show that the proposed model produces images that compare favorably in quality to previous decomposition-based methods, including FBP and other statistical iterative approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2013.2282370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6697885/06601625.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6697885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2013.2282370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction for Dual-Energy X-Ray CT Using a Joint Quadratic Likelihood Model","volume":"33","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601625/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998092","pubMedId":"24058024","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601625/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction for Dual-Energy X-Ray CT Using a Joint Quadratic Likelihood Model","sourcePdf":"tmi-zhang-2282370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116492S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6697885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6697885","articleId":"6601625","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6601638,"authors":[{"name":"Zhikai Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zhikai","lastName":"Tang","id":"38548560100"},{"name":"Qimeng Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Qimeng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38236355600"},{"name":"Yunyou Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yunyou","lastName":"Lu","id":"38553594000"},{"name":"Sen Huang","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, HK"],"firstName":"Sen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37577513100"},{"name":"Shu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Yang","id":"38184147300"},{"name":"Xi Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37078390700"},{"name":"Kevin J.

The typical UWA channel distortion can be described by a multi-scale, multi-lag (MSML) channel model. Many UWA communication systems employ resampling by a single-scale at the front-end to compensate for the scale effects of UWA channels. In this letter, the optimal resampling parameter for OFDM signaling over MSML channels is investigated from a Bayesian perspective. The resampling parameter is selected to minimize the inter-carrier interference (ICI) resulting from the MSML channel for OFDM signaling. The exact interference energy is computed, but is intractable for optimization, thus, an upper bound is employed for optimization. Numerical results verify the tightness of the bound and quantify the performance of the Bayesian approach. As expected, the proposed method outperforms previous deterministic methods for resampling in MSML channels, which in turn outperform the classical packet-length-based approach, and is more effective in ICI mitigation.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2013.2282339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6584011/06601639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2013.2282339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6584011","startPage":"1118","endPage":"1121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Bayesian Resampling for OFDM Signaling Over Multi-scale Multi-lag Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Bayesian Resampling for OFDM Signaling Over Multi-scale Multi-lag Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795473","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601639/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Bayesian Resampling for OFDM Signaling Over Multi-scale Multi-lag Channels","sourcePdf":"lsp-beygiharchegani-2282339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057411S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6584011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6584011","articleId":"6601639","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601641,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas LaBella","affiliation":["Virginia Tech, Future Energy Electronics Center, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6742621/6601641/6601641-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas LaBella (S\u201907) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, VA, USA, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in power electronics.","Since 2009, he has been a Graduate Research Assistant with the Future Energy Electronics Center, Virginia Tech.

In order to mitigate ground leakage currents and to be able to use a high-efficiency, nonisolated grid-tied inverter, it is also desirable for this microconverter to provide galvanic isolation between the PV module and the inverter. This paper presents a novel, isolated topology that is able to meet the high efficiency over a wide input voltage range requirement. This topology yields high efficiency through low circulating currents, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and low-current switching of the primary side devices, ZCS of the output diodes, and direct power transfer to the load for the majority of switching cycle. This topology is also able to provide voltage regulation through basic fixed-frequency pulsewidth modulated (PWM) control. These features are able to be achieved with the simple addition of a secondary-side bidirectional ac switch to the isolated series resonant converter. Detailed analysis of the operation of this converter is discussed along with a detailed design procedure. Experimental results of a 300-W prototype are given. The prototype reached a peak power stage efficiency of 98.3% and a California Energy Commission (CEC) weighted power stage efficiency of 98.0% at the nominal input voltage.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2282258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6742621/06601641.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2282258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742621","startPage":"3473","endPage":"3484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bidirectional-Switch-Based Wide-Input Range High-Efficiency Isolated Resonant Converter for Photovoltaic Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Bidirectional-Switch-Based Wide-Input Range High-Efficiency Isolated Resonant Converter for Photovoltaic Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14112097","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6601641/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bidirectional-Switch-Based Wide-Input Range High-Efficiency Isolated Resonant Converter for Photovoltaic Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-labella-2282258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086117S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6742621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6742621","articleId":"6601641","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6601647,"authors":[{"name":"Chunlong He","affiliation":["National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6766688/6601647/6601647-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunlong He (S'10) received the M.S. degree in communication and information science from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2007.

Our aim is to maximize energy efficiency (EE) under the constraints of the overall transmit power of each remote access unit (RAU), proportional fairness data rates, and bit error rates (BERs). Because of the nonconvex nature of the optimization problem, obtaining the optimal solution is extremely computationally complex. Therefore, we develop a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm, which separates subcarrier allocation and power allocation. For the low-complexity algorithm, we first allocate subcarriers by assuming equal power distribution. Then, by exploiting the properties of fractional programming, we transform the nonconvex optimization problem in fractional form into an equivalent optimization problem in subtractive form, which includes a tractable solution. Next, an optimal energy-efficient power-allocation algorithm is developed to maximize EE while maintaining proportional fairness. Through computer simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm and illustrate the fundamental tradeoff between energy- and spectral-efficient transmission

conversion based on the techniques of photonic time stretch (PTS) and compressive sensing (CS) is proposed. In the system, a multitone signal within a wide bandwidth (spectrally sparse) signal is slowed down in the time domain by a photonic time stretcher. The stretched signal is then down-sampled and reconstructed by a random-demodulator-based CS scheme, in which random mixing is realized in an optical domain. Thanks to the techniques of PTS and CS, wideband spectrally sparse signals can be acquired with a sampling rate far below the Nyquist rate of the original signal. The optical random mixing applied in the system has the advantages of lower distortions and larger bandwidth compared to its electrical counterpart. In order to construct a Gaussian measurement matrix with zero mean, balanced detection is applied after the optical mixer. In addition, in order to eliminate the dc component and the even-order harmonics of the stretched signal, we propose to use balanced PTS technique in the system. We demonstrate that a system with a time stretch factor 20 and a compression factor 4 can effectively acquire a spectrally sparse wideband signal, which means a sampling rate as low as 1/80 of the Nyquist rate.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2282088","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6616591/06601648.pdf","startPage":"3395","endPage":"3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2282088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6616591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-Nyquist Sampled Analog-to-Digital Conversion Based on Photonic Time Stretch and Compressive Sensing With Optical Random Mixing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601648/","displayDocTitle":"Sub-Nyquist Sampled Analog-to-Digital Conversion Based on Photonic Time Stretch and Compressive Sensing With Optical Random Mixing","volume":"31","issue":"21","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13810245","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601648/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Nyquist Sampled Analog-to-Digital Conversion Based on Photonic Time Stretch and Compressive Sensing With Optical Random Mixing","sourcePdf":"jlt-chi-2282088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089248S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6616591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6616591","articleId":"6601648","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601651,"authors":[{"name":"Yongchang Zhang","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Motor Drives Engineering Research Center of Beijing, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6742621/6601651/6601651-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongchang Zhang (M\u201910) received the B.S. degree from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009, both in electrical engineering.","From August 2009 to August 2011, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Technology Sydney, where he was engaged in PMSM drives for PHEV and control of doubly fed induction generator for wind energy applications.

The novel approach is able to operate at low switching frequency and provides excellent steady-state and dynamic performances, which are useful for high-power wind energy applications. Three vectors are selected and applied during one control period to reduce both active and reactive power ripples. Compared to prior three-vectors-based art using two switching tables, the novel approach only needs one unified switching table to obtain the three vectors. Furthermore, the duration of each vector is obtained in a much simpler and straightforward way. The switching frequency can be significantly reduced by appropriately arranging the switching sequence of the three vectors. The influence of one step delay caused by digital implementation is also investigated. The possibility of operating the proposed PDPC under unbalanced grid voltage is also briefly discussed. The novel PDPC is compared with prior three-vectors-based art and its effectiveness is confirmed by the simulation results from a 2-MW-DFIG system and the experimental results from a scaled-down laboratory setup.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2282405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6742621/06601651.pdf","startPage":"3485","endPage":"3500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2282405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Vectors-Based Predictive Direct Power Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Generator for Wind Energy Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601651/","displayDocTitle":"Three-Vectors-Based Predictive Direct Power Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Generator for Wind Energy Applications","volume":"29","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14112126","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601651/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Vectors-Based Predictive Direct Power Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Generator for Wind Energy Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2282405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088809S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6742621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6742621","articleId":"6601651","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6601656,"authors":[{"name":"Junya Honda","affiliation":["Department of Complexity Science and Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa-shi, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Junya","lastName":"Honda","id":"37888573000"},{"name":"Hirosuke Yamamoto","affiliation":["Department of Complexity Science and Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa-shi, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirosuke","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37277594400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6601656","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1325},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601656","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Decoding","Channel coding","Error probability","Source coding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar coding","alphabet extension","asymmetric models","channel coding","lossy source coding","optimal symbol distributions","nonuniform distributions","Gallager scheme","optimal distribution","rational numbers","channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetric channels","channel coding","lossy source coding","polar codes"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers polar coding for asymmetric settings, that is, channel coding for asymmetric channels and lossy source coding for nonuniform sources and/or asymmetric distortion measures. The difficulty for asymmetric settings comes from the fact that the optimal symbol distributions of codewords are not always uniform. It is known that such nonuniform distributions can be realized by Gallager's scheme which maps multiple auxiliary symbols distributed uniformly to an actual symbol. However, the complexity of Gallager's scheme increases considerably for the case that the optimal distribution cannot be approximated by simple rational numbers. To overcome this problem for the asymmetric settings, a new polar coding scheme is proposed, which can attain the channel capacity without any alphabet extension by invoking results on polar coding for lossless compression. It is also shown that the proposed scheme achieves a better tradeoff between complexity and decoding error probability in many cases.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2282305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2282305","startPage":"7829","endPage":"7838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6670132/06601656.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar Coding Without Alphabet Extension for Asymmetric Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Polar Coding Without Alphabet Extension for Asymmetric Models","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13914254","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar Coding Without Alphabet Extension for Asymmetric Models","sourcePdf":"tit-honda-2282305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058099S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6670132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"102","articleId":"6601656","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601671,"authors":[{"name":"Hayssam El-Razouk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western University, London, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Hayssam El-Razouk received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2002, with the first rank, and the M.Esc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, in 2006.","He was a Software Engineer with RedIron Technologies, London, ON, Canada, from 2006 to 2011.

The performance is fundamentally limited by the cross-link interference. We propose a cache-induced opportunistic cooperative MIMO (CoMP) for interference mitigation. By caching a portion of the media files, the BSs opportunistically employ CoMP to transform the cross-link interference into spatial multiplexing gain. We study a mixed-timescale optimization of MIMO precoding and cache control to minimize the transmit power under the rate constraint. The cache control is to create more CoMP opportunities and is adaptive to the long-term popularity of the media files. The precoding is to guarantee the rate requirement and is adaptive to the channel state information and cache state at the BSs. The joint stochastic optimization problem is decomposed into a short-term precoding and a long-term cache control problem. We propose a precoding algorithm which converges to a stationary point of the short-term problem.

Previous research in the literature indicated that the IPFM model is widely accepted as a functional description of the cardiac pacemaker, and thus, very useful in modeling the mechanism by which the autonomic nervous system modulates the heart rate (HR). On the other hand, recently CS becomes an emerging technology that has attracted great attention since it is capable of acquiring and reconstructing signals that are considered sparse or compressible, even when the number of measurements is small. Using the IPFM model, we here present a CS-based algorithm for deriving the amplitude spectrum of the modulating signal for HRV assessments. In fact, the application of the CS method into HRV spectral estimation is unprecedented. Numerical results produced by a real RR database of PhysioNet demonstrated that the proposed approach can robustly provide high-fidelity HRV spectral estimates, even under the situation of a degree of incompleteness in the RR data caused by ectopic or missing beats.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing Technology-Based Spectral Estimation of Heart Rate Variability Using the Integral Pulse Frequency Modulation Model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2013.2282307","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/6809230/06601707.pdf","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2013.2282307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing Technology-Based Spectral Estimation of Heart Rate Variability Using the Integral Pulse Frequency Modulation Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6601707/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267376","pubMedId":"24058040","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"102-2221-E-182-023"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing Technology-Based Spectral Estimation of Heart Rate Variability Using the Integral Pulse Frequency Modulation Model","sourcePdf":"jbhi-chen-2282307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092023S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6809230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6809230","articleId":"6601707","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6601713,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6601658/6601713/6601713-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh (S'13) received the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. degrees both in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran.","He is currently completing the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Isfahan University of Technology.

To this end, we briefly present a discrete-time formulation of the problem as well as the optimal detector in the presence of Gaussian clutter. Due to the lack of analytical expression for receiver operation characteristic (ROC), code design based on ROC is not feasible. Therefore, we consider several popular information-theoretic criteria including Bhattacharyya distance, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, J-divergence, and mutual information (MI) as design metrics. The code optimization problems associated with different information-theoretic criteria are obtained and cast under a unified framework. We propose two general methods based on Majorization-Minimization to tackle the optimization problems in the framework. The first method provides optimal solutions via successive majorizations whereas the second one consists of a majorization step, a relaxation, and a synthesis stage. Moreover, derivations of the proposed methods are extended to tackle the code design problems with a peak-to-average ratio power (PAR) constraint. Using numerical investigations, a general analysis of the coded system performance, computational efficiency of the proposed methods, and the behavior of the information-theoretic criteria is provided.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2278154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6601658/06601713.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2278154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601658","startPage":"5401","endPage":"5416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Optimization Framework for Multi-Static Radar Code Design Using Information-Theoretic Criteria","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unified Optimization Framework for Multi-Static Radar Code Design Using Information-Theoretic Criteria","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"21","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13796365","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601713/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Optimization Framework for Multi-Static Radar Code Design Using Information-Theoretic Criteria","sourcePdf":"tsp-naghsh-2278154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110834S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6601658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6601658","articleId":"6601713","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601720,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqin Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent System and Decision, Wenzhou University, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/6797943/6601720/zhang-2280438-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqin Zhang (M'12) received the B.S. degree in electronic information science and technology from Central South University, Hunan, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2010.","He is currently an Associate Professor with Wenzhou University, Zhejiang, China.

It is important for many vision understanding applications, such as visual interactive gaming, immersive virtual reality, visual surveillance, and content-based image retrieval. However, it remains a challenging task due to unknown image background, presence of clutter and especially the high dimensional state space (usually 30+ dimensions). In this paper, we contribute to human pose estimation and tracking in two aspects. First, we design two efficient Markov Chain dynamics under the data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework to effectively explore the high dimensional state space. Second, we parse the tree structure state space into a lexicographic order according to the image observations and body topology, and the optimization process is conducted in this order. This realizes a much more efficient exploration of the state space than the sampling based search or exhaustive search, and thus achieves a tremendous speed-up. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating and tracking various kinds of human poses, even against cluttered backgrounds, in poor illumination or under partial self-occlusion.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2013.2280438","startPage":"580","endPage":"592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2013.2280438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797943","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/6797943/06601720.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human Pose Estimation and Tracking via Parsing a Tree Structure Based Human Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601720/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Human Pose Estimation and Tracking via Parsing a Tree Structure Based Human Model","volume":"44","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6601720/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14239165","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human Pose Estimation and Tracking via Parsing a Tree Structure Based Human Model","sourcePdf":"tsmc-zhang-2280438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09906S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6797943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6797943","articleId":"6601720","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6601723,"authors":[{"name":"John W.

In this paper, we describe a signaling system co-designed with the interconnect to take advantage of the characteristics of this environment to enable a high-speed, low area, and low-power die to die link. Ground-Referenced Signaling (GRS) is a single-ended signaling system that eliminates the major problems traditionally associated with single-ended design by using the ground plane as the reference and signaling above and below ground. This design employs a novel charge pump driver that additionally eliminates the issue of simultaneous switching noise with data independent current consumption. Silicon measurements from a test chip implementing two 16-lane links, with forwarded clocks, in a standard 28 nm process demonstrate 20 Gb/s operation at 0.54 pJ/bit over 4.5 mm organic substrate channels at a nominal 0.9 V power supply voltage.

The time-delay margin is defined as the maximum time delay under which a closed-loop system can remain stable. In this paper, the delay margin is introduced as an additional performance index for the synthesis of classical WADCs for flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) devices to damp inter-area oscillations. The proposed approach includes three parts: a geometric measure approach for selecting feedback remote signals, a residue method for designing phase-compensation parameters, and a Lyapunov stability criterion and linear matrix inequalities (LMI) for calculating the delay margin and determining the gain of the WADC based on a tradeoff between damping performance and delay margin.

Since the reliability of the nand flash memory of the SSD is seriously degraded as the scaling, the conventional error-correction scheme is becoming useless. Thus, LDPC error-correcting code (ECC) is considered to be the next-generation ECC for SSD. However, many read cycles are required and the LDPC scheme consumes an unacceptably long read time. To solve this problem, the proposed EP-LDPC scheme realizes the 7 \u00d7 fewer sequential read cycles than the conventional LDPC scheme. Instead of reading repeatedly, the EP-LDPC scheme estimates errors from VTH, write/erase cycles, data-retention time, and inter-cell coupling information. The bit error rate (BER) estimation is based on the prerecorded table which stores the relations among write/erase cycles, data-retention time, neighboring cell data, and BER. As a result, the acceptable data-retention time of the SSD increases by more than 10 \u00d7. Additionally, the proposed error-recovery scheme is executed and reduces the bit error if the BER of the data exceeds the error-correction capability of EP-LDPC scheme. Program-disturb error-recovery pulse and data-retention error-recovery pulse reduce the BER of the nand flash memory by 76% and 56%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2013.2280078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2280078","startPage":"2920","endPage":"2933","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6642065/06601731.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6642065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Prediction LDPC and Error-Recovery Schemes for Highly Reliable Solid-State Drives (SSDs)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Error-Prediction LDPC and Error-Recovery Schemes for Highly Reliable Solid-State Drives (SSDs)","volume":"48","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13852150","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601731/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Prediction LDPC and Error-Recovery Schemes for Highly Reliable Solid-State Drives (SSDs)","sourcePdf":"jssc-tanakamaru-2280078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084665S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6642065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6642065","articleId":"6601731","onlineDate":"17 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601737,"authors":[{"name":"Orlando Lazaro","affiliation":["Georgia Tech Analog, Power and Energy IC Research, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6642065/6601737/6601737-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Orlando Lazaro (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Georgia Tech Analog, Power and Energy IC Lab.","From August to December 2009, he was a Design Intern with Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA, where he worked on power management ICs.

Today, receivers store and resonate incoming energy between the receiving coil and an off-chip capacitor until the voltage rises sufficiently high for a diode-bridge rectifier to steer power into a battery.

The 180-nm CMOS power receiver presented in this paper removes the diode bridge, which establishes a minimum voltage below which the system cannot derive power, so that neither tuning nor a resonating capacitor is necessary.

We propose a simple scheme that performs Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward relaying on a per-base-station basis followed by successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the central processor. The proposed scheme has a significantly reduced complexity as compared to joint decoding, resulting in an easily computable achievable rate region. Although suboptimal in general, this paper shows that the proposed per-base-station SIC scheme can achieve the sum capacity of a class of Wyner cellular model to within a constant gap. This paper also establishes that in order to achieve to within a constant gap to the maximum SIC rate with infinite backhaul, the limited-backhaul system must have backhaul capacities that scale logarithmically with the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) at the base-stations. Further, this paper studies the optimal backhaul rate allocation problem for the per-base-station SIC model with a total backhaul capacity constraint, and shows that the sum-rate maximizing allocation should also have individual backhaul rates that scale logarithmically with the SINR at each base-station. Finally, the proposed per-base-station SIC scheme is evaluated in a practical multicell network to quantify the performance gain brought by multicell processing.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","startPage":"1981","endPage":"1993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Multicell Processing with Limited Backhaul via Per-Base-Station Successive Interference Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Multicell Processing with Limited Backhaul via Per-Base-Station Successive Interference Cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601765/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766512","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601765/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Multicell Processing with Limited Backhaul via Per-Base-Station Successive Interference Cancellation","sourcePdf":"1981jsac1013zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083494S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6601766,"authors":[{"name":"Haihua Chen","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Mobile Computing and Pervasive Devices, Wireless Research Center, Institute of Computing TYechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601766/6601766-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haihua Chen received the Master of Engineering in 2008 and Doctor of Engineering in 2011, from Kitami Institute of Technology, Japan respectively.

This paper addresses the issue of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation in Virtual MIMO (VMIMO) systems which adopt SA simultaneously. First of all, we propose a VMIMO scheme for DOA estimation in which a set of User Equipments (UEs) are grouped together to simultaneously communicate with the Base Station (BS) on a given Resource Block (RB). In this scheme, the BS has multiple antennas and can estimate DOA of each UE in the group simultaneously. However, in practical environment because of reflection and refraction of signals, the received signals may be coherent. It is desirable that the DOA estimation in VMIMO could provide high resolution when the number of independent signals is unknown, which can not be achieved by existing algorithms. In order to solve this problem, we propose an Automatic Weighted Subspace Fitting (AWSF) algorithm that can detect the number of independent signals automatically and show accurate DOA estimation. Then with consideration of computational cost and sampling cost while using the AWSF algorithm, we propose a utility factor to determine the optimal number of UEs in VMIMO scheme, i.e., the order of VMIMO. Finally, the performance of the proposed AWSF algorithm and the efficiency of the utility factor criterion are demonstrated by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","startPage":"1994","endPage":"2003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel AWSF Algorithm for DOA Estimation in Virtual MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel AWSF Algorithm for DOA Estimation in Virtual MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766513","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601766/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel AWSF Algorithm for DOA Estimation in Virtual MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"1994jsac1013chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087919S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6601767,"authors":[{"name":"Ouldooz Baghban Karimi","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601767/6601767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ouldooz Baghban Karimi received her BSc degree from University of Tehran, Iran, and her MSc from IUST, Tehran, Iran, both in Computer Engineering.

In this paper, we focus on the user grouping problem in uplink transmission from multiple single-antenna users to one multiple-antenna base station. State-of-the-art solutions mostly target two single-antenna users, solving a pairing problem. Having more than two uplink users in a grouping has yet to be addressed. Intuitively, a higher number of users in a VMIMO group offers better spectrum efficiency, and thus more throughput gains could be expected; the group dynamics however becomes higher too, making fairness harder to be achieved with reasonable computation overhead. To address these challenges, we present a novel solution that decomposes the VMIMO user grouping into two steps. We lighten the computations in user grouping by using instantaneous signal to noise ratio (SNR) as selection criteria, and combining it with proportional fairness for larger groups of users. Lightweight computation in using instantaneous SNR in our solution allows faster grouping and feasible scheduling for a large number of users, as well as fast decision on the efficiency of the number of users in each group. We have evaluated our solution under different network configurations, and the results demonstrate that it achieves much higher data throughput as compared to existing solutions and also well preserves fairness.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","startPage":"2004","endPage":"2012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightweight User Grouping with Flexible Degrees of Freedom in Virtual MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lightweight User Grouping with Flexible Degrees of Freedom in Virtual MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766514","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601767/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight User Grouping with Flexible Degrees of Freedom in Virtual MIMO","sourcePdf":"2004jsac1013karimi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076417S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601768,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyi Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601768/6601768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingyi Hong received his B.E. degree in Communications Engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2005, and his M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stony Brook University in 2007, and Ph.D. degree in Systems Engineering from University of Virginia in 2011.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimally selecting a subset of nodes from potentially a large number of candidates to form a virtual multi-antenna system, while at the same time designing their joint linear transmission strategies. We focus on two specific application scenarios: 1) multiple single antenna transmitters cooperatively transmit to a receiver; 2) a single transmitter transmits to a receiver with the help of a number of cooperative relays. We formulate the joint node selection and beamforming problems as cardinality constrained optimization problems with both discrete variables (used for selecting cooperative nodes) and continuous variables (used for designing beamformers). For each application scenario, we first characterize the computational complexity of the joint optimization problem, and then propose novel semi-definite relaxation (SDR) techniques to obtain approximate solutions. We show that the new SDR algorithms have a guaranteed approximation performance in terms of the gap to global optimality, regardless of channel realizations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated via numerical experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13766515","htmlLink":"/document/6601768/","displayDocTitle":"Joint User Grouping and Linear Virtual Beamforming: Complexity, Algorithms and Approximation Bounds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint User Grouping and Linear Virtual Beamforming: Complexity, Algorithms and Approximation Bounds","sourcePdf":"2013jsac1013hong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149602S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6601769,"authors":[{"name":"Behrouz Khoshnevis","affiliation":["The Edward S.

In the first stage, the users report their best set of base-station antenna and physical resource block combinations, and the base-stations schedule the best user for each antenna in each resource block. The scheduled users are then polled in the second stage to feedback their quantized channel vectors. This paper proposes an analytical framework to show that, under a total feedback budget of B bits, the number of bits assigned to the second feedback stage should scale as log B, and in quantizing channel vectors from different base-stations, each user should allocate feedback bits in proportion to the channel magnitudes in dB scale. Under these optimized bit allocations, the overall sum rate of the system is shown to scale double-logarithmically with B, linearly with the total number of antennas, and logarithmically with transmit power, thus achieving both multiuser diversity and spatial multiplexing gains under limited feedback. Finally, realistic wireless propagation model of an urban small-cell deployment is used to show that the proposed scheme can approach the performance of a network MIMO system with full channel state information with only modest amount of channel feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Channel Quantization for Scheduling and Beamforming in Network MIMO Systems: Feedback Design and Scaling Laws","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131006","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601769.pdf","startPage":"2028","endPage":"2042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Channel Quantization for Scheduling and Beamforming in Network MIMO Systems: Feedback Design and Scaling Laws","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6601769/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766516","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Channel Quantization for Scheduling and Beamforming in Network MIMO Systems: Feedback Design and Scaling Laws","sourcePdf":"2028jsac0813khoshnevis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093064S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601770,"authors":[{"name":"Wenchi Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601770/6601770-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenchi Cheng received B.S. degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2008.

Traditional V-MIMO transmission schemes mainly focus on maximizing the throughput of grouped mobile users without taking into account the quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. In this paper, we propose the optimal power allocation schemes with statistical QoS provisionings to maximize the effective capacity of non-collaborative/collaborative V-MIMO wireless networks, respectively. For non-collaborative V-MIMO wireless networks, the mobile users in one V-MIMO group transmit signals independently over the same sub-channels. In the view point of existing mobile users, they solely occupy the sub-channels. Thus, the existing mobile users employ the QoS-driven single-user power allocation scheme to maximize their effective capacity. By converting the non-collaborative V-MIMO transmission optimization problem into a strictly convex optimization problem, we derive the QoS-driven power allocation scheme for the newly added mobile users to maximize their effective capacity. For collaborative V-MIMO wireless networks where the mobile users in one group can collaboratively transmit their signals, we derive the QoS-driven collaborative power allocation schemes for both the existing and the newly added mobile users. Also conducted is a set of simulation evaluations, showing that our proposed power allocation schemes for V-MIMO wireless networks outperform the other existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601770.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Power Allocations for Maximizing Effective Capacity Over Virtual-MIMO Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Power Allocations for Maximizing Effective Capacity Over Virtual-MIMO Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766517","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601770/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Power Allocations for Maximizing Effective Capacity Over Virtual-MIMO Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"2043jsac1013cheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140359S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601771,"authors":[{"name":"Huiling Zhu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601771/6601771-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huiling Zhu (M'04) received the B.S degree from Xidian Univeristy, Xi'an, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2003.

So far, most researches in the performance analysis for the DAS have been focused on single-user cases. This paper aims to investigate and present an optimal resource allocation scheme in downlink multiuser DASs. Different from the resource allocation in a conventional cellular system, the resource allocation in the multiuser DAS must consider multiple channel conditions of the transmission links between multiple remote antenna unites (RAUs) and any user, which increases the complexity of the resource allocation. In order to provide insights in the multiuser DAS, the effect of the number of RAUs used to communicate with each user is investigated extensively. In addition to power allocation, subcarrier allocation and bit allocation are studied in the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) DAS. To reduce the complexity of the resource allocation in the downlink multiuser DAS, the chunk allocation technique is adopted by grouping a set of contiguous subcarriers into one chunk and allocating resources chunk by chunk to users and an equivalent channel fading factor per subcarrier for a user is proposed to represent the combined channel gain from multiple RAUs to the user. The numerical results show that by using the proposed resource allocation method, each user only needs to be connected to a few RAUs, depending on the location of the user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","volume":"31","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"13766518","publicationDate":"October 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601771/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radio Resource Allocation in Multiuser Distributed Antenna Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Resource Allocation in Multiuser Distributed Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"2058jsac0813zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083835S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6601772,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601772/6601772-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Feng (S'06-M'10) received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively. from 2010 to 2011, he served as a Project Director in the National Science and Technology Major Project Management Office of Tsinghua University.

One of the most challenging issues for virtual MIMO is the acquisition of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which usually leads to an overwhelming amount of system overhead. In this work, we focus on the case that only the slowly-varying large-scale channel state is required at the transmitter, and explore the performance gain that can be achieved by coordinated transmissions for virtual MIMO with large-scale CSIT. Aiming at maximizing the achievable ergodic sum rate, the input covariances for all the mobile terminals (MTs) are jointly optimized, which turns out to be a complicated non-convex problem with a non-closed-form objective function. Further analysis reveals that the coordinated transmission problem can be recast as a Max-Min problem with a closed-form objective function and linear constraints. Then, by appealing to the successive approximation method and the saddle-point theory of concave-convex functions, we propose an iterative algorithm for coordinated transmissions with large-scale CSIT and establish its convergence. Simulation results corroborate that the proposed scheme converges quickly, and it yields significant performance gains compared to the existing schemes. Moreover, it is observed that the proposed scheme can achieve a nearly globally-optimal point under the diagonal input covariance constraint. Since the acquisition of large-scale CSIT is far less demanding than that of full CSIT, we believe that the proposed coordinated transmissions with large-scale CSIT in DASs shed some light on virtual MIMO in the making.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601772.pdf","startPage":"2067","endPage":"2081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual MIMO in Multi-Cell Distributed Antenna Systems: Coordinated Transmissions with Large-Scale CSIT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601772/","displayDocTitle":"Virtual MIMO in Multi-Cell Distributed Antenna Systems: Coordinated Transmissions with Large-Scale CSIT","volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766519","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601772/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual MIMO in Multi-Cell Distributed Antenna Systems: Coordinated Transmissions with Large-Scale CSIT","sourcePdf":"2067jsac1013feng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139579S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6601773,"authors":[{"name":"Fanggang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratoryof Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601773/6601773-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fanggang Wang (S'10-M'11) received the B.Eng. degree in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in 2010 from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China. from 2008 to 2010, he worked as a Visiting Scholar in Electrical Engineering Department, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA.

We design the transceivers at the base station, the relays, and the users. The related optimization problems are generally non-convex and difficult to solve. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to design the transceiver algorithms based on two criteria, i.e. weighted sum MSE minimization and sum rate maximization. Specifically, we show that the sum rate maximization problem can be converted into an iterative weighted sum MSE minimization problem. Low-complexity iterative algorithms are developed for both weighted sum MSE minimization and sum rate maximization optimization problems. However, the convergence points of the proposed iterative algorithms are sensitive to the initial conditions, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. For this reason, we further derive the high-SNR asymptotically optimal solutions and use them as the initials for the proposed iterative algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can approximately double the system throughput, compared to the conventional four-stage transmission schemes.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601773.pdf","startPage":"2082","endPage":"2098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional Cellular Relay Network with Distributed Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601773/","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional Cellular Relay Network with Distributed Relaying","volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766520","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601773/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional Cellular Relay Network with Distributed Relaying","sourcePdf":"2082jsac1013wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150392S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601774,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Zou","affiliation":["Western University, London, ON, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601774/6601774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yulong Zou received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NUPT), Nanjing, China, in July 2006.

For the purpose of comparison, we examine the traditional AFbORS and DFbORS schemes, denoted by T-AFbORS and T-DFbORS, respectively. We also investigate a so-called multiple relay combining (MRC) framework and present the traditional AF and DF based MRC schemes, called T-AFbMRC and T-DFbMRC, where multiple relays participate in forwarding the source signal to destination which then combines its received signals from the multiple relays. We derive closed-form intercept probability expressions of the proposed AFbORS and DFbORS (i.e., P-AFbORS and P-DFbORS) as well as the T-AFbORS, T-DFbORS, T-AFbMRC and T-DFbMRC schemes in the presence of eavesdropping attack. We further conduct an asymptotic intercept probability analysis to evaluate the diversity order performance of relay selection schemes and show that no matter which relaying protocol is considered (i.e., AF and DF), the traditional and proposed optimal relay selection approaches both achieve the diversity order M where M represents the number of relays. In addition, numerical results show that for both AF and DF protocols, the intercept probability performance of proposed optimal relay selection is strictly better than that of the traditional relay selection and multiple relay combining methods.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131011","startPage":"2099","endPage":"2111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601774.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Relay Selection for Physical-Layer Security in Cooperative Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Relay Selection for Physical-Layer Security in Cooperative Wireless Networks","volume":"31","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13766521","publicationDate":"October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6601774/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Relay Selection for Physical-Layer Security in Cooperative Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"2099jsac1013zou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096039S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"416","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601775,"authors":[{"name":"Dongming Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601775/6601775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongming Wang received the B.S. degree from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 1999, the M.S. degree from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2002, and the Ph.

The performance analysis of the spectral efficiency of D-MIMO system is a fundamental problem for both theoretical study and technique evaluation. In this paper, the theoretical performances of spectral efficiency for D-MIMO system and traditional collocated MIMO (C-MIMO) system are studied and compared. First, a composite D-MIMO channel including path loss, shadow fading and multipath fading is given. Conditioned on the desired user position, by using the tight bounds and central limit theory, the analytical approximations of the mean and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the mutual information (MI) are derived for C-MIMO and D-MIMO channels at both high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and low SNR. Assuming that the users are randomly distributed in the cell, the CDFs of the spectral efficiency are also given for the C-MIMO and D-MIMO cellular system, and the closed-form expressions for the mean spectral efficiency, mean outage spectral efficiency are derived. Finally, the theoretical comparisons between C-MIMO and D-MIMO for large number of antennas are given, and simulation results are presented which validate the analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601775.pdf","startPage":"2112","endPage":"2127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Efficiency of Distributed MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Efficiency of Distributed MIMO Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601775/","publicationDate":"October 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13766522","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6601775/","volume":"31","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Efficiency of Distributed MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"2112jsac1013wang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131487S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6601776,"authors":[{"name":"Xuemin Hong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6601761/6601776/6601776-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuemin Hong (S'05-M'12) received a PhD degree from Heriot-Watt University, UK, in 2008.

How these two conflicting metrics scale up in large cellular V-MIMO networks is unclear. This paper studies the EE-SE trade-off of the uplink of a multi-user cellular V-MIMO system with decode-and-forward type protocols. We first express the trade-off in an implicit function and further derive closed-form formulas of the trade-off in low and high SE regimes. Unlike conventional MIMO systems, the EE-SE trade-off of the V-MIMO system is shown to be susceptible to many factors including protocol design (e.g., resource allocation) and scenario characteristics (e.g., user density). Focusing on the medium and high SE regimes, we propose a heuristic resource allocation algorithm to optimize the EE-SE trade-off. The fundamental performance limits of the optimized V-MIMO system are subsequently investigated and compared with conventional MIMO systems in different scenarios. Numerical results reveal a surprisingly chaotic behavior of V-MIMO systems when the user density scales up. Our analysis indicates that low frequency reuse factor, adaptive resource allocation, and user density control are critical to harness the full benefits of cellular V-MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Spectral Efficiency Trade-Off in Virtual MIMO Cellular Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131013","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601776.pdf","startPage":"2128","endPage":"2140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601776/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Spectral Efficiency Trade-Off in Virtual MIMO Cellular Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6601776/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766523","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Spectral Efficiency Trade-Off in Virtual MIMO Cellular Systems","sourcePdf":"2128jsac1013hong2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106363S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601777,"authors":[{"name":"Qing F.

However, the condition for the general case, i.e., a homogeneous K-user 2 \u00d7 1 BC, to achieve the corresponding optimal 2K/2+K-1 DoF remains unsolved and is, thus, the focus of this paper. Here, a K-user 2\u00d71 BC is said to be BIA-feasible if it achieves the optimal DoF via blind interference alignment (BIA). In this paper, we cast this general BIA-feasibility problem in the framework of finding solutions for a system of linear Diophantine equations. Then by studying the solvability of the Diophantine system, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions on the K users' fading block offsets to ensure the BIA feasibility of the K-user BC. Using the results above, we also examine a 2 \u00d7 1 broadcast network with M homogeneous users, in which their offsets are independent of one another and are uniformly distributed over a coherence block. We show by simulations that when the network contains M = 11 homogeneous users, there is more than 95% chance of finding 3 users to form a BIA-feasible 3-user 2 \u00d7 1 BC. Furthermore, increasing M to infinity ensures a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel to be formed from the DoF perspective.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6601761/06601777.pdf","startPage":"2141","endPage":"2153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.131014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.131014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diophantine Approach to Blind Interference Alignment of Homogeneous K-User 2x1 MISO Broadcast Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Interference","Coherence","Transmitters","Mathematical model","Equations","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","interference suppression","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diophantine approach","blind interference alignment","homogeneous k-user 2\u00d71 MISO broadcast channels","BC","homogeneous block fading","BIA-feasibility problem","linear Diophantine equations","coherence block","virtual multiple-input multiple-output channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind IA","DoF","homogeneous block fading","MISO BC","virtual MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6601777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Diophantine Approach to Blind Interference Alignment of Homogeneous K-User 2x1 MISO Broadcast Channels","volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6601777/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13766524","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diophantine Approach to Blind Interference Alignment of Homogeneous K-User 2x1 MISO Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"2141jsac1013zhou2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079895S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6601761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6601761","articleId":"6601777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6601990,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Tam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Tam","id":"37269317500"},{"name":"Alex Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Yi","id":"37074796500"},{"name":"Edmund Y.

The GIS functionality is hard to identify and use without specific training of GIS skills because of the complex hierarchical organization and the gap between users' spatial thinking and systems' implement descriptions. In order to bridge this gap, we propose a semantic framework for designing a question-based user interface that integrates different levels of ontologies (spatial concept ontology, domain ontology and task ontology) to guide the process of extracting the core spatial concepts and translating them into a set of equivalent computational or operational GIS tasks. We also list some typical spatial questions that might be posed for spatial analysis and computation. The principle introduced in this paper could be applied not only to desktop-GIS software but also to web map services. The semantic framework would be useful to enhance the ability of spatial reasoning in web search engines (e.g. Google semantic search) and answering questions in location-based services as well (e.g. iPhone Siri assistant).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780271","htmlLink":"/document/6602049/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Asking Spatial Questions to Identify GIS Functionality","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asking Spatial Questions to Identify GIS Functionality","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5012a106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039151S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6599114","isNumber":"6602019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6599114","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6602019","articleId":"6602049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6602087,"authors":[{"name":"Yasmina Abdedda\u00efm","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique Gaspard-Monge UMR 8049, UPEMLV, ESIEE Paris, ENPC, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Noisy-le-Grand, France"],"firstName":"Yasmina","lastName":"Abdedda\u00efm","id":"37671244400"},{"name":"Youn\u00e8s Chandarli","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique Gaspard-Monge UMR 8049, UPEMLV, ESIEE Paris, ENPC, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Noisy-le-Grand, France"],"firstName":"Youn\u00e8s","lastName":"Chandarli","id":"38475641900"},{"name":"Damien Masson","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique Gaspard-Monge UMR 8049, UPEMLV, ESIEE Paris, ENPC, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Noisy-le-Grand, France"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Masson","id":"37544017000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5054-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5998"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-3070"}],"articleNumber":"6602087","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Time factors","Concrete","Energy harvesting","Scheduling","Processor scheduling","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","energy harvesting","power aware computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realtime fixed-priority scheduling problem","PFPASAP algorithm","fixed-priority energy-harvesting realtime system","battery-powered embedded system","energy storage unit","environmental energy source","scheduling policy","fixed-priority scheduler","energy constraint","timing constraint","feasibility condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["real-time systems","scheduling","energy harvesting","embedded systems"]}],"abstract":"The paper addresses the real-time fixed-priority scheduling problem for battery-powered embedded systems whose energy storage unit is replenished by an environmental energy source.

However, due to resulting cache interference among tasks, the uncontrolled use of such a shared cache can significantly hamper the predictability and analyzability of multi-core real-time systems. Software cache partitioning has been considered as an attractive approach to address this issue because it does not require any hardware support beyond that available on many modern processors. However, the state-of-the-art software cache partitioning techniques face two challenges: (1) the memory co-partitioning problem, which results in page swapping or waste of memory, and (2) the availability of a limited number of cache partitions, which causes degraded performance. These are major impediments to the practical adoption of software cache partitioning. In this paper, we propose a practical OS-level cache management scheme for multi-core real-time systems. Our scheme provides predictable cache performance, addresses the aforementioned problems of existing software cache partitioning, and efficiently allocates cache partitions to schedule a given task set. We have implemented and evaluated our scheme in Linux/RK running on the Intel Core i7 quad-core processor. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the traditional approaches, our scheme is up to 39% more memory space efficient and consumes up to 25% less cache partitions while maintaining cache predictability. Our scheme also yields a significant utilization benefit that increases with the number of tasks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coordinated Approach for Practical OS-Level Cache Management in Multi-core Real-Time Systems","publicationTitle":"2013 25th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2013.19","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 25th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6599404/6602070/06602090.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2013.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Coordinated Approach for Practical OS-Level Cache Management in Multi-core Real-Time Systems","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6602090/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780481","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coordinated Approach for Practical OS-Level Cache Management in Multi-core Real-Time Systems","confLoc":"Los Alamitos, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5054a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084715S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6599404","isNumber":"6602070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6599404","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6602070","articleId":"6602090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6602100,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Betts","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Betts","id":"38070684800"},{"name":"Alastair Donaldson","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Alastair","lastName":"Donaldson","id":"37074279900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5054-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5998"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-3070"}],"articleNumber":"6602100","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":431},"abstract":"The massive parallelism offered by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is now routinely exploited to accelerate computationally intensive tasks in a wide variety of application domains. Efficient GPU programming in languages such as CUDA and OpenCL requires careful application of hand optimisations to exploit parallelism and locality while minimising synchronisation. The effectiveness of such optimisations can be highly dependent on workload and the structure of input data, making it difficult to assess performance in general by testing alone. To address this, we study the problem of estimating the Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) of GPU-accelerated applications. We propose the use of hybrid WCET analysis whereby execution times of small program segments are deduced from traces of execution and a calculation backend derived from the Control Flow Graph (CFG) produces a WCET estimate. Standard techniques which construct a CFG from a binary cannot be applied directly to GPU code because they miss implicit execution paths that arise due the way branches are implemented in hardware - we present a solution using standard compiler analysis. We further describe how to extend the basic hybrid WCET analysis of sequential code so that concurrent timing effects in the GPU execution model are incorporated. We have implemented our analysis as a tool built on top of the GPGPU-sim open source simulator. We evaluate our tool using a set of benchmarks drawn from the CUDA SDK: results show that effective modelling of concurrency is key to reducing pessimism in the WCET calculation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 25th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6599404/6602070/06602100.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"2013 25th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2013.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2013.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating the WCET of GPU-Accelerated Applications Using Hybrid Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Instruction sets","Hardware","Analytical models","Instruments","Programming","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","flow graphs","graphics processing units","minimisation","parallel architectures","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-accelerated application","hybrid analysis","graphics processing units","GPU programming","OpenCL","hand optimisation","synchronisation minimisation","worst-case execution time estimation","hybrid WCET analysis","control flow graph","CFG","compiler analysis","GPGPU-sim open source simulator","benchmark","CUDA SDK","concurrency modelling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the WCET of GPU-Accelerated Applications Using Hybrid Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6602100/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780506","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the WCET of GPU-Accelerated Applications Using Hybrid Analysis","confLoc":"Los Alamitos, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5054a193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073866S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6599404","isNumber":"6602070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6599404","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6602070","articleId":"6602100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6602103,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Bonifaci","affiliation":["Istituto di Analisi dei Sistemi ed Informatica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Bonifaci","id":"38270708500"},{"name":"Alberto Marchetti-Spaccamela","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Marchetti-Spaccamela","id":"38273558600"},{"name":"Sebastian Stiller","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Stiller","id":"38272206800"},{"name":"Andreas Wiese","affiliation":["Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Informatik Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Wiese","id":"37892073900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5054-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5998"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-3070"}],"articleNumber":"6602103","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":508},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Schedules","Analytical models","Real-time systems","Scheduling","Scheduling algorithms","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","real-time systems","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feasibility analysis","sporadic DAG task model","directed acyclic graph","schedulability test","precedence constraint","earliest deadline first algorithm","EDF algorithm","deadline monotonic algorithm","DM algorithm","real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["schedulability","DAG model","Earliest Deadline First","Deadline Monotonic","speedup bound"]}],"abstract":"Real-time systems increasingly contain processing units with multiple cores. To use this additional computational power in hard deadline environments, one needs schedulability tests for task models that represent the possibilities of parallel execution of jobs of a task. A standard model is to represent a (sporadically) recurrent task by a directed a cyclic graph (DAG). The nodes of the DAG correspond to the jobs of the task. All such jobs are released simultaneously, have to be completed within some common relative deadline, and some pairs of jobs are linked by a precedence constraint, i.e., an arc of the DAG. This poses new challenges for analyzing whether a task system is feasible, in particular for the commonly used online algorithms Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Deadline Monotonic (DM). While for ordinary sporadic tasks the required algorithmic techniques are well-understood, despite recent research much remains open in this model. In this work, we completely close the gap between the algorithmic understanding of feasibility analysis for the usual sporadic task model and the case where each sporadic task is a DAG. We show for DAG tasks that EDF has a tight speedup bound of 2 - 1/m, where m is the number of processors, while DM has a speedup bound of at most 3 - 1/m. Moreover, we present polynomial and pseudopolynomial time tests, of differing effectiveness, for determining whether a set of sporadic DAG tasks can be scheduled by EDF or DM to meet all deadlines on a specified number of processors. We remark that the effectiveness of some of our tests matches the best known algorithms for ordinary sporadic task sets, thus closing the gap.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility Analysis in the Sporadic DAG Task Model","publicationTitle":"2013 25th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2013.32","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 25th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6599404/6602070/06602103.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2013.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility Analysis in the Sporadic DAG Task Model","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6602103/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780485","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility Analysis in the Sporadic DAG Task Model","confLoc":"Los Alamitos, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5054a225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091363S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6599404","isNumber":"6602070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6599404","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6602070","articleId":"6602103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6602249,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37707352300"},{"name":"Ryohei Morita","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryohei","lastName":"Morita","id":"37074317200"},{"name":"Yusuke Fujita","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37711596700"},{"name":"Tomoaki Miyatani","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Miyatani","id":"37717458900"},{"name":"Tomohiro Kasakawa","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Kasakawa","id":"37545725900"},{"name":"Mutsumi Kimura","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Mutsumi","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37309652900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6107-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6106-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6602249","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Thin film transistors","Biological neural networks","Inverters","Switches","Hebbian theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","logic circuits","neural nets","silicon","thin film circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","thin-film transistor","interconnect-type neural network","characteristic shift","poly-Si TFT","synapse connection","asymmetric circuit","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["thin-film transistor (TFT)","neural network","asymmetric circuit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602249","abstract":"We are developing neural networks of device level using thin-film transistors (TFT).

This is a result leading to a super-large, self-learning, and high-flexibility system.","doi":"10.1109/IMFEDK.2013.6602249","pdfPath":"/iel7/6590038/6602213/06602249.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"79","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Meeting for Future of Electron Devices, Kansai","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Meeting for Future of Electron Devices, Kansai","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMFEDK.2013.6602249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network using thin-film transistors - Working confirmation of asymmetric circuit -","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network using thin-film transistors - Working confirmation of asymmetric circuit -","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13779810","publicationDate":"June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6602249/","conferenceDate":"5-6 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network using thin-film transistors - Working confirmation of asymmetric circuit -","confLoc":"Suita, Japan","sourcePdf":"IMFEDK2013078PC03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064437S","chronDate":"5-6 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6590038","isNumber":"6602213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6590038","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6602213","articleId":"6602249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6602258,"authors":[{"name":"Chen yang Li","affiliation":["Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Chen yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085813954"},{"name":"Takeshi Yoshida","affiliation":["Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37420881000"},{"name":"Kosuke Katayama","affiliation":["Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Kosuke","lastName":"Katayama","id":"38246635200"},{"name":"Mizuki Motoyoshi","affiliation":["Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Mizuki","lastName":"Motoyoshi","id":"37285265900"},{"name":"Kyoya Takano","affiliation":["Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Kyoya","lastName":"Takano","id":"37535227100"},{"name":"Shuhei Amakawa","affiliation":["Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuhei","lastName":"Amakawa","id":"37298487900"},{"name":"Minoru Fujishima","affiliation":["Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Fujishima","id":"37269469900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6107-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6106-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6602258","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Power amplifiers","Degradation","Temperature dependence","Temperature","CMOS integrated circuits","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","integrated circuit reliability","millimetre wave power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature dependence evaluation","power amplifier","circuit characteristic","room temperature","saturated output power","maximum PAE","PA reliability","PA lifetime","CMOS process","4-stages common source structure","frequency 79 GHz","temperature 100 C","size 40 nm","temperature 293 K to 298 K"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","power amplifier","millimeter-wave","lifetime of PA","temperature dependence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602258","abstract":"A 79 GHz power amplifier (PA) using 4-stages common-source structure is presented in this paper.

To ensure efficient setup of CES connections, ITCS employs a simple mean-rate-based distributed admission control followed by a novel slot-marking reservation. The total connection setup delay is comprised of the setup queueing delay and slot-marking delay. While the slot-marking delay is nearly a ring time, the mean setup queueing delay is formally computed through an accurate approximation based on an M/G/m queueing analysis.

In particular, packet classification demands smaller processing times as data rates increase. To successfully meet this requirement, hardware-based classification architectures have become an area of extensive research. Even if Field Programmable Logic Arrays (FPGAs) have emerged as an interesting technology for implementing these architectures, existing proposals either exploit maximal concurrency with unbounded resource consumption, or base the architecture on distributed RAM memory-based schemes which strongly undervalues FPGA capabilities. Moreover, most of these proposals target best-match classification and are not suited for high-speed updates of classification rulesets. In this paper, we propose a new approach which exploits rich logic resources available in modern FPGAs while reducing memory consumption. Our architecture is conceived for multi-match classification, and its mapping methodology is naturally suited for high-speed, simple updating of the classification ruleset.

A general BRTree-based IP lookup solution features one or more linear pipelines with a large and complex design space. To allow fast exploration of the design space, we develop a concise set of performance models to characterize the tradeoffs among throughput, table size, lookup latency, and resource requirement of the IP lookup engine. In particular, a simple but realistic model of DDR3 memory is used to accurately estimate the off-chip memory performance. The models are then utilized by the proposed methodology to optimize for high lookup rates, large prefix tables, and a fixed maximum lookup latency, respectively. In our prototyping scenarios, a state-of-the-art FPGA could support (1) up to 24 M IPv6 prefixes with 400 Mlps (million lookups per second); (2) up to 1.6 Blps (billion lookups per second) with 1.1 M IPv4 prefixes; and (3) up to 554 K IPv4 prefixes and 400 Mlps with a lookup latency bounded in 400 ns. All our designs achieve 5.6x - 70x the energy efficiency of TCAM, and have performance independent of the prefix distribution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture and performance models for scalable IP lookup engines on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2013.6602306","startPage":"156","endPage":"163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2013.6602306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602277","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589041/6602277/06602306.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Architecture and performance models for scalable IP lookup engines on FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779316","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture and performance models for scalable IP lookup engines on FPGA","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"291569729093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08222S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589041","isNumber":"6602277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589041","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6602277","articleId":"6602306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6602309,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Hsien Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Hsien","lastName":"Li","id":"37074755800"},{"name":"Hung-Mao Chu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Mao","lastName":"Chu","id":"37074389500"},{"name":"Pi-Chung Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pi-Chung","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280431900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4620-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-5560"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-5552"}],"articleNumber":"6602309","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a parallel IP address lookup architecture, which is a novel concept based on graphics processing unit (GPU) via Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).

One of experimental results shows that G92 GPU can achieve a throughput more than 1.3 billion packets per second (GPPS) on IPv4 routing tables with more than 350K prefixes, which signifies CUDA-based IP forwarding engine with the proposed approach has the capability of GPPS IP forwarding rate on a low-end CUDA device. By employing dual data structures, our implementation can support several hundred thousand updates per second. Furthermore, the proposed forwarding scheme is varied to be applied and compatible with other Internet schemes and devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589041/6602277/06602309.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR)","doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2013.6602309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2013.6602309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IP address lookup using GPU","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Data structures","IP networks","Throughput","Hardware","Instruction sets","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","graphics processing units","IP networks","parallel architectures","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU","parallel IP address lookup architecture","graphics processing unit","compute unified device architecture","IPv6-capable data structure","IPv4 routing tables","CUDA-based IP forwarding engine","dual data structures","forwarding scheme","Internet schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IP address lookup","CUDA","longest prefix matching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"IP address lookup using GPU","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779331","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IP address lookup using GPU","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"321569729039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063884S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589041","isNumber":"6602277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589041","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6602277","articleId":"6602309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6602310,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Novakov","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Stevan","lastName":"Novakov","id":"37074209500"},{"name":"Chung-Horng Lung","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Chung-Horng","lastName":"Lung","id":"37271671600"},{"name":"Ioannis Lambadaris","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Lambadaris","id":"37269823000"},{"name":"Nabil Seddigh","affiliation":["Solana Networks, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Seddigh","id":"37444728900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4620-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-5560"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-5552"}],"articleNumber":"6602310","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Wavelet analysis","Telecommunication traffic","Algorithm design and analysis","IP networks","Spectral analysis","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signatures","Haar transforms","principal component analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet algorithms","network traffic anomaly detection","current network","security monitoring tools","anomaly detection","security researchers","statistical analysis technique","principal component analysis","wavelet based spectral analysis","hybrid PCA Haar Wavelet analysis methodology","Haar Wavelet filtering","data wavelet filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Anomaly Detection","Principal Component Analysis","PCA","Haar Wavelet Analysis"]}],"abstract":"The rising complexity of network anomalies necessitates increased attention to developing new techniques for detecting those anomalies. The majority of current network and security monitoring tools utilize a signature-based approach to detect anomalies. This approach must be complemented with other methods to widen the coverage and speed of anomaly detection. In recent years, a great deal of effort has been spent on studying network traffic anomaly detection techniques by security researchers. Those techniques include the statistical analysis technique referred to as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), clustering and Wavelet-based spectral analysis of network traffic. This paper makes three key contributions to advance the state of the art in network traffic anomaly detection. First, we study the effectiveness of PCA and Wavelet algorithms in detecting network anomalies from a labeled data set known as Kyoto2006+ - providing a useful baseline for future researchers. Second, we propose a novel anomaly detection approach based on a hybrid PCA-Haar Wavelet analysis methodology. The hybrid approach uses PCA to describe the data and Haar Wavelet filtering for analysis. Finally, we study the impact of applying the techniques solely to flow-based traffic summary data to detect network anomalies. The experimental results demonstrate an improved accuracy of the hybrid approach in comparison with the two algorithms individually.","doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2013.6602310","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589041/6602277/06602310.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2013.6602310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Studies in applying PCA and wavelet algorithms for network traffic anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602310/","displayDocTitle":"Studies in applying PCA and wavelet algorithms for network traffic anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779303","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Studies in applying PCA and wavelet algorithms for network traffic anomaly detection","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"331569728411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061787S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589041","isNumber":"6602277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589041","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6602277","articleId":"6602310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6602352,"authors":[{"name":"Hamza Bendaoudi","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Abou Bekr Belka\u00efd, Algeria"],"firstName":"Hamza","lastName":"Bendaoudi","id":"37074090600"},{"name":"Abdelhakim Khouas","affiliation":["IGEE, Universit\u00e9 M'hamed Bougara de Boumerd\u00e9s, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdelhakim","lastName":"Khouas","id":"37270854000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5540-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6602352","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Stereo vision","IP networks","Computer architecture","Software algorithms","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","Hough transforms","stereo image processing","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo vision IP design","FPGA implementation","obstacle detection system","stereo vision intellectual property modules","intelligent vehicle","robot navigation","automotive","resource utilization","processing speed","software interface","VHDL code generation","IP parameters","IP-based hardware architecture","V-disparity image","simplified Hough transform","Virtex-II FPGA based prototyping board","disparity map algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Stereo vision IP (Intellectual Property) modules and obstacle detection systems using stereo vision is an important issue in intelligent vehicle, robots navigation and automotive.

Despite its reduced complexity compared to other statistical modeling techniques like hiden markov model (HMM) and its variants. The GMM scoring module still to be computationally intensive algorithm consisting of a series of complex tasks executed in sequential order. This constraint limits its suitability for real-time pattern recognition embedded applications. This paper presents an efficient hardware implementation of embedded GMM based classifier. Reconfigurable system in the form of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is deployed to embed the hardware part of the proposed system. Furthermore a design of exponential calculation circuit is proposed for the best compromise between effectiveness and complexity. Approximations are also developed to reduce the hardware complexity. The developed system performs the identification process of an unknown input pattern over 200 models in 2.3 seconds, our performance evaluation indicates that a speedup of around S.IX can be achieved over an optimized software implementation running on a 3.3GHz core i3 processor.

The proposed method targets a common pitfall of conventional resampling based PFs, in the sense that classical resampling is likelihood biased operation which progressively leads to particle impoverishment and ultimately degrades the estimation quality. The presented method however generates a resampled population balanced between the significant regions of both likelihood and state transition prior. The algorithm is tested with a simulated navigation scenario for UUVs using simplified motion model. Results reveal that by using only a small population size, PSR provides a lower root mean square error (RMSE) of estimation in comparison to that obtained with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and classical resampling particle filter as well as an Exquisite Resampling algorithm. The method is also shown to be insensitive to significant simulated measurement outliers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Mathematical model","Particle filters","Sociology","Statistics","Computational modeling","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","mean square error methods","mobile robots","navigation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","signal sampling","state estimation","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["priorisensitive resampling particle filter","dynamic state estimation","UUV","PSR-based PF","unmanned underwater vehicles","PF-based resampling","likelihood biased operation","estimation quality","resampled population","state transition","simulated navigation scenario","root mean square error","RMSE"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WoSSPA.2013.6602396","publicationTitle":"2013 8th International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications (WoSSPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th International Workshop on Systems, Signal Processing and their Applications (WoSSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589215/6602322/06602396.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoSSPA.2013.6602396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priori-sensitive resampling particle filter for dynamic state estimation of UUVs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Priori-sensitive resampling particle filter for dynamic state estimation of UUVs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602396/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6602396/","accessionNumber":"13779547","conferenceDate":"12-15 May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priori-sensitive resampling particle filter for dynamic state estimation of UUVs","confLoc":"Algiers, Algeria","sourcePdf":"1569700857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057065S","chronDate":"12-15 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589215","isNumber":"6602322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589215","xplore-issue":"6602322","articleId":"6602396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6602406,"authors":[{"name":"Badreddin Koussa","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, SIC Department,  CNRS 7252, University of Poitiers, Chasseneuil, France"],"firstName":"Badreddin","lastName":"Koussa","id":"38547546900"},{"name":"Smail Bachir","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, SIC Department,  CNRS 7252, University of Poitiers, Chasseneuil, France"],"firstName":"Smail","lastName":"Bachir","id":"37586619100"},{"name":"Clency Perrine","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, SIC Department,  CNRS 7252, University of Poitiers, Chasseneuil, France"],"firstName":"Clency","lastName":"Perrine","id":"37399261000"},{"name":"Claude Duvanaud","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, SIC Department,  CNRS 7252, University of Poitiers, Chasseneuil, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Duvanaud","id":"37283533700"},{"name":"Rodolphe Vauzelle","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, SIC Department,  CNRS 7252, University of Poitiers, Chasseneuil, France"],"firstName":"Rodolphe","lastName":"Vauzelle","id":"37269091100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5540-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6602406","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Convergence","Vectors","Cognitive radio","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","conjugate gradient methods","error statistics","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","OFDM modulation","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible OFDM system","peak power reduction","cognitive radio context","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulations","dynamic spectrum adjustment","power efficiency","peak-to-average power-ratio","transmitter linearity","adaptive algorithm","speed convergence improvement","PAPR reduction gain","conjugate-gradient method","gradient descent algorithm","radiofrequency power amplifier","class AB PA","bit error rate","error vector magnitude","BER","frequency 2.4 GHz","power 2 W","InGaP"]}],"abstract":"Systems based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) take advantages of multicarrier modulations.

In this paper, the Tone Reservation method is used to reduce the Peak-To-Average Power-Ratio (PAPR) in OFDM systems. We intend to consider an adaptive algorithm to improve speed convergence and PAPR reduction gain, taking into account the complexity of the algorithm. The proposed approach is based on the Conjugate-gradient method which is a powerful gradient descent algorithm, reliable and efficient on a wide range of optimization problems.

Since the received signal levels in mobile communications are unknown and location varying, the acquisition schemes for pseudo-noise (PN) sequences with fixed thresholds may cause too many false alarms and/or low probability of detection. Therefore, adaptively varying threshold schemes are proposed through the use of a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithms. We propose the use of cell-averaging (CA), greatest-of (GO), smallest-of (SO) and order-statistics (OS) CFAR processors for PN code acquisition in DS/CDMA systems. From simulation results, we observe that the CA-CFAR detector gives good performances in this environment, followed by the SO-CFAR detector. The OS-CF AR outperforms the GO-CFAR which gives the worst results.

In particular, for dynamic flex-grid networks, resource allocation and routing concern both path establishment and allocation of specific spectrum, which in turn relates to the modulation format of the transmitted signals. Moreover, if variable bandwidth transponders are utilized simultaneous optimization of allocated spectrum and transponder reach should be performed. In this context, all the above should be integrated in both planning and operation phases of an elastic flex-grid optical network. This paper elaborates on a methodology for integrating design constraints into the planning and operation of elastic optical networks and investigates the benefits of flex-grid technology with variable bandwidth OFDM transponders regarding both the blocking performance and spectral efficiency when compared to their standard-grid counterparts.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589037/6602671/06602715.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2013.6602715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2013.6602715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning and operation of elastic flex-grid optical networks with OFDM variable bandwidth capabilities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Modulation","Optical fiber networks","Bandwidth","Routing","Bit rate","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks","optimisation","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elastic flex-grid optical networks","OFDM variable bandwidth capability","planning","routing","standard grid","flex-grid technology","dynamic flex-grid networks","resource allocation","modulation format","variable bandwidth transponders","optimization","OFDM transponders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["elastic networks","flex grid network planning","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Planning and operation of elastic flex-grid optical networks with OFDM variable bandwidth capabilities","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6602715/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13778975","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning and operation of elastic flex-grid optical networks with OFDM variable bandwidth capabilities","confLoc":"Cartagena, Spain","sourcePdf":"MoC42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039883S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589037","isNumber":"6602671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589037","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6602671","articleId":"6602715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6602731,"authors":[{"name":"Josep M.

In light of the above we report on the performance of a combined PON-plus-802.11ad network, showing for the first time the interplay capabilities of both standards towards forming extended reach 60 GHz WLANs. We obtained simulation-based throughput and delay measurements both for pure 802.11ad and hybrid PON-plus-802.11ad networks, addressing the dependence of the consolidated architecture on the load, the wireless packet payload and the percentage of intra-Access Point to Internet-destined traffic.

However due to the inhomogeneity of temperature and pressure fluctuations, the intensity of an optical wave fluctuates when it propagates through the atmosphere. Such fluctuation is known as scintillation, which can deteriorate the FSO transmission performance severely. We have recently investigated and analyzed two effective techniques to mitigate the adverse effect of scintillation. These techniques include a dynamic detection threshold (DDT) scheme with coherent detection and a reference continuous wave (CW) light assisted detection technique.

The work is established based on OOK modulation, and a Johnson-noise limited channel is considered during darkness, where the ambient light effect is minimal, and a shot-noise limited channel during daylight. The paper shows that, in order to achieve an acceptable BER at the receiver photodiode, it is possible to maximize the channel link control margin by using an Application- Specific Genetic Algorithm (ASGA). The analysis shows that the transmitted power is not the only penalty, and minimum noise at the receiver photodiode does not always mean a better

Transmitting orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals in FTTH networks permits multi-Gb/s seamless service provision with a unique optical network infrastructure. The use of radio-over-fibre transmission of OFDM signals eliminates the need for re modulation of data format conversion when converged services are distributed. The experimental results demonstrate multi-Gb/s optical access in an OFDM passive optical network (PON) with successful integration of the optical access network and in-building optical and electrical distribution employing bend-insensitive single-mode fibre (BI-SMF) and conventional coaxial cabling (75 \u03a9) respectively. An ad-hoc OFDM signal providing Gigabit-Ethernet (GbE) connectivity can be distributed in FTTH in coexistence with other standard OFDM wireless services such as terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T). In this case, the DVB-T signal can be extracted from the FTTH access optical network and distributed through the legacy coaxial network available in the building, if present. As an additional feature, the proposed approach permits power-over-coaxial distribution. This allows commercial-available low-power DVB-T receivers and USB 3.0 devices to be charged directly from the coaxial cabling outlets. The performance of the DVB-T signals transmitted in coexistence has been evaluated in a FTTH PON demonstrating proper operation. The experimental results confirm negligible degradation on the received signal and successful DVB-T video broadcasting over FTTH networks in radio-over-fibre supporting joint optical in-home distribution and electrical coaxial cabling distribution. Finally, OFDM signals transmitted in the optical access are demonstrated to be adequate for photonic generation of electrical 19.1 Gb/s OFDM-modulated millimetre-wave wireless signals in the 75 - 110 GHz band. Wireless transmission of 16-QAM-OFDM signals is demonstrated with a BER performance within the forward error correction limits.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589037/6602671/06602772.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2013.6602772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2013.6602772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully converged optical, millimetre-wave wireless and cable provision in OFDM-PON FTTH networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Digital video broadcasting","Wireless communication","OFDM","Optical receivers","Integrated optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coaxial cables","error correction","error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical fibre LAN","passive optical networks","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio-over-fibre","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-PON FTTH network","millimetre-wave wireless service","fibre-to-the-home network","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","optical network infrastructure","radio-over-fibre transmission","data format conversion","OFDM passive optical network","optical access network","in-building optical distribution","bend-insensitive single-mode fibre","BI-SMF","gigabit-Ethernet connectivity","GbE connectivity","terrestrial digital video broadcasting","coaxial network","power-over-coaxial distribution","DVB-T receiver","USB 3.0 device","optical in-home distribution","electrical coaxial cabling distribution","photonic generation","16-QAM-OFDM signal","BER performance","forward error correction","frequency 75 GHz to 110 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FTTH","PON","OFDM","radio-over-fibre","75\u2013110 GHz band","DVB-T","power-over-coaxial"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Fully converged optical, millimetre-wave wireless and cable provision in OFDM-PON FTTH networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6602772/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13779074","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully converged optical, millimetre-wave wireless and cable provision in OFDM-PON FTTH networks","confLoc":"Cartagena, Spain","sourcePdf":"TuA46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034097S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589037","isNumber":"6602671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589037","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6602671","articleId":"6602772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6602796,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The obtained results confirm the feasibility of the scheme and its capability of efficiently mitigating the amplitude and phase variations, as quantified by the achievement of acceptable metrics.

The COCONUT network should allow for seamless evolution from present PON architectures, but also support new emerging applications such as mobile back-haul and front-haul. Coherent techniques will hence allow serving a higher number of users, thanks to ultra-dense WDM, and reaching higher power budget, thanks to higher sensitivity. These features should allow for economy of scale and network consolidation. Although coherent solutions are well-developed for core networks, the prohibitive cost of their optical and electronic parts makes them unsuitable for the massive deployment of access networks. To this aim, COCONUT will address realization of coherent transmitter/receivers exploiting low-cost components and simple electronics, so that the cost of typical line terminals would be affordable to the end-users. The paper presents an overview of the target results and key issues that are addressed by the COCONUT partners.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602824/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13779121","publicationDate":"June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6602824/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Towards ultra-dense wavelength-to-the-user: The approach of the COCONUT project","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards ultra-dense wavelength-to-the-user: The approach of the COCONUT project","confLoc":"Cartagena, Spain","sourcePdf":"TuC32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043118S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589037","isNumber":"6602671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589037","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6602671","articleId":"6602824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6602826,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A low intermediate frequency OFDM signal is used to directly modulate a laser, which is combined with an independent unmodulated laser. The generated millimeter wave frequency can be adjusted by tuning the frequency separation between the lasers. Since no external modulator is required, this technique is low-cost and it is easily integrable in a single chip. In this paper, we present numerical results showing the feasibility of generating an IEEE 802.15.3c compliant 3.5-Gbps 60-GHz OFDM. We show that received signal quality is not limited by the lasers' linewidth but by the relative intensity noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589037/6602671/06602875.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2013.6602875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2013.6602875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6602875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-efficient OFDM generation at 60-GHz by heterodyne technique with direct modulation and envelope detector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical fiber communication","Fiber lasers","Optical fiber amplifiers","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterodyne detection","OFDM modulation","personal area networks","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-efficient OFDM generation","heterodyne technique","direct modulation","envelope detector","cost-effective radio over fiber system","low intermediate frequency OFDM signal","millimeter wave frequency","IEEE 802.15.3c","bit rate 3.5 Gbit/s","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio over fiber","OFDM","heterodyne detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6602875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cost-efficient OFDM generation at 60-GHz by heterodyne technique with direct modulation and envelope detector","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6602875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13778998","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-efficient OFDM generation at 60-GHz by heterodyne technique with direct modulation and envelope detector","confLoc":"Cartagena, Spain","sourcePdf":"TuP05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061907S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589037","isNumber":"6602671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589037","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6602671","articleId":"6602875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6602876,"authors":[{"name":"Roc\u00edo Ba\u00f1os","affiliation":["Iteam, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Roc\u00edo","lastName":"Ba\u00f1os","id":"37943731300"},{"name":"Daniel Pastor","affiliation":["Iteam, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Pastor","id":"37270910100"},{"name":"Victor Garcia-Munoz","affiliation":["Phoenix Photonics Limited, Sarre, UK"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Garcia-Munoz","id":"38272113000"},{"name":"Waldimar Amaya","affiliation":["The Institute of Photonic Sciences, ICFO, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Waldimar","lastName":"Amaya","id":"37396520300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0683-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"6602876","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Crosstalk","Chromatic dispersion","Decoding","Optical crosstalk","Optical device fabrication","Optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","channel spacing","code division multiple access","optical communication equipment","optical crosstalk","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibres","spread spectrum communication","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency","WDM-OCDMA","coherent direct sequence encoder","coherent direct sequence decoder","fiber Bragg gratings","crosstalk","channel spacing","chromatic dispersion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent Direct Sequence Optical Code Division Multiple Access (CDS-OCDMA)","Super- Structured Fiber Bragg Gratings (SSFBG)","Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)","Spectral efficiency","Crosstalk (XC)","Chromatic dispersion"]}],"abstract":"We present theoretical discussion and experimental verification of spectral efficiency and crosstalk for different global envelope Coherent Direct Sequence en/decoders used in WDM-OCDMA applications.

In another experiment, a short piece of 19-cell HC-PBGF was used to transmit two 20 Gbit/s NRZ channels using a spatial light modulator for precise mode excitation.

Two optical vortices carrying well-definite values of orbital angular momentum, with topological charges equal to 0 and 1, respectively, are multiplexed in a few-mode fibre and then demultiplexed after a propagation of 200 m. The two vortices are discriminated by means of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with mutually 90\u00b0-rotated Dove prisms in the two different arms, showing an inter-modal crosstalk lower than -10 dB. This demultiplexing scheme can be generalized to a higher number of vortices and it is all-optical, without the need of electronic post-processing. The proposed orbital angular momentum division multiplexing technique is very promising for increasing the capacity of the fibre-optic transmission systems in an energy-saving efficient way.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2013.6603027","publicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589037/6602671/06603027.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2013.6603027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orbital angular momentum division multiplexing in optical fibre","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Orbital angular momentum division multiplexing in optical fibre","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6603027/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13779219","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603027/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orbital angular momentum division multiplexing in optical fibre","confLoc":"Cartagena, Spain","sourcePdf":"ThA14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050268S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589037","isNumber":"6602671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589037","xplore-issue":"6602671","articleId":"6603027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6603053,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, the application is restricted, because the capacity of MMF transmission is limited by intermodal dispersion which is caused by the different propagation speeds of the fiber modes. The free space propagation of radio waves has a similar effect caused by multipath wave propagation. However, to overcome that effect a promising candidate is the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) method which has been rapidly and widely adopted in wireless, wire-line and broadcast systems for efficiently dealing with linear signal distortions encountered when transmitting over fading channels. Therefore, OFDM has recently gained significant attention in access networks. In this paper OFDM signals will be applied to investigate a Radio over MMF link. By using OFDM equalization the dispersion of the transmission system can be well estimated and mitigated, hence the distortion of the multimode dispersion can be compensated. The compensation method will be demonstrated for graded index (GI) and step index (SI) fibers as well. Performance of the transmission will be analyzed; it is investigated for different fiber lengths, fiber types, optical source types; and the optimal OFDM parameters will be determined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion equalization in multi-mode fiber links carrying radio frequency OFDM signals","publicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2013.6603057","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 15th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589037/6602671/06603057.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2013.6603057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6602671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distortion equalization in multi-mode fiber links carrying radio frequency OFDM signals","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603057/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13778978","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion equalization in multi-mode fiber links carrying radio frequency OFDM signals","confLoc":"Cartagena, Spain","sourcePdf":"ThB31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045167S","chronDate":"23-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589037","isNumber":"6602671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589037","xplore-issue":"6602671","articleId":"6603057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6603059,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago Alves","affiliation":["Group of Research on Optical Fibre Telecommunication Systems (GROFTS), Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Tiago","lastName":"Alves","id":"37583601600"},{"name":"Adolfo Cartaxo","affiliation":["Group of Research on Optical Fibre Telecommunication Systems (GROFTS), Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Adolfo","lastName":"Cartaxo","id":"37267961200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0683-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"6603059","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical fibers","WiMAX","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical attenuators","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical crosstalk","passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next generation long-reach PON","bidirectional OFDM","wireless-wired services","bidirectional transmission","OFDM-based signals","downstream link","upstream link","external modulation","direct modulation","crosstalk"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long-reach passive optical networks","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","wired-wireless integration"]}],"abstract":"The performance of the bidirectional transmission of a bundle of OFDM-based signals providing integrated wireless and wired services in next generation long-reach PONs is evaluated experimentally.

Furthermore, in order to evaluate the packet error rate (PER) of the proposed multiservice IP transmission, we derive a bit error rate (BER) expression of a MWML-OOC OCDMA system.

Simulation results show good agreement with the expected trade-off between speed and accuracy, which is common to all conventional ADCs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME.2013.6603107","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 9th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 9th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589036/6603092/06603107.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"44","doi":"10.1109/PRIME.2013.6603107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-step 12-bit ADC based on counter ramp recycling architecture suitable for CMOS imagers with column-parallel readout","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Variable-step 12-bit ADC based on counter ramp recycling architecture suitable for CMOS imagers with column-parallel readout","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6603107/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13778835","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603107/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-step 12-bit ADC based on counter ramp recycling architecture suitable for CMOS imagers with column-parallel readout","confLoc":"Villach, Austria","sourcePdf":"M2A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047808S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589036","isNumber":"6603092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589036","xplore-issue":"6603092","articleId":"6603107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6603108,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Moreover, the calibration circuit shares the same analog circuits of the A-to-D converter, requiring only a small additional power budget and logic for the implementation. The calibration circuit has been validated, testing the overall A-to-D converter after the calibration. A 12 steps binary search is required to calibrate the A-to-D converter (about 2.5ms).

test by simulation. It is dedicated for systems with a differential output. The present approach proposes virtual measurement of the filter performance in the final application. Thus, the source emissions and the load impedance are taken into account. The proposed approach uses impedance matrices to model the passive parts of the system. A matrix calculation permits to associate these matrices and create a compact model. The impedance matrices and the converter output voltages are used for currents and voltages computation at all the system points. Finally, the proposed method is applied and validated on a Class-D amplification system. This method shows good accuracy on the [1kHz-120MHz] frequency band.","doi":"10.1109/PRIME.2013.6603127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME.2013.6603127","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 9th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589036/6603092/06603127.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 9th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Class-D audio amplifier virtual test for output EMI filter performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Class-D audio amplifier virtual test for output EMI filter performance","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603127/","accessionNumber":"13778812","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603127/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Class-D audio amplifier virtual test for output EMI filter performance","confLoc":"Villach, Austria","sourcePdf":"M4A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041883S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589036","isNumber":"6603092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589036","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6603092","articleId":"6603127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6603128,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy Scerri","affiliation":["Microelectronics & Nanoelectronics Department, Faculty of ICT, University of Malta, Msida, Malta"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Scerri","id":"37074474900"},{"name":"Ivan Grech","affiliation":["Microelectronics & Nanoelectronics Department, Faculty of ICT, University of Malta, Msida, Malta"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Grech","id":"37264924400"},{"name":"Edward Gatt","affiliation":["Microelectronics & Nanoelectronics Department, Faculty of ICT, University of Malta, Msida, Malta"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Gatt","id":"37687890400"},{"name":"Owen Casha","affiliation":["Microelectronics & Nanoelectronics Department, Faculty of ICT, University of Malta, Msida, Malta"],"firstName":"Owen","lastName":"Casha","id":"37688258800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4581-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4580-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603128","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"abstract":"In this paper two MEMS structures that are intended to demodulate a BPSK low data rate signal are compared. They are designed in conformity with the MetalMUMPs process. Target applications for such devices would be low-rate, wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) such as those described in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard onto which the ZigBee standard is built. The presented MEMS structures mix the Radio Frequency (RF) and Local Oscillator (LO) signals electrostatically and also filter this mixed signal prior to electrostatic sensing. These MEMS structures can also be used as the building blocks to demodulate higher order PSK schemes. The first structures' mode of vibration is torsional in nature and the use of torsional vibrations for BPSK demodulation is innovative. The first structure has an undamped resonant frequency of 2 MHz. The second structure is an extension of the first and is also supported on tethers exhibiting torsional vibrations. This structure resonates at 680 kHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 9th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589036/6603092/06603128.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 9th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","doi":"10.1109/PRIME.2013.6603128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME.2013.6603128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MEMS BPSK demodulator: Micromechanical Mixing and Filtering using MetalMUMPs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Radio frequency","Metals","Micromechanical devices","Resonant frequency","Binary phase shift keying","Electrostatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","filtering theory","micromechanical devices","phase shift keying","vibrations","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEMS BPSK demodulator","micromechanical mixing","filtering","low data rate signal","MetalMUMP process","wireless personal area networks","LR-WPAN","IEEE 802.15.4 standard","ZigBee standard","local oscillator signals","radiofrequency signals","LO signals","RF signals","electrostatic sensing","higher order schemes","torsional vibrations","target applications","frequency 2 MHz","frequency 680 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MEMS","phase detector","mixer","torsional osscilator","PSK demodulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"A MEMS BPSK demodulator: Micromechanical Mixing and Filtering using MetalMUMPs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603128/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13778850","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MEMS BPSK demodulator: Micromechanical Mixing and Filtering using MetalMUMPs","confLoc":"Villach, Austria","sourcePdf":"M4B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04257S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589036","isNumber":"6603092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589036","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6603092","articleId":"6603128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6603140,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick J.

New levels of programmable systems integration are enabled through the cointegration of digital FPGA die with dedicated analog die such as high-speed analog SerDes on a single interposer. Such heterogeneous integration delivers an industry leading 2.8Tb/s of off-chip serial connectivity. This talk reviews what's driving Moore scaling and how it impacts FPGA technology scaling relative to ASSPs and ASICs.

An experimental cognitive transceiver is proposed based on commercially available components. The complete system aspects of a filterless implementation are discussed. Along with the intermodulation test for LTE specified by the 3GPP, the intermodulation of Tx leakage with the blocker arising in an FDD scenario is also dealt with. It is shown that even with highly linear RF components, the receiver cannot sustain Tx leakage. The blocker performance and the channel filtering requirements for a SAW-less transceiver are also shown along with an AGC algorithm for a steady SNR. With a brief system analysis, the effect of transmitter noise leaking into the Rx band and its impact on the sensitivity are discussed. The experimental setup has the provision to test the impact of full-FDD, half-FDD and TDD modes on the RF performance in a cognitive environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603149/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13778810","publicationDate":"June 2013","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603149/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"System design for an experimental cognitive transceiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System design for an experimental cognitive transceiver","confLoc":"Villach, Austria","sourcePdf":"T1B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049069S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589036","isNumber":"6603092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589036","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6603092","articleId":"6603149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6603150,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Lang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Optical Communications Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Lang","id":"37603928700"},{"name":"Janina Gerigk","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Optical Communications Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Janina","lastName":"Gerigk","id":"37074337300"},{"name":"Damir Ferenci","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Optical Communications Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Damir","lastName":"Ferenci","id":"37591218500"},{"name":"Markus Gr\u00f6zing","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Optical Communications Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Gr\u00f6zing","id":"37283836500"},{"name":"Manfred Berroth","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Optical Communications Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Berroth","id":"37275043400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4581-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4580-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603150","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Synchronization","CMOS integrated circuits","Switches","Transistors","Capacitors","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","demultiplexing equipment","sample and hold circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog current-based 1:16 demultiplexer","integrated sample-and-hold","time-interleaved A-D-converters","CMOS technology","analog-digital conversion","16-fold ADC","size 28 nm","power 0.9 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog integrated circuits","Demultiplexing","Signal sampling","Analog-digital conversion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603150","abstract":"An analog current-based 1:16-demultiplexer with integrated sample-and-hold is presented.

The power amplifier is adopting a tuning capacitor in parallel with the choke inductor, which reduces the DC power consumption of the inductor and decreases the chip size. The total power added efficiency (PAE) is enhanced as a result. The proposed power amplifier is manufactured using a 0.25 \u03bcm SiGe hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT) process. For a LTE signal with a centre frequency of 2.1 GHz, the PA delivers an output power of 21.3 dBm with the power added efficiency (PAE) of 21% and power gain of 19.5 dB at the 1 dB compression point. For the LTE downlink quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM64) signal at 2.11 GHz with 20 MHz channel bandwidth, the measured ACLR is below -30 dBc for the output power of 18 dBm with PAE above 15%. The error vector magnitude (EVM) specifications are met for LTE 20 MHz bandwidth QPSK modulation scheme, and complied with 1 dB power back-off for QAM16 signal and at 2 dB power back-off for QAM64 modulation scheme. The measurement results verify that the proposed method is promising for the application of the fully integrated PA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME.2013.6603168","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 9th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 9th Conference on Ph.D. Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589036/6603092/06603168.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","doi":"10.1109/PRIME.2013.6603168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SiGe LTE power amplifier with capacitive tuning for size-reduction of biasing inductor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"A SiGe LTE power amplifier with capacitive tuning for size-reduction of biasing inductor","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6603168/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13778801","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603168/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SiGe LTE power amplifier with capacitive tuning for size-reduction of biasing inductor","confLoc":"Villach, Austria","sourcePdf":"W1B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139657S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589036","isNumber":"6603092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589036","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6603092","articleId":"6603168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6603179,"authors":[{"name":"Jennifer Manica","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Scienza dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trento, Povo di Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Manica","id":"37074625600"},{"name":"Roberto Passerone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Scienza dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trento, Povo di Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Passerone","id":"37348749400"},{"name":"Luca Rizzon","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Scienza dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trento, Povo di Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Rizzon","id":"37074717800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4581-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4580-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603179","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Throughput","Pipelines","Power demand","Registers","Adders","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-aware architectural exploration","CORDIC algorithm","mobile application","power consumption","battery life maximization","energy reduction","coordinate rotation digital computer","iterative algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603179","abstract":"Mobile applications require the use of specialized design techniques to reduce power consumption and maximize battery life.

A set of rate equations is derived, and is shown to agree very well with a solution of the full master equation model. Using a linearized version of these rate equations, we can analytically express the response of the nanolaser to a modulation of the pumping rate. These results are compared with the modulation response obtained directly from the master equation using a novel method. We show that contrary to conventional semiconductor lasers, the nanolaser is typically over-damped and displays a dip in the modulation bandwidth as the two-level systems become inverted. Both these features can be traced back to the use of discrete emitters that are incoherently pumped.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamical Properties of Nanolasers Based on Few Discrete Emitters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2013.2282464","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3/6607186/06603264.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2013.2282464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607186","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Dynamical Properties of Nanolasers Based on Few Discrete Emitters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6603264/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795236","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical Properties of Nanolasers Based on Few Discrete Emitters","sourcePdf":"jqe-moelbjerg-2282464-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110108S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"6607186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6607186","articleId":"6603264","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6603265,"authors":[{"name":"Vidak Vujicic","affiliation":["Rince Institute, School of Electronic Engineering, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Vidak","lastName":"Vujicic","id":"37062112600"},{"name":"Prince M.

Specifically, the recharging process of the secondary battery, i.e., the most prominent ESS, should be done in a specific manner to preserve its lifetime, the common MG bus voltage must be kept within the bounds, and the energy offered by RES should be utilized as efficiently as possible. This paper proposes a method for coordination of an autonomous low-voltage direct-current (LVDC) MG that consists of a number of sources using power-line signaling (PLS), which is a distributed control strategy in which the units inject sinusoidal signals of specific frequency into the common bus in order to communicate with each other. The control structure that allows the application of this method is revealed, and the optimal range of operating PLS frequencies is specified. In order to achieve a zero steady-state error of injected signals in the common bus, primary control of batteries has been extended with dedicated proportional-resonant controllers that are switched on only during injection period. Finally, a method for coordination among the units using the PLS concept was developed and experimentally tested, confirming its applicability for autonomous LVDC MGs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603267/","volume":"61","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6603267/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14064592","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Control Strategy for Coordination of an Autonomous LVDC Microgrid Based on Power-Line Signaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Control Strategy for Coordination of an Autonomous LVDC Microgrid Based on Power-Line Signaling","sourcePdf":"tie-dragicevic-2282597-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160514S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6730700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6730700","articleId":"6603267","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6603271,"authors":[{"name":"Sudeb Das","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata-108, India"],"firstName":"Sudeb","lastName":"Das","id":"38195121200"},{"name":"Malay Kumar Kundu","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata-108, India"],"firstName":"Malay Kumar","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37269302300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"6603271","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1428},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Neurons","Transforms","Computed tomography","Lesions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["health care","image fusion","medical image processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image degradations","contrast reduction","state-of-the-art MIF techniques","point-of-care health care technologies","complex structure","source image","fuzzy membership values","fuzzy-adaptive reduced pulse-coupled neural network","nonsubsampled contourlet transform","multiscale geometric analysis","MIF problem","multimodal medical image fusion problem","neurofuzzy approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","fuzzy logic","image analysis","image fusion (IF)","medical imaging (MI)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Diagnostic Imaging","Fuzzy Logic","Head","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Neural Networks (Computer)","Radiography, Thoracic"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses a novel approach to the multimodal medical image fusion (MIF) problem, employing multiscale geometric analysis of the nonsubsampled contourlet transform and fuzzy-adaptive reduced pulse-coupled neural network (RPCNN).

The conventional way to deal with this problem is to neglect the interaction between the SRF-PLL and prefiltering stage, and treat them as two separate systems. This approach, although very simple, is not optimum as the prefiltering stage and the SRF-PLL may have comparable dynamics. The aim of this paper is to develop a systematic and efficient approach to design the control parameters of the SRF-PLL with prefiltering stage. To this end, the paper first optimizes the performance of the prefiltering stage in detection of the sequence components. The paper then proceeds to reduce the interaction between the prefiltering stage and SRF-PLL, which is achieved by employing a derivative-filtered proportional-integral-derivative controller as the loop filter (instead of the commonly adopted proportional-integral controller) and arranging a pole-zero cancellation. The suggested method is simple and efficient, and is applicable to the joint operation of different sequence separation techniques and the SRF-PLL. The effectiveness of the suggested design approach is confirmed through extensive experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6603275/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14126503","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Improvement of a Prefiltered Synchronous-Reference-Frame PLL by Using a PID-Type Loop Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Improvement of a Prefiltered Synchronous-Reference-Frame PLL by Using a PID-Type Loop Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-golestan-2282607-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123675S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6730700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6730700","articleId":"6603275","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6603277,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Hsien Liu","affiliation":["Program of Electrical and Communications Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Hsien","lastName":"Liu","id":"38089670500"},{"name":"Wen-Luh Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Luh","lastName":"Yang","id":"37276963400"},{"name":"Yu-Hsien Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hsien","lastName":"Lin","id":"37292127900"},{"name":"Chi-Chang Wu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Biomedical Materials and Tissue Engineering, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Chang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37402221600"},{"name":"Tien-Sheng Chao","affiliation":["Department of Electrophysics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tien-Sheng","lastName":"Chao","id":"37274407800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6603277","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603277","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Resistance","Electrodes","Silicon","Doping","Educational institutions","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","random-access storage","semiconductor doping","silicon compounds","tantalum compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ion bombardment technique","doping","limited Cu source","SiOx-based nonvolatile switching layer","nonvolatile memory applications","current IC manufacturing","transmission electron microscopy","energy dispersive spectrometer analyses","SET/RESET voltages","high-temperature retention characteristics","general SiOx-based Cu filament resistance random access memory","TaN-SiOx:Cu-TaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cu-doped ${\\rm SiO}_{x}$","ion bombardment (IB)","limited Cu source","resistance random access memory (ReRAM)"]}],"abstract":"A novel ion bombardment (IB) technique is presented to dope a limited Cu source in an SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n switching layer (SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n:Cu SL) for nonvolatile memory applications.

The analysis is carried out in two steps. First, a higher order approximation of the surface impedance is obtained for the metal strip through a 2-D analysis of the waveguide cross section. Second, the developed surface impedance boundary condition is incorporated in the mixed potential integral equation formulation of the problem, and the method of moments is employed to find the unknown surface current distributions on the strips carrying LR-SPP. In other words, in this method, the volumetric currents flowing inside the metal are substituted by a surface current model flowing on an infinitely thin strip characterized by the developed surface impedance model. This procedure reduces the number of unknowns significantly, in this way increasing the speed of simulation. Validity and accuracy of the proposed model are demonstrated by analyzing three popular LR-SPP circuits.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2282254","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6605568/06603283.pdf","startPage":"3315","endPage":"3322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2282254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface Impedance Modeling of Plasmonic Circuits at Optical Communication Wavelengths","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603283/","displayDocTitle":"Surface Impedance Modeling of Plasmonic Circuits at Optical Communication Wavelengths","volume":"31","issue":"20","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13796281","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603283/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface Impedance Modeling of Plasmonic Circuits at Optical Communication Wavelengths","sourcePdf":"jlt-gholipour-2282254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083825S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6605568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6605568","articleId":"6603283","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6603289,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwei He","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6690243/6603289/6603289-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinwei He (S'10) received the B.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2005 and the M.Sc. degree from the Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2008.

A myriad of research works have been dedicated to this field due to its increasing popularity in surveillance applications. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of existing state-of-the-art technologies developed for wireless video surveillance, based on the in-depth analysis of the requirements and challenges in current systems. Specifically, the physical network infrastructure for video transmission over wireless channel is analyzed. The representative technologies for video capture and preliminary vision tasks are summarized. For video compression and transmission over the wireless networks, the ultimate goal is to maximize the received video quality under the resource limitation. This is also the main focus of this survey. We classify different schemes into categories including unequal error protection, error resilience, scalable video coding, distributed video coding, and cross-layer control. Cross-layer control proves to be a desirable measure for system-level optimal resource allocation. At the receiver's end, the received video is further processed for higher-level vision tasks, and the security and privacy issues in surveillance applications are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2282613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6336544","startPage":"646","endPage":"660","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/6336544/06603291.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2282613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Video Surveillance: A Survey","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Communication system security","Video surveillance","Video compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","video surveillance","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross layer control","distributed video coding","scalable video coding","error resilience","unequal error protection","wireless channel","video analysis","wireless sensor networks","video transmission","video compression","video preprocessing","video capture","wireless video surveillance system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video surveillance","wireless sensor networks","multimedia communications","cross-layer control","video analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2013","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Video Surveillance: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603291/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13821655","publicationDate":"2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wireless Video Surveillance: A Survey","sourcePdf":"access-ye-2282613-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166303S","chronDate":"2013","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"6336544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6336544","articleId":"6603291","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6603295,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Kamrani","affiliation":["Polytechnique Montreal, Polystim Neurotechnologies Laboratories, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6650036/6603295/6603295-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ehsan Kamrani (M'13) received the B.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from the Shahid Beheshti Medical University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2002, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and control engineering from the Tarbiat Modares University of Tehran, Tehran, in 2005.

SiAPDs are designed in p+/n-well structure with guard-rings realized in different shapes. The TIA front-end has been designed using distributed-gain concept combined with resistive-feedback and common-gate topology to reach low-noise, low-power consumption, high gain-bandwidth product characteristics and it is robust against power-supply variation (1-3 V). This circuit is developed using 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS technology and the measurement results are compared with other results from the literature. The designed rectangular and octagonal SiAPDs have the avalanche gain of 100 and 45 with the breakdown voltage of 9 and 6 V and the photon absorption efficiency of 45% and 25% at 800 nm. Fabricated TIA offers high-transimpedance gain (up to 250 MV/A), tunable BW (1 kHz-1 GHz), extremely low input and output noises (100 fA/\u221aHz, 1.8 \u03bcV/\u221aHz), and low-power consumption (0.8 mW).

The kernel used for support vector learning determines the class of functions from which a support vector machine can draw its solution, and the choice of kernel significantly influences the performance of a support vector machine. In this paper, to bridge the gap between wavelet multiresolution analysis and kernel learning, the closed-form orthogonal wavelet is exploited to construct new multiscale asymmetric orthogonal wavelet kernels for linear programming support vector learning. The closed-form multiscale orthogonal wavelet kernel provides a systematic framework to implement multiscale kernel learning via dyadic dilations and also enables us to represent complex nonlinear dynamics effectively. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multiscale wavelet kernel in identifying complex nonlinear dynamic systems, two case studies are presented that aim at building parallel models on benchmark datasets. The development of parallel models that address the long-term/mid-term prediction issue is more intricate and challenging than the identification of series-parallel models where only one-step ahead prediction is required. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed multiscale kernel learning.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Asymmetric Orthogonal Wavelet Kernel for Linear Programming Support Vector Learning and Nonlinear Dynamic Systems Identification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2013.2279834","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6787013/06603299.pdf","startPage":"712","endPage":"724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2013.2279834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6787013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Asymmetric Orthogonal Wavelet Kernel for Linear Programming Support Vector Learning and Nonlinear Dynamic Systems Identification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6603299/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14221546","pubMedId":"24058047","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Asymmetric Orthogonal Wavelet Kernel for Linear Programming Support Vector Learning and Nonlinear Dynamic Systems Identification","sourcePdf":"tcyb-lu-2279834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090167S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6787013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6787013","articleId":"6603299","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6603300,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (M.A.N.I.T), Bhopal, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6730700/6603300/6603300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Krishna Kumar Gupta was born in Chhattisgarh, India, in 1983.

The 2 WMR consists of two wheels in parallel and an inverse pendulum, which is inherently unstable. It is the first time that the sliding-mode control method is employed for real-time control of a 2 WMR platform and several critical issues are addressed. First, the 2 WMR is underactuated, which uses only one actuator to achieve position control of the wheels while balancing the pendulum around the upright position. ISMC is suitable for control of the underactuated 2 WMR, because ISMC has an extra degree of freedom in control when sliding mode is achieved. In this paper, we utilize this extra degree of freedom to implement a linear nominal controller, which is found adequate in stabilizing the sliding manifold in a range around the equilibrium. Second, the 2 WMR system is in presence of both matched and unmatched uncertainties. The implemented ISMC, with an integral sliding surface and a switching term, is able to completely nullify the influence from the matched uncertainties. The implemented linear nominal controller stabilizes the sliding manifold that is subject to unmatched uncertainties. Third, references design are addressed when implementing ISMC on the 2 WMR. The effectiveness of ISMC is verified through intensive simulation and experiment results.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2282594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6730700/06603306.pdf","startPage":"3671","endPage":"3681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2282594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6730700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of Integral Sliding-Mode Control on an Underactuated Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Integral Sliding-Mode Control on an Underactuated Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6603306/","accessionNumber":"14064554","volume":"61","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Integral Sliding-Mode Control on an Underactuated Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot","sourcePdf":"tie-guo-2282594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098556S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6730700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"6730700","articleId":"6603306","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6603313,"authors":[{"name":"Aria G.

For any such partition of the input alphabet, there exists a corresponding partially perfect channel whose outputs uniquely determine the coset to which the channel input belongs. By a slight modification of the encoding and decoding rules, it is shown that perfect transmission of certain information symbols over partially perfect channels is possible. Our result is general regarding both the cardinality and the algebraic structure of the channel input alphabet; i.e., we show that for any channel input alphabet size and any Abelian group structure on the alphabet, polar codes are optimal. Due to the modifications, we make to the encoding rule of polar codes, the constructed codes fall into a larger class of structured codes called nested group codes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2282611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6670132/06603313.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2282611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"7839","endPage":"7857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Channel Polarization for Arbitrary Discrete Memoryless Channels","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6603313/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13914285","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Channel Polarization for Arbitrary Discrete Memoryless Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-pradhan-2282611-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09715S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6670132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6670132","articleId":"6603313","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6603322,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyuan Guo","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6763171/6603322/6603322-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhenyuan Guo received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the College of Mathematics and Econometrics, Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He was a joint Ph.D. Student with the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Western Ontario, Ontario, ON, Canada, from October 2008 to October 2009.

Two different topologies are proposed. It is shown that two-dimensional (2-D) finite-element methods are inaccurate compared to three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element methods when solving eddy currents in eddy current couplings. The 3-D finite-element transient simulations are validated using a manufactured prototype 15-kW eddy current coupling. An analytical approximation is developed and used for the design optimization of two eddy current coupling topologies. Using the optimally designed eddy current coupling, it is shown that the analytical and 3-D finite-element solutions compare very well and that the proposed eddy current coupling topology has no torque ripple. The analytical approximation is well suited to the rapid design optimization of eddy current couplings that use a conductive material in the air gap.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14064571","volume":"61","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6603324/","publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Optimal Design of an Eddy Current Coupling for Slip-Synchronous Permanent Magnet Wind Generators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Optimal Design of an Eddy Current Coupling for Slip-Synchronous Permanent Magnet Wind Generators","sourcePdf":"tie-mouton-2282602-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074945S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6730700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6730700","articleId":"6603324","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":6603341,"authors":[{"name":"Metin Aydin","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6777358/6603341/6603341-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Metin Aydin (S'98\u2013M'04) is a native of Turkey.

Security is imposed by guaranteeing power balance under each contingency state including both generation and transmission assets. The model is general enough to embody a joint generation and transmission n-K security criterion and its variants. An adjustable robust optimization approach is presented to circumvent the tractability issues associated with conventional contingency-constrained methods relying on explicitly modeling the whole contingency set. The adjustable robust model is formulated as a trilevel programming problem. The upper-level problem aims at minimizing total costs of energy and reserves while ensuring that the system is able to withstand each contingency. The middle-level problem identifies, for a given pre-contingency schedule, the contingency state leading to maximum power imbalance if any. Finally, the lower-level problem models the operator's best reaction for a given contingency by minimizing the system power imbalance. The proposed trilevel problem is solved by a Benders decomposition approach. For computation purposes, a tighter formulation for the master problem is presented. Our approach is finitely convergent to the optimal solution and provides a measure of the distance to the optimum. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed methodology over conventional contingency-constrained models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6603343/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13973456","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy and Reserve Scheduling Under a Joint Generation and Transmission Security Criterion: An Adjustable Robust Optimization Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy and Reserve Scheduling Under a Joint Generation and Transmission Security Criterion: An Adjustable Robust Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-street-2278700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11472S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6684613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6684613","articleId":"6603343","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6603346,"authors":[{"name":"Marek Doniec","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/6616299/6603346/6603346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marek Doniec received the Vordiplom (B.S. degree) in computer science from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2004, the M.S. degree in computer science from Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2013.

This paper presents a six-layer biologically inspired feedforward neural network to discriminate human emotions from EEG. The neural network comprises a shift register memory after spectral filtering for the input layer, and the estimation of coherence between each pair of input signals for the hidden layer. EEG data are collected from 57 healthy participants from eight locations while subjected to audio-visual stimuli. Discrimination of emotions from EEG is investigated based on valence and arousal levels. The accuracy of the proposed neural network is compared with various feature extraction methods and feedforward learning algorithms. The results showed that the highest accuracy is achieved when using the proposed neural network with a type of radial basis function.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280271","startPage":"609","endPage":"620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740874","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6740874/06603347.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ERNN: A Biologically Inspired Feedforward Neural Network to Discriminate Emotion From EEG Signal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603347/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ERNN: A Biologically Inspired Feedforward Neural Network to Discriminate Emotion From EEG Signal","volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6603347/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14111777","pubMedId":"24807454","publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ERNN: A Biologically Inspired Feedforward Neural Network to Discriminate Emotion From EEG Signal","sourcePdf":"tnnls-quek-2280271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173879S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6740874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6740874","articleId":"6603347","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":6603353,"authors":[{"name":"Anbu Selvam Venkatachalam","affiliation":["University of Vermont, School of Engineering, Burlington, VT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6767063/6603353/6603353-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anbu Selvam Venkatachalam (S'01) received the Bachelor of Engineering degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2005.

Concurrently, as process technology scales, the design effort for realizing very large scale integrated circuits and the associated costs are becoming critically high. A possible solution to address this performance/costs challenge is given by customizable multiprocessor system-on-chips. The approach proposed in this paper leads to the customization of multi/many processor system-on-chip at two levels of abstraction: 1) customization through application-specific hardware accelerators implemented on configurable datapath that can target three kinds of structured application-specific integrated circuit technologies: metal, via, and runtime programmable and 2) customization of the architectural parameters of the platform. The proposed platform is equipped with a design framework that assists the user in the high-level design-space exploration of signal processing applications described using the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) language. A peculiar added value of the flow is to support the migration of OpenCL kernels and tasks into pipelined hardware accelerators described using a C-level language. The platform is able to provide an average performance of 90 GOPS on a set of reference signal processing applications, and an average computational energy efficiency of 130 GOPS/W in its metal-programmable configuration. This result shows the benefits in terms of energy efficiency of hardware customization applied to multiprocessor systems with respect to many core devices such as general-purpose graphic processing units, able to provide on average 2.5 GOPS/W for the applications under analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicore Signal Processing Platform With Heterogeneous Configurable Hardware Accelerators","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2280295","startPage":"1990","endPage":"2003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2280295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6881768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6881768/06603356.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Multicore Signal Processing Platform With Heterogeneous Configurable Hardware Accelerators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6603356/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14548144","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MODERN, , which is sponsored by the ENIAC consortium and the Italian government"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicore Signal Processing Platform With Heterogeneous Configurable Hardware Accelerators","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-rossi-2280295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104349S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6881768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6881768","articleId":"6603356","onlineDate":"18 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6603360,"authors":[{"name":"Weiyu Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6657827/6603360/6603360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiyu Xu (M'11) received the B.E. degree in information engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2002, and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University in 2005.

As a byproduct, in this paper we provide sharp bounds on the almost Euclidean property of a linear subspace, using the \u201cescape-through-the-mesh\u201d theorem from geometric functional analysis. When the measurements are nonlinear, we give conditions under which the solution of the iterative algorithm converges to the true state even though the locally linearized measurements may not be the actual nonlinear measurements.

Therefore, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of a uniformly irradiated PV array and the maximization of the conversion efficiency have been the main design issues. However, when the PV plant is connected to the grid, special attention has to be paid to the reliability of the system, the power quality, and the implementation of protection and grid synchronization functions. Modern power plants are required to maximize their energy production, requiring suitable control strategies to solve the problems related to the partial shading phenomena and different orientation of the PV modules toward the sun. Moreover, the new policy concerning the injection of reactive power into the grid makes the development of suitable topologies and control algorithms mandatory. A general view of actual solutions for applications of the PV energy systems is presented. This article covers several important issues, including the most reliable models used for simulation, which are useful in the design of control systems, and the MPPT function, particularly in distributed applications. The main topologies used in the PV power processing system and, finally, grid connection aspects are discussed, with emphasis on synchronization, protections, and integration.","doi":"10.1109/MIE.2013.2264540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/4154573/6603323/06603396.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIE.2013.2264540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Generation Plants: Components and Operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603396/","displayDocTitle":"Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Generation Plants: Components and Operation","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13769803","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603396/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Generation Plants: Components and Operation","sourcePdf":"mie-romerocadaval-2264540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113144S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4154573","isNumber":"6603323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","citationCount":"313","xplore-issue":"6603323","articleId":"6603396","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6603488,"authors":[{"name":"Shinpei Koga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinpei","lastName":"Koga","id":"37085622543"},{"name":"Takafumi Inoue","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Takafumi","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37087869697"},{"name":"Makoto Fukumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Fukumoto","id":"37587346000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5019-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603488","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603488","abstract":"In the area of Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC), some previous studies have already proposed a method for creating music melody. However, in these methods, user's concrete intention or Kansei seems not to be reflected to the created melodies. This study focuses on this point: reflection of user's concrete intention and Kansei in IEC. While most of conventional IEC approaches accepted only user's evaluation by scoring or comparing solution candidates, the proposed method accepts user's operation for solution candidates as user's intervention. To investigate the proposed method for creation of music melody, listening experiments were conducted. In the experiment, the subjects listened to music melody created from the IEC system based on the proposed method. With the system, the subjects can control key of music note in melody by themselves when they wanted to change the melody. As result of experiment, the mean fitness value gradually increased in accordance with progress of generation, and significant differences between the first generation and other generations were observed. The experiment also investigated the efficacy of the user's intervention.","doi":"10.1109/ICBAKE.2013.26","startPage":"129","endPage":"132","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Biometrics and Kansei Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603435/6603439/06603488.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Biometrics and Kansei Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBAKE.2013.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proposal for Intervention by User in Interactive Genetic Algorithm for Creation of Music Melody","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEC","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Music","Sociology","Statistics","Data visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","music"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive genetic algorithm","music melody creation","interactive evolutionary computation","Kansei","IEC system","music note key control","user intervention"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["kansei","interactive evolutionary computation","genetic algorithm","music melody","intervention"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Proposal for Intervention by User in Interactive Genetic Algorithm for Creation of Music Melody","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603488/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780930","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proposal for Intervention by User in Interactive Genetic Algorithm for Creation of Music Melody","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"5019a129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035956S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603435","isNumber":"6603439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603435","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6603439","articleId":"6603488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6603523,"authors":[{"name":"Tomomi Yasuda","affiliation":["Shizuoka Prefectural High School of Science and Technology, Shizuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomomi","lastName":"Yasuda","id":"37074221800"},{"name":"Takeshi Tanaka","affiliation":["A.LSI design company, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37074754900"},{"name":"Nobuyuki Fujimura","affiliation":["Hiroshima Institute of Technology, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuyuki","lastName":"Fujimura","id":"37073965100"},{"name":"Akihiro Yamada","affiliation":["Hiroshima Institute of Technology, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37074129200"},{"name":"Tetsuo Hattori","affiliation":["Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuo","lastName":"Hattori","id":"37269595600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5019-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603523","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603523","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field effect transistors","Educational institutions","Integrated circuit modeling","Materials","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["educational courses","electronic engineering education","field effect transistors","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC design education","education programs","universities","graduate schools","technical colleges","Japanese high schools","FET model","EDX","high school education"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IC design","high school","FET model making","materials analysis","EDX"]}],"abstract":"The education programs of IC design and its related fields are conducted mainly at universities, graduate schools and/or technical colleges in Japan.

However, making efficient use of the underlying spectrum requires effectively assigning the physical spectrum resources to several virtual networks. Since opportunistic spectrum sharing makes wireless communication more intelligent and efficient, we present an opportunistic spectrum sharing based resource allocation scheme for wireless virtualization. First, we formulate the resource allocation problem as an NP-Hard integer program through employing opportunistic spectrum sharing. Then, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to solve it. Simulation results confirm the advantage of our algorithms and show that opportunistic spectrum sharing significantly improves the revenue, resource utilization and accept rate while decreasing the payments of virtual networks.","doi":"10.1109/IMIS.2013.18","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603432/6603600/06603649.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMIS.2013.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603600","startPage":"51","endPage":"58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Based Resource Allocation for Wireless Virtualization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Based Resource Allocation for Wireless Virtualization","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603649/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780887","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6603649/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Based Resource Allocation for Wireless Virtualization","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4974a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094454S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603432","isNumber":"6603600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603432","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6603600","articleId":"6603649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6603657,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Maniscalco","affiliation":["Libera Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Enna KORE, Enna, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Maniscalco","id":"37572851500"},{"name":"Silvana Greco Polito","affiliation":["Libera Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Enna KORE, Enna, Italy"],"firstName":"Silvana Greco","lastName":"Polito","id":"37542445600"},{"name":"Antonio Intagliata","affiliation":["Libera Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Enna KORE, Enna, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Intagliata","id":"37074601300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4974-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603657","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603657","abstract":"Mobile ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are one of the most important technologies supporting Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing (UPC). As many UPC applications pose Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, their implementation in MANETs becomes dependent on the MANET algorithms for QoS routing. In this paper Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for QoS routing in MANETs are considered. GAs can solve the NP search of QoS routes with multiple constraints, and then address the UPC QoS requirements. The focus is on tree-based GAs, which represent the set of paths from source to destination as a tree and encode them through the crossed junctions. They encode single paths in the chromosome. We investigate on the effects of binary encoding schema on tree-based GAs. To this purpose we design a GA with binary encoding that maps classes of paths in single chromosomes. These classes are both collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive. The GA with binary encoding uses an adaptive mutation probability for deeper exploration of the search space, and local search on classes of paths. Simulation results compare the GA with binary encoding with two applications of GAMAN, the main existing tree-based GA. They show that the binary encoding allows the GA to converge faster although it introduces additional computational costs.","doi":"10.1109/IMIS.2013.26","startPage":"101","endPage":"107","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603432/6603600/06603657.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMIS.2013.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree-Based Genetic Algorithm with Binary Encoding for QoS Routing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Junctions","Biological cells","Encoding","Genetic algorithms","Quality of service","Ad hoc networks","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","genetic algorithms","mobile ad hoc networks","probability","quality of service","search problems","telecommunication network routing","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tree-based genetic algorithm","mobile ad hoc networks","ubiquitous and pervasive computing","UPC applications","quality of service constraints","QoS constraints","MANET algorithm","QoS routing","tree-based GA","NP search problem","binary encoding schema","collectively exhaustive class","mutually exclusive class","adaptive mutation probability","search space exploration","local search","GAMAN applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UPC","MANET","Genetic Algorithm","QoS routing","junction tree"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Tree-Based Genetic Algorithm with Binary Encoding for QoS Routing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603657/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780873","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-Based Genetic Algorithm with Binary Encoding for QoS Routing","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4974a101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068943S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603432","isNumber":"6603600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603432","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6603600","articleId":"6603657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6603732,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Gea","affiliation":["Barcelona City Council, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Gea","id":"37074092400"},{"name":"Josep Paradells","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Paradells","id":"37298161500"},{"name":"Mariano Lamarca","affiliation":["Institut Municipal dInform\u00e0tica de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Mariano","lastName":"Lamarca","id":"37074068500"},{"name":"David Rold\u00e1n","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Internet Technologies Unit, I2CAT Foundation, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Rold\u00e1n","id":"37992324000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4974-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603732","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1665},"abstract":"Internet of things is a ubiquitous technology that will be present everywhere.

Smart cities are a novel concept that defines new technologies but also reuses some of the existing ones. All novel solutions phase the same problem: the lack of standards and widely accepted solutions. The City of Barcelona with the collaboration from research centers and industrial partners has been testing the smart city concept with the double purpose to contribute to the creation of standards and providing in the interim a solution to cope with the heterogeneity of providers, in particular from the wireless sensor part. This work has been structured as a \"Barcelona Intelligent City\" project or BCI.

The cognitive radio network is an opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) network which consists of a primary system serving primary users (PUs) and a secondary system serving secondary users (SUs). There are N primary channels (PCs) licensed to PUs and M BCs dedicated to SUs. The PUs have strict priority over the SUs in utilizing PCs and the SUs first try to opportunistically access the PCs not occupied by the PUs temporarily. In case an SU is blocked from PCs, it then checks the BCs to find a free one. The system is modeled as a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain. We precisely specify the state-dependent transition rates due to imperfect sensing by simple recursive functions so that we are able to investigate the performance of the OSA system with imperfect sensing and BCs. Our results suggest that when the SUs opportunistically access the PCs alone with PUs operating in moderate or heavy loading conditions, the performance of SUs may be poor or unacceptable. By using some BCs to accommodate the SU calls blocked from PCs can significantly improve the performance.","doi":"10.1109/IMIS.2013.112","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603432/6603600/06603746.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMIS.2013.112","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","startPage":"626","endPage":"631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Sensing and Backup Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Sensing and Backup Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603746/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603746/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780836","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Sensing and Backup Channels","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4974a626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061309S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603432","isNumber":"6603600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603432","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6603600","articleId":"6603746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6603747,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Hong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electron Engineering, Chienkuo Technology University, Changhua City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Hong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293439800"},{"name":"Ho-Lung Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electron Engineering, Chienkuo Technology University, Changhua City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ho-Lung","lastName":"Hung","id":"37288463600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4974-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603747","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Optimization","Complexity theory","Partial transmit sequences","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR","innovative differential evolution","expanded constellation","convex optimization","tone injection","bit error-rate","BER","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Peak-to-average power ratio reduction","Tone injection","Differential evolution algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, tone injection (TI) based on differential evolution algorithm (DE) is proposed to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. TI is a distortionless PAPR reduction technique, but its high search complexity for finding optimal TI scheme requires an exhaustive search over all combinations of possible permutations of the expanded constellation, which is a potential problem for practical applications. In this work we present a novel convex optimization approach to numerically determine the near-optimal tone injection (TI) solution based on a differential evolution algorithm (DETI). DETI is compared to different TI schemes for PAPR reduction and search complexity performances. The simulation results show that the proposed DETI method provides good PAPR reduction and bit error-rate (BER) performances. Finally, the DETI algorithm not only reduces the PAPR significantly, but also decreases the computational complexity. The simulation results show that it achieves more or less the same PAPR reduction as that of exhaustive search.","doi":"10.1109/IMIS.2013.113","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603432/6603600/06603747.pdf","startPage":"632","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMIS.2013.113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Innovative Differential Evolution Algorithm for OFDM Reducing PAPR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603747/","displayDocTitle":"Using Innovative Differential Evolution Algorithm for OFDM Reducing PAPR","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780845","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603747/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Innovative Differential Evolution Algorithm for OFDM Reducing PAPR","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4974a632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107007S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603432","isNumber":"6603600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603432","xplore-issue":"6603600","articleId":"6603747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6603805,"authors":[{"name":"Barbara Russo","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy"],"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Russo","id":"37314086600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6296-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603805","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Sociology","Vectors","Training","Accuracy","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric classification","error-prone sequences","supervised machine learning","classification problem","feature selection","data pre-processing","cross-validation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603805","doi":"10.1109/DAPSE.2013.6603805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAPSE.2013.6603805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603793","publicationTitle":"2013 1st International Workshop on Data Analysis Patterns in Software Engineering (DAPSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 1st International Workshop on Data Analysis Patterns in Software Engineering (DAPSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596199/6603793/06603805.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric classification over multiple samples","abstract":"This pattern was originally designed to classify sequences of events in log files by error-proneness.

In this paper, the waiting probability of secondary users in the cognitive radio network is analyzed. We consider a cognitive radio network where multiple secondary users (SUs) contend for spectrum access using time division multiple access over idle primary user (PU) channels. Using queue dynamics as Poisson driven stochastic process, we characterize the waiting probability of secondary users. Generally speaking, in practical systems, secondary users of cognitive radio network would have no knowledge of activities of other users, thus the probability of being idle or contention probabilities of SUs' in cognitive radio network have to be assigned according to the available local information. Our focus is on SUs waiting probability analysis, for which a systematic understanding is lacking. Simulation results show that the use of multiple channels and/or multiple slots leads to significant delay reduction and transmission fairness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603860/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13780735","publicationDate":"July 2013","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603860/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Waiting Probability Analysis for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waiting Probability Analysis for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4992a015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050984S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603428","isNumber":"6603811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603428","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6603811","articleId":"6603860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6603883,"authors":[{"name":"Shinji Sakamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinji","lastName":"Sakamoto","id":"37074405900"},{"name":"Tetsuya Oda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Oda","id":"37894155000"},{"name":"Elis Kulla","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Elis","lastName":"Kulla","id":"37593939300"},{"name":"Makoto Ikeda","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37288822800"},{"name":"Leonard Barolli","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"Barolli","id":"37267114100"},{"name":"Fatos Xhafa","affiliation":["Department of Languages and Informatics Systems, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Fatos","lastName":"Xhafa","id":"37283419700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4992-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603883","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603883","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless mesh networks","Temperature distribution","Simulated annealing","Wireless communication","Network topology","Topology","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","telecommunication network routing","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing algorithm","temperature values","wireless mesh networks","cost-efficient broadband connectivity","network connectivity","user coverage","router node placement problem","optimal distribution","client coverage","uniformly distributed clients","WMN-SA simulation system","giant component"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WMNs","Simulated Annealing","Population Size","Number of Generations","Connectivity","Coverage"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2013.34","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603428/6603811/06603883.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","startPage":"164","endPage":"168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2013.34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of WMNs Using Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Different Temperature Values","abstract":"On of the key advantages of Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) is their importance for providing cost-efficient broadband connectivity.

To prevent such congestion, Long Term Evolution (LTE) takes advantages of the group-based policing to regulate the maximum bit rate of all traffic generated by a group of MTC devices. But previous researches on Access Point Name-Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (APN-AMBR) based on group-based policing are relatively limited. This study proposes a multi-stage control mechanism, called MSC, to process the operations of maximum bit rate allocation based on resource utilization information. Simulation results indicate that MSC mechanism achieved a higher overall throughput for all MTC devices. For the purpose of performance evaluation, a M/G/k/k Markov chain was used to analyze the time controlled MTC application in LTE networks. The simulation results revealed that the throughput of MSC is 28% higher than that of the LTE standard model by using the group-based policing.","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2013.51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2013.51","startPage":"274","endPage":"280","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603428/6603811/06603900.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group-Based Control Method for Machine Type Communications in LTE System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Group-Based Control Method for Machine Type Communications in LTE System","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603900/","accessionNumber":"13780680","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603900/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group-Based Control Method for Machine Type Communications in LTE System","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4992a274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065391S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603428","isNumber":"6603811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603428","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6603811","articleId":"6603900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6603911,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hsin Cheng","affiliation":["National Formosa University, Yunlin County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277349000"},{"name":"Yung-Pei Cheng","affiliation":["National Formosa University, Yunlin County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Pei","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38239658200"},{"name":"Wen-Ching Li","affiliation":["National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Ching","lastName":"Li","id":"37088646381"},{"name":"Yao-Hung Huang","affiliation":["National Formosa University, Yunlin County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Hung","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088640109"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4992-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603911","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"abstract":"In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems, due to the environmental impact generated the multipath effect caucused signals distortion and attenuation in transmitted process, and due to relative motion between transmitter and receiver caused the Doppler Effect that makes the signal carrier offset. Therefore, the knowledge of the channel characteristics is very important. To remove the effect from received signal, the receiver needs to have knowledge of channel impulse response (CIR) by channel estimation, and then compensates signals. In this paper, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) is used to estimate channel and compensate signals. Our proposed BPNN channel estimation would compare bit error rate (BER) and mean square error (MSE) with least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithms in an existing OFDM channel environment. From the results, our proposed algorithm has better performance than LS algorithm and closes to MMSE algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex,

power allocation algorithm for multi-relay amplify-and-forward cooperative orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, Conventional power resource allocation schemes based on equal distribution of bandwidth and/or power may not be efficient given the constrained power and bandwidth at the relay node. In this paper, consider a total relay power constraint, we propose an optimal power allocation scheme to maximum the receiver signal-to-noise ratio. Lagrange is used to solve the formulated problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and shed interesting throughput-fairness trade-off in the resource allocation problem. Moreover, it is also verified that the proposed transmission scheme outperforms other transmission schemes without considering non-linear distortion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for Multi-relay Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative OFDM","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2013.65","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603428/6603811/06603914.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2013.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation for Multi-relay Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative OFDM","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6603914/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13780723","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation for Multi-relay Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative OFDM","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4992a356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096904S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603428","isNumber":"6603811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603428","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6603811","articleId":"6603914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6603929,"authors":[{"name":"Akram Ben Ahmed","affiliation":["The University of Aizu, Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Akram Ben","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37085456579"},{"name":"Takayuki Ochi","affiliation":["The University of Aizu, Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37074195300"},{"name":"Shohei Miura","affiliation":["The University of Aizu, Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Shohei","lastName":"Miura","id":"37074509800"},{"name":"Abderazek Ben Abdallah","affiliation":["The University of Aizu, Graduate School of Computer Science and Engineering, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Abderazek Ben","lastName":"Abdallah","id":"37085458614"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4992-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603929","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Probes","Network-on-chip","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer architecture","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","integrated circuit design","multiprocessing systems","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network-on-chip","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-time monitoring mechanism","application-specific NoC architecture","multicore era","manycore era","network-on-chip interconnect","storage buffer","power-hungry components","system performance","power consumption","design decision","architectural parameter","software simulation","theoretical modeling","optimal buffers size","system behavior","RMM","traffic flow monitoring","system resources","run-time traffic information","optimal architecture hardware parameter","PNoC","execution time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Buffer Design","Power-Reduction","Run-Time Monitoring","Design Method","NoC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6603929","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6603428/6603811/06603929.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2013.80","doi":"10.1109/CISIS.2013.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603811","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Run-Time Monitoring Mechanism for Efficient Design of Application-Specific NoC Architectures in Multi/Manycore Era","abstract":"One of the major design challenges of Network-on-Chip interconnect is the storage buffers. They occupy a significant portion of the system's area and so they are considered as main \"power-hungry\" components. Deciding the appropriate buffers size and implementation in these systems is the key technique for increasing system performance and also for reducing overall area and power consumption. However, this goal is very hard to achieve with traditional design approaches, where design decisions of the main architectural parameters are generally made with slow and inaccurate software simulation or theoretical modeling. In order to quickly capture and decide the optimal buffers size and the whole system behavior, we propose in this work an efficient design method for Network-on-Chip architecture based on a novel run-time monitoring mechanism (RMM). The system monitors the traffic flow at different system's resources and sends the monitored run-time traffic information to a specialized controller. In addition, our proposed design method allows to easily compute optimal architecture hardware parameters (i.e Buffer size) and allocate the appropriate values on demand to satisfy the requirements of any given application. The RMM mechanism was designed in hardware and integrated into our NoC system (PNoC). From the evaluation results, we conclude that the system performance in terms of execution time was about 27% better when compared with traditional design methods over several benchmark programs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6603929/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13780756","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6603929/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Run-Time Monitoring Mechanism for Efficient Design of Application-Specific NoC Architectures in Multi/Manycore Era","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Run-Time Monitoring Mechanism for Efficient Design of Application-Specific NoC Architectures in Multi/Manycore Era","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4992a440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06966S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6603428","isNumber":"6603811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6603428","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6603811","articleId":"6603929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6603931,"authors":[{"name":"Trong-Yen Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Trong-Yen","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277268500"},{"name":"Nian-You Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Nian-You","lastName":"Lin","id":"37074676800"},{"name":"Wei-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37074679200"},{"name":"Haixia Wu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haixia","lastName":"Wu","id":"37074097000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4992-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6603931","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"abstract":"In recent years, task placement technology for reconfigurable FPGA has been developed into 2-D arrays.

Unfortunately, the intermittent nature of renewable energy results in a mismatch between when these sources generate energy and when homes demand it. This mismatch reduces the efficiency of using harvested energy by either i) requiring batteries to store surplus energy, which typically incurs ~20% energy conversion losses; or ii) using net metering to transmit surplus energy via the electric grid's AC lines, which severely limits the maximum percentage of possible renewable penetration. In this paper, we propose an alternative structure wherein nearby homes explicitly share energy with each other to balance local energy harvesting and demand in microgrids. We develop a novel energy sharing approach to determine which homes should share energy, and when, to minimize system-wide efficiency losses. We evaluate our approach in simulation using real traces of solar energy harvesting and home consumption data from a deployment in Amherst, MA. We show that our system i) reduces the energy loss on the AC line by 60% without requiring large batteries, ii) scales up performance with larger battery capacities, and iii) is robust to changes in microgrid topology.","publicationTitle":"2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588636/6603992/06604016.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603992","startPage":"219","endPage":"228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sharing renewable energy in smart microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sharing renewable energy in smart microgrids","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604016/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 April 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13778640","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6604016/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sharing renewable energy in smart microgrids","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"p219zhu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112498S","chronDate":"8-11 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588636","isNumber":"6603992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588636","xplore-issue":"6603992","articleId":"6604016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6604046,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The goal is to enhance the current test and repair on-chip infrastructure to detect SRAM aging during system lifetime. OCAS is able to detect the aging state of a cell in the SRAM array. The strategy is based on the connection of one OCAS per SRAM column, which periodically performs off-line testing by monitoring write operations into the SRAM cells to detect aging. The approach is application-transparent since it is does not change the SRAM content after testing.

Among those are fault attacks based on modifying the circuit environment in order to change its behaviour or to induce faults into its computations. There are many common means used to inject such faults: laser shots, electromagnetic pulses, overclocking, chip underpowering, temperature increase, etc. In this paper we study the effect of negative power supply glitches on a FPGA. The obtained faults were compared to faults injected by clock glitches. As a result, both power and clock glitch induced faults were found to be identical. Because clock glitches are related to timing constraint violations, we shall consider that both power and clock glitches share this common fault injection mechanism. We also further studied the properties of this fault injection means.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604060","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589052/6604040/06604060.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power supply glitch induced faults on FPGA: An in-depth analysis of the injection mechanism","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604060/","displayDocTitle":"Power supply glitch induced faults on FPGA: An in-depth analysis of the injection mechanism","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604060/","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779471","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power supply glitch induced faults on FPGA: An in-depth analysis of the injection mechanism","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP1962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064808S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589052","isNumber":"6604040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589052","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6604040","articleId":"6604060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6604064,"authors":[{"name":"Qais Al-Gayem","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Department, College of Engineering, University of Babylon, Iraq"],"firstName":"Qais","lastName":"Al-Gayem","id":"38314628800"},{"name":"Hong Liu","affiliation":["Cambridge Medical Innovations Limited, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37879428000"},{"name":"Haroon Khan","affiliation":["Centre for Microsystems Engineering, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Haroon","lastName":"Khan","id":"37074787300"},{"name":"Andrew Richardson","affiliation":["Centre for Microsystems Engineering, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Richardson","id":"37267571400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0664-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"6604064","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","biomedical electrodes","bioMEMS","built-in self test","condition monitoring","electrolytes","lab-on-a-chip","liquid crystal displays","microcontrollers","microfluidics","multiplexing equipment","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test signal strength scanning","electrode degradation monitoring","biofluidic microsystems","lab-on-chip devices","complex multifunctional heterogeneous microsystems","microsystem reliability","multiple multidomain interface validation","online solutions","fault modeling","impedance analysis","electrode-electrolyte interface","customised prototype array structure","self-test solution","sensing microelectrodes","multielectrode array","MEA","defective sensing electrode monitoring","analogue multiplexer","LCD","microcontroller","real time condition monitoring","built-in self-test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Microfluidics","Bio-fluidic microsystems"]}],"abstract":"Lab-on-Chip devices are complex multifunctional heterogeneous microsystems that have the potential to strongly influence advances in important areas such as pharmacology, security, and environmental analysis. High reliability requirements in many of these microsystems are crucial which makes test more challenging especially given the need to validate multiple multi-domain interfaces and realise on-line solutions. Based on fault modeling and impedance analysis of the electrode/electrolyte interface and a customised prototype array structure, this paper proposes a self-test solution that targets degraded sensing microelectrodes within Multi Electrode Array's (MEA). The principle of this approach is to scan the strength of a test signal over the whole array to monitor the defective sensing electrodes. The test solution has been applied at the system level where an analogue multiplexer, an LCD, and a microcontroller have been used to achieve a real time condition monitoring technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scanning the strength of a test signal to monitor electrode degradation within bio-fluidic microsystems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604064","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589052/6604040/06604064.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Scanning the strength of a test signal to monitor electrode degradation within bio-fluidic microsystems","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604064/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779467","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scanning the strength of a test signal to monitor electrode degradation within bio-fluidic microsystems","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP2374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068638S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589052","isNumber":"6604040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589052","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6604040","articleId":"6604064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6604066,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The SRAM cell's Soft Error Rate (SER) at simulation level is estimated using accurate models of atmospheric neutron induced currents. The study shows that in extreme operation conditions and under random process variability, the SER of an SRAM can reach values up to 3X larger than the nominal value, or down to 2X smaller than the nominal value.

In our approach, support for a large subset of QC-LDPC codes is provided thanks to the configurability of the architecture at synthesis level. High levels of parallelism can be reached, and hence high throughput achieved, due to the modular encoder architecture that takes advantage of the highly regular structure of QC-LDPC parity check matrices. The architectural design has been validated through implementation on an Altera Stratix II FPGA of different encoders related to DVB-T2 and DVB-S2. Very high data rates (up to 28.9 GB/s) have been achieved with still acceptable hardware consumption (about 32k logic elements) proving the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604069","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589052/6604040/06604069.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high throughput configurable parallel encoder architecture for Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high throughput configurable parallel encoder architecture for Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13779442","publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604069/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604069/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high throughput configurable parallel encoder architecture for Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP2891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047205S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589052","isNumber":"6604040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589052","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6604040","articleId":"6604069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6604072,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to ensure correct operation in space, they have to be rad-hard, but most of such components are subject to ITAR. Atmel is the only provider for ITAR-free rad-hard FPGAs, but the default development flow provided leaves much to be desired. The contribution of this work is two-fold: First of all, we present a fully automated flow which improves the usability of the default development flow provided by Atmel, while requiring only a bare minimum of configuration for each design. Secondly, we show how to extend this flow in order to integrate external programs which can be used as in-place substitutions of steps of the default flow. Our experiments show that the proposed flow can significantly boost both the productivity of the designers and the QoR of the final implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th

vulnerable to soft errors. Checkpointing is an effective fault recovery technique that can restore the faulty system to its previous fault free state. Since the function of the system needs to be suspended during checkpoint saving and checkpoint restoring, so the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) of the system is critical to the system performance. In this work, we propose a hierarchical hardware checkpointing (HHC) technique that contains a high-speed on-chip checkpoint and a low-speed off-chip checkpoint to accelerate fault recovery for SRAM-based FPGAs. Most of single event effect (SEE) faults can be recovered by the high-speed on-chip checkpoint, which significantly reduces the MTTR of the system. The memory resource occupation of the on-chip checkpoint is low because HHC only stores the logic states of user bits and check information for configuration bits. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional off-chip checkpoint strategies, the proposed technique can reduce the MTTR of the system by 94.30%. In addition, the memory resource occupation is 11.11% of FPGAs, a little high but can be further optimized.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604078","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589052/6604040/06604078.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HHC: Hierarchical hardware checkpointing to accelerate fault recovery for SRAM-based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604078/","displayDocTitle":"HHC: Hierarchical hardware checkpointing to accelerate fault recovery for SRAM-based FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604078/","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779479","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HHC: Hierarchical hardware checkpointing to accelerate fault recovery for SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP37102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061428S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589052","isNumber":"6604040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589052","xplore-issue":"6604040","articleId":"6604078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6604080,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Soft error rates (SER) are usually determined through accelerated tests where target devices are subjected to very high levels of radiation, in order to increase the number of induced events. Two main factors determine the accuracy of this technique, on one hand, when the number of induced events is low the result is subjected to statistical errors, on the other hand, if the number of induced events is high, the probability that each cell experiences more than one event is increased, as a result there is the risk that a fraction of the events will not be counted. In this paper we propose an accelerated test method to determine the soft error rate in SRAM memories from a model based on the evolution of the cell population being at logic zero (or logic one) during the irradiation experiment. This model has been contrasted with experimental results obtaining a very good correlation.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589052/6604040/06604080.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate alpha soft error rate evaluation in SRAM memories","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Accurate alpha soft error rate evaluation in SRAM memories","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779454","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6604080/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate alpha soft error rate evaluation in SRAM memories","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP39111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057791S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589052","isNumber":"6604040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6604040","articleId":"6604080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6604082,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Nicolaidis","affiliation":["TIMA (CNRS, Grenoble INP), UJF, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Nicolaidis","id":"37332469200"},{"name":"Panagiota Papavramidou","affiliation":["TIMA (CNRS, Grenoble INP), UJF, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Panagiota","lastName":"Papavramidou","id":"38252175000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0664-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"6604082","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Computer aided manufacturing","Built-in self-test","Maintenance engineering","Error correction codes","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","CMOS memory circuits","embedded systems","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECC-based memory repair","embedded memories","SoC","transistors","fabrication defects","CMOS processes","high defect densities","stringent low-power constraints","transparent BIST architecture"]}],"abstract":"Embedded memories occupy the largest part of modern SoCs and include an even larger amount of transistors. As memories are designed very tightly to the technology limits, they are more prone to failures than other circuits. Thus, they concentrate the large majority of fabrication defects affecting yield adversely. Defect densities are expected to sharply increase in ultimate CMOS and post CMOS processes, resulting in high defect densities. These problems will further worsen due to stringent low-power constraints requiring drastic reduction of voltage levels. To cope with the resulting high defect densities in cost effective manner, ECC-based repair combining ECC with spare words becomes mandatory. On the other hand, coping with accelerating aging may require testing the memories during application execution, making mandatory transparent BIST Nevertheless, traditional implementations of transparent BIST do not comply with the constraints of ECC-based repair. To cope with this issue the paper proposes a transparent BIST architecture compliant with ECC-based repair.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transparent BIST for ECC-based memory repair","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604082","startPage":"216","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604040","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589052/6604040/06604082.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Transparent BIST for ECC-based memory repair","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604082/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779441","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transparent BIST for ECC-based memory repair","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP41113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062621S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589052","isNumber":"6604040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589052","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6604040","articleId":"6604082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6604087,"authors":[{"name":"Jeyavijayan Rajendran","affiliation":["Polytechnic Institute, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Jeyavijayan","lastName":"Rajendran","id":"37542437600"},{"name":"Huan Zhang","affiliation":["Polytechnic Institute, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37074285800"},{"name":"Ozgur Sinanoglu","affiliation":["New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Sinanoglu","id":"37273781800"},{"name":"Ramesh Karri","affiliation":["Polytechnic Institute, New York University, USA"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Karri","id":"37269471300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0664-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"6604087","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":739},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trojan horses","System-on-chip","Resource management","Hardware","Transient analysis","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis","industrial property","security of data","system-on-chip","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level synthesis","trustworthiness","system-on-chips","malicious logic","trojans","third party intellectual properties","3PIP","concurrent error detection techniques","CED","operation-to-3PIP-to-vendor allocation constraints","malicious outputs","security constraints"]}],"abstract":"Trustworthiness of System-on-Chips (SoCs) is undermined by malicious logic (trojans) in third party intellectual properties (3PIPs).

However, their high computational demand generates extraordinary challenges for computing systems. Typical high-performance computing systems, which provide sufficient performance and high reliability, are extremely expensive. Modern GPUs offer high performance at very low costs, and they enable simulation applications on the desktop. However, they are increasingly prone to transient effects and other reliability threats. To fulfill the strict reliability requirements in scientific computing and simulation technology, appropriate fault tolerance measures have to be integrated into simulation applications for GPUs. Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance on GPUs has the potential to meet these requirements. In this work we investigate the efficiency and the efficacy of ABFT for matrix operations on GPUs. We compare ABFT against fault tolerance schemes that are based on redundant computations and we evaluate its error detection capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604090","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589052/6604040/06604090.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2013.6604090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficacy and efficiency of algorithm-based fault-tolerance on GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604090/","displayDocTitle":"Efficacy and efficiency of algorithm-based fault-tolerance on GPUs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13779434","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604090/","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficacy and efficiency of algorithm-based fault-tolerance on GPUs","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP49S43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045223S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589052","isNumber":"6604040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589052","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6604040","articleId":"6604090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6604092,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Raghunathan","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Raghunathan","id":"37275475300"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0664-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"6604092","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":590},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resilience","Energy efficiency","Educational institutions","Explosions","Web search","Data processing","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power aware computing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient computing","good-enough results","digital data","input data redundancy","approximate computing techniques","statistical computation nature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604092","abstract":"Summary form only given.

Such applications invariably demonstrate a high degree of inherent resilience to their underlying computations being executed in an approximate manner. This inherent resilience is due to several factors including redundancy in the input data, the statistical nature of the computations themselves, and the acceptability (often, inevitability) of less-than-perfect results. Approximate computing is an approach to designing systems that are more efficient, by leveraging the inherent resilience of applications. We will outline a range of approximate computing techniques that we have developed from software to architecture to circuits, which have shown promising results.

This paper proposes an intelligent approach to the system monitoring and control with the goal of identification of potential voltage instability problems before they lead to major blackouts. The proposed approach is based on detecting alarm states using self-organized Kohonen neural networks, and activating a multi-agent control system to take necessary preventive actions. The Kohonen network is trained off-line and then applied on-line to predict possible emergencies. The proposed clustering model was realized in STATISTICA 8.0 and tested on the modified 42-bus IEEE power system.

Then relevant radiation effects on microelectronics are recapitulated and finally the resulting error rates under various conditions are estimated. The prediction of error rates is based on estimation of upset rates which in turn is used for a prediction of system error rates. The mitigation techniques Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) and configuration memory scrubbing reduce the system error rate to achieve predicted rates that make the construction of this system feasible. Furthermore the system set up of the DPU with a radiation hardened control processor and fixed antifuse FPGA is such, that only tasks are loaded to the Virtex-4 FPGAs, for which sporadic failures can be detected and corrected.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2013.6604219","publicationTitle":"2013 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS-2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589038/6604210/06604219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2013.6604219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst case error rate predictions and mitigation schemes for Virtex-4 FPGAs on solar orbiter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604219/","displayDocTitle":"Worst case error rate predictions and mitigation schemes for Virtex-4 FPGAs on solar orbiter","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604219/","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13779270","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst case error rate predictions and mitigation schemes for Virtex-4 FPGAs on solar orbiter","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.154615S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589038","isNumber":"6604210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589038","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6604210","articleId":"6604219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6604220,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Sterpone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sterpone","id":"37283245100"},{"name":"Anees Ullah","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Anees","lastName":"Ullah","id":"37679250000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6383-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6604220","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunneling magnetoresistance","Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit faults","Random access memory","Complexity theory","Hardware","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit modelling","radiation hardening (electronics)","space vehicle electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal reconfiguration time","TMR circuits","SRAM-based FPGA","avionics","space application","run-time adaptation capability","environmental changes","radiation-induced faults","computational power","partial reconfiguration ability","dynamic reconfiguration ability","single-event upsets","SEU fault model","fault-handling mechanisms","circuit instrumentation method","triple modular redundancy","error detection","domain granularity","selective run-time dynamic reconfiguration","error detection logic","physical net-list","fault identification","fault localization","FPGA reconfigurable area","real-time constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)","Partial and Dynamic Reconfiguration","Single Event Upsets (SEUs)","Reconfiguration Time"]}],"abstract":"Unreliable and harsh environmental conditions in avionics and space applications demand run-time adaptation capabilities to withstand environmental changes and radiation-induced faults. Modern SRAM-based FPGAs integrating high computational power with partial and dynamic reconfiguration abilities are a usual candidate for such systems. However, due to the vulnerability of these devices to Single Event Upsets (SEUs), designs need proper fault-handling mechanisms. In this work we propose a novel circuit instrumentation method for probing Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) circuits for error detection at the granularity of individual domains and then use selective run-time dynamic reconfiguration for recovery. Error detection logic is inserted in the physical net-list to identify and localize faults. Moreover, selective domain reconfiguration is achieved by careful considerations in the placement phase on the FPGA reconfigurable area. The proposed technique is suitable for systems having hard real-time constraints. Our results demonstrate that this approach has an overhead of 2 LUTs per majority voter in internal partitions in terms of area when compared to the standard TMR circuits. In addition, it brings down the reconfiguration times of TMR circuits to a single domain and ensures a 100% availability of the device assuming the Single Event Upset fault model.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2013.6604220","publicationTitle":"2013 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS-2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589038/6604210/06604220.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2013.6604220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the optimal reconfiguration times for TMR circuits on SRAM based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604220/","displayDocTitle":"On the optimal reconfiguration times for TMR circuits on SRAM based FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604220/","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13779272","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the optimal reconfiguration times for TMR circuits on SRAM based FPGAs","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052145S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589038","isNumber":"6604210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589038","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6604210","articleId":"6604220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6604221,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Siegle","affiliation":["University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Siegle","id":"37074108500"},{"name":"Tanya Vladimirova","affiliation":["University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Tanya","lastName":"Vladimirova","id":"37073993600"},{"name":"Omar Emam","affiliation":["Astrium, Stevenage, UK"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Emam","id":"37074505900"},{"name":"J\u00f8rgen Ilstad","affiliation":["ESTEC, European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"J\u00f8rgen","lastName":"Ilstad","id":"37706042800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6383-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6604221","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Availability","Field programmable gate arrays","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Redundancy","Payloads","Maintenance engineering","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","data handling","fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","network-on-chip","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive FDIR framework","payload data processing system","reconfigurable FPGA","fault detection-isolation-and-recovery approach","SRAM-based FPGA","static random access memory","field programmable gate array","distributed failure detection technique","network-on-chip implementation","failure detection mechanism","network routing switch"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery approach to SRAM-based FPGAs in payload data processing applications on-board spacecraft is presented.

Thus, it should be removed to improve the robustness of the entire processing flow. The noise estimation in an image is also a key factor, since, to be more effective, algorithms and denoising filters should be tuned to the actual level of noise. Moreover, the complexity of these algorithms brings a new challenge in real-time image processing applications, requiring high computing capacity. In this context, hardware acceleration is crucial, and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) best fit the growing demand of computational capabilities. This paper presents an Adaptive Image Denoising IP-core (AIDI) for real-time applications. The core first estimates the level of noise in the input image, then applies an adaptive Gaussian smoothing filter to remove the estimated noise. The filtering parameters are computed on-the-fly, adapting them to the level of noise in the image, and pixel by pixel, to preserve image information (e.g., edges or corners). The FPGA-based architecture is presented, highlighting its improvements w.r.t. a standard static filtering approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13779267","htmlLink":"/document/6604232/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"AIDI: An adaptive image denoising FPGA-based IP-core for real-time applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AIDI: An adaptive image denoising FPGA-based IP-core for real-time applications","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085443S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589038","isNumber":"6604210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589038","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6604210","articleId":"6604232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":6604233,"authors":[{"name":"Lucana Santos","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Microelectronics, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain"],"firstName":"Lucana","lastName":"Santos","id":"38243609900"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Fco.

However, the traditional RTL design flow is rather time-consuming. High-level synthesis (HLS) tools, like the well-known CatapultC, can help to shorten these times. Utilizing CatapultC, we obtain an FPGA implementation of the lossy compression algorithm directly from a source code written in C language with a double motivation: demonstrating how well the lossy compression algorithm would perform on an FPGA in terms of throughput and area; and at the same time showing how HLS is applied, in terms of source code preparation and CatapultC settings, to obtain an efficient hardware implementation in a relatively short time. The P&R on a Virtex 5 5VFX130 displays effective performance terms of area (maximum device utilization at 14%) and frequency (80 MHz). A comparison with a previous FPGA implementation of a lossless to near-lossless algorithm is also provided. Results on a Virtex 4 4VLX200 show less memory requirements and higher frequency for the LCE algorithm.","publicationTitle":"2013 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS-2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589038/6604210/06604233.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of a lossy compression algorithm for hyperspectral images with a high-level synthesis tool","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2013.6604233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2013.6604233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of a lossy compression algorithm for hyperspectral images with a high-level synthesis tool","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13779291","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6604233/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of a lossy compression algorithm for hyperspectral images with a high-level synthesis tool","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06354S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589038","isNumber":"6604210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589038","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6604210","articleId":"6604233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6604236,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) were introduced in the last decade as possible physical unclonable security anchors. So far, PUFs as analog units exhibited relative inconsistency due to variations in the operating conditions such as temperature, supply voltage, aging and other possible environmental effects. This lead to relatively high unit's implementation complexity. This work introduces a consistent pure-digital PUF concept. The proposed digital PUF is a combined Hardware-Software (HW-SW) module, embedded in a System-on-Chip (SoC) device. The key idea is based on triggering an internal true random process, which creates a hard to predict combined digital HW-SW module. Modern Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) SoC-devices often incorporate embedded processors in addition to self-reconfiguring hardware cell-arrays. Such combined self-reconfiguring HW-SW architectures allow practical self-creation of clone-resistant digital PUF modules. As pure-digital units, they exhibit negligible sensitivity to both operation conditions and aging factors. We postulate that self-creation of pure-hardware architectures is highly complex in self-reconfiguring FPGA environment. Therefore a combination of both hardware and software is expected to allow more sophisticated and secure functions with higher robustness against Side Channel Attacks (SCAs). It is assumed that any system is basically clonable, if sufficient financial and technical investments are offered. In the proposed concept, each created digital PUF results with its own unknown and hard to predict individual structure. Therefore, to clone any single digital PUF, an individual attack procedure is needed. In that case, mass-cloning tends to become impractical. As a result, cloning attacks on the proposed system are not economic and hence practically useless. The resulting proposed system, when adequately implemented, offers a practical low-cost security anchor for a large class of modern applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589038/6604210/06604236.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"137","publicationTitle":"2013 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS-2013)","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2013.6604236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2013.6604236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined HW-SW adaptive clone-resistant functions as physical security anchors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Security","Resistance","Cloning","System-on-chip","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HW-SW adaptive clone-resistant function","hardware-software module","physical security anchor","physical unclonable function","PUF","system-on-chip","SoC device","FPGA environment","field programmable gate array","side channel attacks","SCA","digital PUF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital Physical Unclonable Functions","Clone-Resistant HW-SW units","Side Channel Attack resistance units","Adaptive HW-SW Co-Design","SCARE resistance units"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Combined HW-SW adaptive clone-resistant functions as physical security anchors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604236/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13779288","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined HW-SW adaptive clone-resistant functions as physical security anchors","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067662S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589038","isNumber":"6604210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589038","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6604210","articleId":"6604236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6604241,"authors":[{"name":"Roland Dobai","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, IT4 Innovations Centre of Excellence Brno, Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Dobai","id":"37681916400"},{"name":"Lukas Sekanina","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, IT4 Innovations Centre of Excellence Brno, Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Sekanina","id":"37272319600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6383-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6604241","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":785},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","System-on-chip","Biological cells","Switches","Read only memory","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","filtering theory","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image filter evolution","Xilinx Zynq platform","reconfigurable chips","Zynq-7000 all programmable system-on-chip","switching image filter design","dynamic partial reconfiguration","field programmable gate array"]}],"abstract":"The limitations of reconfigurable chips have always raised barriers for evolvable hardware.

Therefore, power flow originally developed for the passive distribution system needs to account for a DG unit, which can operate either in PV or PQ control mode. Nevertheless, modifications previously proposed can only handle a limited number of PV buses. This paper presents a new robust three-phase distribution power flow, which incorporates the particle swarm optimization method into a Forward-Backward type method to handle a radial system with high R/X and high number of PV buses. Simulation and experimental results have validated the robustness and suitability of the proposed method to operate in a real microgrid system.","doi":"10.1109/ISNCC.2013.6604452","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"International School on Nonsinusoidal Currents and Compensation 2013 (ISNCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6590066/6604440/06604452.pdf","publicationTitle":"International School on Nonsinusoidal Currents and Compensation 2013 (ISNCC 2013)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNCC.2013.6604452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust microgrid power flow using particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Microgrids","Reactive power","Robustness","Voltage measurement","Educational institutions","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","load flow control","particle swarm optimisation","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust microgrid power flow","robust three-phase distribution power flow","particle swarm optimization","distributed generators","radial distribution system","PV control mode","PQ control mode","forward-backward type method","PV buses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Generation","PV Buses","Power Flow","Particle Swarm Optimization","Radial Distribution Systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust microgrid power flow using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604452/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","conferenceDate":"20-21 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13848026","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust microgrid power flow using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Zielona Gora, Poland","sourcePdf":"RobustMicrogridPowerFlowusingParticleSwarmOpt.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070827S","chronDate":"20-21 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6590066","isNumber":"6604440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6590066","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6604440","articleId":"6604452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6604470,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Mohsen Sadatiyan Abkenar","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, US"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohsen Sadatiyan","lastName":"Abkenar","id":"37074458700"},{"name":"Donald V.

Pumps are often the greatest energy consumer in water distribution systems. Optimizing the working schedule of these pumps has the potential to significantly decrease operation costs of these systems. It is also possible to optimize for environmental concerns and arrive at the least polluting solution of pump operation that meets system-wide hydraulic demands. As with water usage, electrical usage varies over the course of the day. Electrical utilities must satisfy the daily power demand which, in turn, may result in using different types of electrical generators - some of which vary in their environmental impact. By scheduling energy consumption at times that correspond to the least polluting generators on-line, water distribution systems can become more environmentally sustainable. Optimizing energy consumption and working schedule of pumps is a multi-objective nonlinear problem that contains considerable amount of constraints. The solution space of this type of problem even for a small water network can be very large and finding the boundaries associated with the solution space is quite difficult. Evolutionary optimization methods, such as genetic algorithm (GA), are well suited for solving this kind of problem. In this paper, two methods for describing the pump optimization problem within a GA solution framework are considered. Each leads to different methods for conducting crossover and mutation steps of the GA. Advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. In terms of sustainable computing, the effect of each method on computer storage and computing requirement is investigated. Novel GA coding methods which circumvent infeasible solutions that may arise with this specific type of problem are discussed as well as other associated issues.","doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2013.6604470","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Green Computing Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589045/6604459/06604470.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Green Computing Conference Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2013.6604470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing pumping system for sustainable water distribution network by using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Schedules","Water pollution","Biological cells","Arrays","Mathematical model","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","genetic algorithms","nonlinear programming","pumps","scheduling","water supply"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GA coding methods","GA solution framework","evolutionary optimization methods","multiobjective nonlinear problem","online water distribution systems","polluting generators","energy consumption scheduling","environmental impact","electrical generators","electrical utilities","system-wide hydraulic demands","water distribution cost","genetic algorithm","sustainable water distribution network","optimizing pumping system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimization","Sustainable","Water distribution system","Pump","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing pumping system for sustainable water distribution network by using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604470/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13847585","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing pumping system for sustainable water distribution network by using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"13SyedAbkenarOptimizingpumpingsystemfors.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046441S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589045","isNumber":"6604459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589045","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6604459","articleId":"6604470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6604480,"authors":[{"name":"Hooman Rashtian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Hooman","lastName":"Rashtian","id":"37543238300"},{"name":"Shahriar Mirabbasi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahriar","lastName":"Mirabbasi","id":"37269465100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0623-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6604480","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":590},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604480","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Capacitance","Logic gates","MOSFET","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","distortion","microwave integrated circuits","microwave power amplifiers","MOS capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-AB power amplifier","body-biased NMOS predistortion stage","CMOS power amplifier","voltage-dependent nonlinear gate-source capacitance","NMOS capacitor","nonlinearity cancellation","body biasing","CMOS technology","post layout simulation","third order input referred intercept point","predistortion device","frequency 2.4 GHz","size 0.13 mum","current 125 mA","voltage 1.2 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","class-AB","CMOS PA","linearity","body biasing","predistortion"]}],"abstract":"A technique for improving the linearity of CMOS class-AB power amplifiers (PAs) is introduced. The technique is based on compensating for the voltage-dependent nonlinear gate-source capacitance of the input transistor of the PA. This compensation is achieved through using an NMOS capacitor, i.e., an NMOS transistor with its source and drain shorted, as a predistortion stage. To enhance cancellation of the nonlinearity, body biasing is incorporated as an additional control scheme into the predistortion stage. As a proof-of-concept, a 2.4-GHz class-AB power amplifier with the proposed predistortion stage has been designed and laid out in a 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS technology. Post-layout simulation results show that the third-order input-referred intercept point (IIP3) of the designed PA improves by more than 3-dB when the bulk voltage of the predistortion device is biased appropriately. The PA achieves unsaturated output power of +20 dBm while drawing 125 mA from a 1.2 V supply voltage.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2013.6604480","publicationTitle":"2013 International Green Computing Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Green Computing Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589045/6604459/06604480.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2013.6604480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving linearity in class-AB power amplifiers using a body-biased NMOS predistortion stage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Improving linearity in class-AB power amplifiers using a body-biased NMOS predistortion stage","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6604480/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13847601","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604480/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving linearity in class-AB power amplifiers using a body-biased NMOS predistortion stage","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"20ShahriarMirabbasiImprovingLinearityinC.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056893S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589045","isNumber":"6604459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589045","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6604459","articleId":"6604480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6604509,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Magno","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Magno","id":"37601742500"},{"name":"Danilo Porcarelli","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Porcarelli","id":"38269364300"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"},{"name":"Davide Brunelli","affiliation":["University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Brunelli","id":"37543052100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0623-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6604509","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuel cells","Batteries","Wireless sensor networks","Hydrogen","Microcontrollers","Power measurement","Maximum power point trackers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","energy harvesting","fuel cells","hybrid power systems","power integrated circuits","secondary cells","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perpetual energy sustainability","Switzerland","structural health monitoring","power conversion subsystem","power management","power information","serial communication","standard battery","energy harvesters","smart power unit","mobile electronics","ubiquitously deployed sensor networks","energy harvesting","embedded devices","wireless sensor networks","long term operation","energy availability","outdoor applications","embedded systems","hydrogen fuel cell","power-aware multiharvester power unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","fuel cells","hybrid power systems","wireless sensor networks","self sustenability"]}],"abstract":"Energy availability and long term operation are key challenges for wireless sensor networks and the applications where embedded devices are battery-operated and they should operate unattended for tens of years.

In the proposed approach, a CS algorithm based on an alternating minimization (AM) procedure is adopted to extract the information about both the system impulse response and the reflectivity function. The implemented tool exploits the dispersion compensation properties of the warped frequency transform as a means to generate the sparsifying basis for the signal representation. The effectiveness of the decomposition task is demonstrated on synthetic signals and successfully tested on experimental Lamb waves propagating in an aluminum plate.

A new two-stage approach based on the finite element method is proposed to examine the performance of such devices. First, detailed electrostatic poling simulations are presented. The results of these poling orientation simulations are used while calculating electrical energy and conversion efficiency in response to a constant external force. The proposed approach is used to find the optimum piezoelectric material thickness and IDE geometry for a cantilever beam which is constructed on top of a 4-\u03bcm Si structural layer and a 1-\u03bcm SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n isolation layer. Cantilever and IDE lengths are fixed at 320 \u03bcm and 240 \u03bcm, respectively, whereas the lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thickness, IDE finger widths, and number of finger pairs are varied. Maximum output energy of 0.37 pJ for a 15-\u03bcN force is obtained at a PZT thickness of 0.6 \u03bcm and an IDE consisting of 12 finger pairs. This energy is reduced to 1.5 fJ for 5 \u03bcm PZT thickness with 2 electrode finger pairs, which shows that device geometry has a significant impact on device performance. The proposed method presents an accurate framework for the rapid design and performance prediction of novel piezoelectric energy harvester structures.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6604529/06604548.pdf","startPage":"2162","endPage":"2174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interdigitated-electrode-based mems-scale piezoelectric energy harvester modeling and optimization using finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6604548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6604548/","displayDocTitle":"Interdigitated-electrode-based mems-scale piezoelectric energy harvester modeling and optimization using finite element method","volume":"60","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795040","pubMedId":"24081265","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6604548/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interdigitated-electrode-based mems-scale piezoelectric energy harvester modeling and optimization using finite element method","sourcePdf":"t13a2162.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106932S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6604529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6604529","articleId":"6604548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6605493,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Zysset","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\u00a0in Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Zysset","id":"37591030300"},{"name":"Niko M\u00fcnzenrieder","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\u00a0in Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Niko","lastName":"M\u00fcnzenrieder","id":"38016017200"},{"name":"Luisa Petti","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\u00a0in Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luisa","lastName":"Petti","id":"38504396700"},{"name":"Lars B\u00fcthe","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\u00a0in Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"B\u00fcthe","id":"37077074800"},{"name":"Giovanni A.

Very good correlation is obtained between electrical parameters of the TSVs extracted from the measurements and electromagnetic field simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2013.2279688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/6750754/06605494.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2013.2279688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical, Numerical-, and Measurement\u2013Based Methods for Extracting the Electrical Parameters of Through Silicon Vias (TSVs)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605494/","displayDocTitle":"Analytical, Numerical-, and Measurement\u2013Based Methods for Extracting the Electrical Parameters of Through Silicon Vias (TSVs)","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14131389","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605494/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical, Numerical-, and Measurement\u2013Based Methods for Extracting the Electrical Parameters of Through Silicon Vias (TSVs)","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-ndip-2279688-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105324S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6750754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6750754","articleId":"6605494","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6605496,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37309347600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6605496","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":861},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"The antenna-channel effects on multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) throughput are characterized in terms of spatial multiplexing (SM) efficiency. In order to show the antenna effects explicitly, the SM efficiency of an MIMO system (with imperfect transmit antennas) is derived analytically at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. It is shown that correlation and power imbalance affect the throughput adversely (as expected) and independently. Although derived for imperfect transmit antennas, the close-form SM efficiency formula turns out to be accurate for 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO systems with imperfect receive antennas as well. It is also shown that the derived SM efficiency formula even reasonably predicts the measured SM efficiency of a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6478802/06605496.pdf","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2013.2282952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2013.2282952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6478802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Multiplexing Efficiency for MIMO Antenna Characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Correlation","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","space division multiplexing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput multiplexing efficiency","MIMO antenna characterization","antenna-channel effects","multiple-input multiple-output throughput","MIMO throughput","spatial multiplexing efficiency","signal-to-noise ratio regime","SNR regime","SM efficiency","receiving antennas","long term evolution system","LTE system","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antennas","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","spatial multiplexing (SM)","throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Multiplexing Efficiency for MIMO Antenna Characterization","volume":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6605496/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2013","accessionNumber":"13796362","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Multiplexing Efficiency for MIMO Antenna Characterization","sourcePdf":"lawp-chen-2282952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152259S","chronDate":"2013","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6478802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6478802","articleId":"6605496","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6605497,"authors":[{"name":"Khalida Ghanem","affiliation":["Centre De D\u00e9veloppement Des Technologies Avanc\u00e9es, Algeria"],"firstName":"Khalida","lastName":"Ghanem","id":"37269831600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6605497","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":602},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605497","abstract":"The channel capacity in body channels is of great importance since it determines the amount and type of data that can be transmitted using the body as a media for communication.

Different types of antennas are studied, namely PIFA, inverted IFA and monopole antennas, and the capacity in these channels is compared to on-body case. The impingement of the spatial correlation due to the presence of a high line of sight (LOS) component, on the average capacity is also studied.

(ICOs) that will have sensing, actuating, and data processing capabilities. Each ICO will have one or more embedded sensors that will capture potentially enormous amounts of data. The sensors and related data streams can be clustered physically or virtually, which raises the challenge of searching and selecting the right sensors for a query in an efficient and effective way. This paper proposes a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model, called CASSARAM, to address the challenge of efficiently selecting a subset of relevant sensors out of a large set of sensors with similar functionality and capabilities. CASSARAM considers user preferences and a broad range of sensor characteristics such as reliability, accuracy, location, battery life, and many more. This paper highlights the importance of sensor search, selection and ranking for the IoT, identifies important characteristics of both sensors and data capture processes, and discusses how semantic and quantitative reasoning can be combined together. This paper also addresses challenges such as efficient distributed sensor search and relational-expression based filtering. CASSARAM testing and performance evaluation results are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2282292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6675772/06605518.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2282292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor Search Techniques for Sensing as a Service Architecture for the Internet of Things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605518/","displayDocTitle":"Sensor Search Techniques for Sensing as a Service Architecture for the Internet of Things","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13934363","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor Search Techniques for Sensing as a Service Architecture for the Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jsen-perera-2282292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074263S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","isNumber":"6675772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"122","articleId":"6605518","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6605522,"authors":[{"name":"Seungku Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37675524800"},{"name":"Doo-Seop Eom","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Doo-Seop","lastName":"Eom","id":"37424612900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2194"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2208"}],"articleNumber":"6605522","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1095},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605522","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Power control","Reliability","Estimation","Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","power transmission control","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["link-state-estimation-based transmission power control","wireless body area networks","sensor node lifetime","link reliability","link states","received signal strength indicator","RSSI","practical transmission power control protocol","link-state estimations","transceiver","transmission power level","energy efficiency","body posture change","dynamic body motion","WBAN transmission power control protocols","real-time reactive scheme","dynamic postural position inference mechanism","sensor nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Healthcare","link-state estimation","transmission power control","wireless body area network (WBAN)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Computer Communication Networks","Female","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Movement","Posture","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Telemetry","Wireless Technology"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel transmission power control protocol to extend the lifetime of sensor nodes and to increase the link reliability in wireless body area networks (WBANs).

Both the short- and long-term link-state estimations enable the transceiver to adapt the transmission power level and target the RSSI threshold range, respectively, to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of energy efficiency and link reliability. Finally, the performance of the proposed protocol is experimentally evaluated in two experimental scenarios-body posture change and dynamic body motion-and compared with the typical WBAN transmission power control protocols, a real-time reactive scheme, and a dynamic postural position inference mechanism. From the experimental results, it is found that the proposed protocol increases the lifetime of the sensor nodes by a maximum of 9.86% and enhances the link reliability by reducing the packet loss by a maximum of 3.02%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6846381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2013.2282864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/6846381/06605522.pdf","startPage":"1294","endPage":"1302","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2013.2282864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link-State-Estimation-Based Transmission Power Control in Wireless Body Area Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Link-State-Estimation-Based Transmission Power Control in Wireless Body Area Networks","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6605522/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14429373","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2014","pubMedId":"24107988","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link-State-Estimation-Based Transmission Power Control in Wireless Body Area Networks","sourcePdf":"jbhi-eom-2282864-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057989S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6846381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6846381","articleId":"6605522","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6605525,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 M.

However, problems may arise in highly PV-integrated distribution systems. For example, a sudden stoppage of all PV systems due to anti-islanding protection may contribute to grid disturbances. Thus, standards featuring with ancillary services for the next-generation PV systems are under a revision in some countries. The future PV systems have to provide a full range of services as what the conventional power plants do, e.g., low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) under grid faults and grid support service. In order to map future challenges, the LVRT capability of three mainstream single-phase transformerless PV inverters under grid faults is explored in this paper. Control strategies with reactive power injection are also discussed. The selected inverters are the full-bridge (FB) inverter with bipolar modulation, the FB inverter with dc bypass, and the Highly Efficient and Reliable Inverter Concept (HERIC). A 1-kW single-phase grid-connected PV system is analyzed to verify the discussions. The tests confirmed that, although the HERIC inverter is the best candidate in terms of efficiency, it is not very particularly feasible in case of a voltage sag. The other two topologies are capable of providing reactive current during LVRT. A benchmarking of those inverters is also provided in this paper, which offers the possibility to select appropriate devices and to further optimize the transformerless system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/6816009/06605536.pdf","startPage":"1942","endPage":"1952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2013.2282966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2013.2282966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816009","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Voltage Ride-Through of Single-Phase Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Reactive power","Power system stability","Modulation","Voltage control","Topology","Voltage fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","photovoltaic power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-voltage ride-through","single-phase transformerless photovoltaic inverters","PV inverters","LVRT","grid faults","grid support service","reactive power injection","full-bridge inverter","FB inverter","bipolar modulation","highly efficient and reliable inverter concept","HERIC inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low voltage ride-through","grid support","single-phase systems","photovoltaic (PV)","transformerless inverters","reactive power injection","efficiency","leakage current elimination"]},{"kwd":["Efficiency","grid support","leakage current elimination","low-voltage ride-through (LVRT)","photovoltaic (PV)","reactive power injection","single-phase systems","transformerless inverters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Low-Voltage Ride-Through of Single-Phase Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters","volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6605536/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2014","accessionNumber":"14301863","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Voltage Ride-Through of Single-Phase Transformerless Photovoltaic Inverters","sourcePdf":"tia-yang-2282966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097026S","chronDate":"May-June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6816009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"6816009","articleId":"6605536","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6605544,"authors":[{"name":"Joel A.

We postulate that a leading cause of inconsistency is the gain of spurious information along unobservable directions, which results in smaller uncertainties, larger estimation errors, and divergence. We develop an observability constrained VINS (OC-VINS), which explicitly enforces the unobservable directions of the system, hence preventing spurious information gain and reducing inconsistency. This framework is applicable to several variants of the VINS problem such as visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM), as well as visual-inertial odometry using the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSC-KF). Our analysis, along with the proposed method to reduce inconsistency, are extensively validated with simulation trials and real-world experimentation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/6730969/06605544.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"176","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2013.2277549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2013.2277549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6730969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistency Analysis and Improvement of Vision-aided Inertial Navigation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Observability","Vectors","Analytical models","Cameras","Robot sensing systems","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance measurement","estimation theory","inertial navigation","Kalman filters","observability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consistency analysis","estimator inconsistency","vision-aided inertial navigation systems","VINS","system observability","unobservable directions","estimation errors","spurious information gain","visual simultaneous localization","mapping","V-SLAM","visual-inertial odometry","multistate constraint Kalman filter","MSC-KF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consistency","nonlinear estimation","observability analysis","vision-aided inertial navigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Consistency Analysis and Improvement of Vision-aided Inertial Navigation","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6605544/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14078371","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistency Analysis and Improvement of Vision-aided Inertial Navigation","sourcePdf":"tro-hesch-2277549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117944S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6730969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6730969","articleId":"6605544","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6605559,"authors":[{"name":"Amal A.

A general lung nodule shape model is proposed using implicit spaces as a signed distance function. The shape model is fused with the image intensity statistical information in a variational segmentation framework. The nodule shape model is mapped to the image domain by a global transformation that includes inhomogeneous scales, rotation, and translation parameters. A matching criteria between the shape model and the image implicit representations is employed to handle the alignment process. Transformation parameters evolve through gradient descent optimization to handle the shape alignment process and hence mark the boundaries of the nodule \u201chead.\u201d The embedding process takes into consideration the image intensity as well as prior shape information. A nonparametric density estimation approach is employed to handle the statistical intensity representation of the nodule and background regions. The proposed technique does not depend on nodule type or location. Exhaustive experimental and validation results are demonstrated on 742 nodules obtained from four different CT lung databases, illustrating the robustness of the approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13837709","pubMedId":"24107934","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6605559/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach for Lung Nodules Segmentation in Chest CT Using Level Sets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach for Lung Nodules Segmentation in Chest CT Using Level Sets","sourcePdf":"tip-farag-2282899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101004S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6609090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6609090","articleId":"6605559","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6605562,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Yu","affiliation":["Radio Communication \u2013ZFZ/WA4, Bell Labs Germany, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6671940/6605562/6605562-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Yu was born in Shanghai, China, in 1978.

The integrative nature of the sensor produces a blurred image of the observed moving feature, e.g., of a laser beam deflected on a steering mirror, when the image moves much faster than the exposure period. The key concept of this paper is to extract the parameters describing the motion of the observed feature from the image blur by treating the image sensor as a nonlinear temporal-to-spatial transformation, under a known input excitation, i.e., a sinusoid. The output signal amplitude and phase characterize the frequency response of the system at the specific excitation frequency. This problem is posed as a nonlinear minimization: finding parameters to match the predicted spatial distribution with the measurement. The nonlinear mapping is shown to be noninvertible; therefore, the solution of the nonlinear minimization is nonunique. Two methods are proposed for avoiding this aliasing problem: 1) by imposing a continuity constraint and 2) by solving the minimization over two different exposure periods. The efficacy of the proposed frequency response identification approach for a multi-input/multioutput system is experimentally demonstrated by accurately obtaining the frequency response of a fast steering mirror up to 500 Hz using a 30-Hz CCD camera.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2013.2280819","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/6807529/06605587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2013.2280819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6807529","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of Fast-Rate Systems Using Slow-Rate Image Sensor Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identification of Fast-Rate Systems Using Slow-Rate Image Sensor Measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14266898","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6605587/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Fast-Rate Systems Using Slow-Rate Image Sensor Measurements","sourcePdf":"tmech-tani-2280819-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08718S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6807529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6807529","articleId":"6605587","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6605593,"authors":[{"name":"Sivaraman Dasarathan","affiliation":["Arizona State University, School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6648447/6605593/6605593-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sivaraman Dasarathan received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronics engineering in 2000 from the University of Madras, Chennai, India, and the M.E. degree in electronics engineering in 2003 from Anna University, Chennai, India.

The basis of the system is a single-carrier (SC) scheme with recursive equalization on the receiver side. In this paper, we will give a motivation for our choice of SC by discussing some aspects of modulation and coding for UW communication systems from an information-theoretic point of view. The system is able to take advantage of the diversity offered by the multipath and/or by multiple receivers. Due to the great variations in the UW channel, reliable prediction of communication performance in terms of achievable range and data rate is nontrivial. This has motivated the development of a simulation tool called COMLAB, based on combining the communication system with hybrid ray-trace plane-wave time-domain modeling of sound propagation. The simulation tool is designed to account for environmental effects with significant influence on communication performance, including surface and bottom reflections, transmission loss, ambient noise, and ray-path-dependent Doppler shifts caused by moving source, receivers, or surface waves. Short descriptions of the communication system and the simulation tool are given. A comparison of the predicted performance with experiments made at the UAN'11 trials in the Trondheim fjord (Norway) is presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Ray tracing","Multipath channels","Acoustic propagation","Underwater communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic receivers","Doppler shift","time-domain analysis","turbo codes","underwater acoustic communication","underwater acoustic propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Swedish Defence Research Agency","single-carrier turbo-coded system","FOI","Stockholm","Sweden","underwater acoustic communication","point-to-point network application","P2P network","single-carrier scheme","recursive equalization","receiver","SC scheme","UW channel","COMLAB","hybrid ray-trace plane-wave time-domain modeling","sound propagation","surface reflection","bottom reflection","transmission loss","ray-path-dependent Doppler shift","UAN'11 trial","Trondheim fjord","Norway"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic propagation","multipath","ray tracing","spatial diversity","time domain","turbo equalizers single carrier","underwater communication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JOE.2013.2278892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/6616299/06605598.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6616299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2013.2278892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Single-Carrier Turbo-Coded System for Underwater Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Single-Carrier Turbo-Coded System for Underwater Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605598/","volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605598/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13811174","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Single-Carrier Turbo-Coded System for Underwater Communications","sourcePdf":"joe-oberg-2278892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103812S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6616299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6616299","articleId":"6605598","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6605599,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pascal","affiliation":["Sup\u00e9lec/SONDRA, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6648447/6605599/6605599-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pascal was born in Sallanches, France in 1979.

Considering the estimation issue of the MGGD parameters, the main contribution of this paper is to prove that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the scatter matrix exists and is unique up to a scalar factor, for a given shape parameter \u03b2 \u2208 (0,1). Moreover, an estimation algorithm based on a Newton-Raphson recursion is proposed for computing the MLE of MGGD parameters. Various experiments conducted on synthetic and real data are presented to illustrate the theoretical derivations in terms of number of iterations and number of samples for different values of the shape parameter. The main conclusion of this work is that the parameters of MGGDs can be estimated using the maximum likelihood principle with good performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13875255","htmlLink":"/document/6605599/","displayDocTitle":"Parameter Estimation For Multivariate Generalized Gaussian Distributions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter Estimation For Multivariate Generalized Gaussian Distributions","sourcePdf":"tsp-bombrun-2282909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105263S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6648447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6648447","articleId":"6605599","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6605602,"authors":[{"name":"Tz-yi Liu","affiliation":["SanDisk Corporation, Milpitas, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6690141/6605602/6605602-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tz-yi Liu (M'92) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1994, and the M.S. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 1998, both in electrical engineering.","From 1998 to 2002, he was with Micron Technology, Inc., where he worked on memory core, data path, analog circuit, and DC\u2013DC converter for system power reduction.

The memory array is constructed with cross-point architecture to allow multiple memory layers stacked above the supporting circuitry and minimize the circuit area overhead. Die efficiency is further improved by sharing wordlines and bitlines between adjacent blocks. As the number of sense amplifiers under the memory array is limited, a pipelined array control scheme is adopted to compensate the performance impact while utilizing the fast switching time of ReRAM cells. With the chip current consumption being dominated by the array leakage and sensitive to array bias and operating conditions, a charge pump stage control scheme is introduced to dynamically adapt to the operating conditions for optimal power consumption. Smart Read during sensing and leakage current compensation scheme during programming are applied to the large-block architecture and achieve a chip density that is several orders of magnitude higher than prior ReRAM developments.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2013.2280296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6690141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2280296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6690141/06605602.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 130.7-- 2-Layer 32-Gb ReRAM Memory Device in 24-nm Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A 130.7-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{mm}^{2}$</tex> </formula> 2-Layer 32-Gb ReRAM Memory Device in 24-nm Technology","volume":"49","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605602/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13990173","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605602/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 130.7-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{mm}^{2}$</tex> </formula> 2-Layer 32-Gb ReRAM Memory Device in 24-nm Technology","sourcePdf":"jssc-liu-2280296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158265S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6690141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6690141","articleId":"6605602","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6605604,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Nallathambi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6714426/6605604/6605604-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gabriel Nallathambi (S\u201913) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Anna University, Tamil Nadu, India, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering under the guidance of Dr. J.

Continuous, portable 24/7 ECG monitoring requires wireless technology with constraints on power, bandwidth, area, and resolution. In order to provide continuous remote monitoring of patients and fast transmission of data to medical personnel for instantaneous intervention, we propose a methodology that converts analog inputs into pulses for ultralow power implementation. The signal encoding scheme is the time-based integrate and fire (IF) sampler from which a set of signal descriptors in the pulse domain are proposed. Furthermore, a logical decision rule for QRS detection based on morphological checking is derived. The proposed decision logic depends exclusively on relational and logical operators resulting in ultrafast recognition and can be implemented using combinatorial logic hardware to guarantee power consumption orders of magnitude lower than any microprocessor device. The algorithm was evaluated using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and results show that our algorithm performance is comparable to the state-of-the art software-based detection.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2282954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical

In inverted, staggered TFTs, the primary gate is usually the bottom gate (BG) and the TFT's threshold voltage (VTH) can be adjusted by applying a constant bias to the secondary gate, the top gate (TG), while scanning the BG. Dual-gate TFTs are being used as the load TFT in oxide semiconductor-based inverters, where the TG is biased positively to shift the VTH negatively and, thereby improving the inverter's output swing. Here, we show that the same can be achieved by the use of a floating TG.

At low bit rates, such encoding may produce attention-grabbing coding artifacts, which may draw viewer's attention away from ROI, thereby degrading visual quality. In this paper, we present a saliency-aware video compression method for ROI-based video coding. The proposed method aims at reducing salient coding artifacts in non-ROI parts of the frame in order to keep user's attention on ROI. Further, the method allows saliency to increase in high quality parts of the frame, and allows saliency to reduce in non-ROI parts. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is able to improve visual quality of encoded video relative to conventional rate distortion optimized video coding, as well as two state-of-the art perceptual video coding methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2282897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6657713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2282897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6657713/06605606.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency-Aware Video Compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Saliency-Aware Video Compression","volume":"23","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605606/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13884341","pubMedId":"24107933","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605606/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency-Aware Video Compression","sourcePdf":"tip-hadizadeh-2282897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153085S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6657713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"6657713","articleId":"6605606","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6605609,"authors":[{"name":"Junzhi Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6740874/6605609/6605609-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junzhi Yu received the B.E. degree in safety engineering and the M.E. degree in precision instruments and mechanology from the North China Institute of Technology, Taiyuan, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2003.","He is currently a Professor of the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing.

Functioning as a biological neural network, CPGs can be considered as a group of coupled neurons that generate rhythmic signals without sensory feedback; however, sensory feedback is needed to shape the CPG signals. The basic idea in engineering endeavors is to replicate this intrinsic, computationally efficient, distributed control mechanism for multiple articulated joints, or multi-DOF control cases. In terms of various abstraction levels, existing CPG control models and their extensions are reviewed with a focus on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the models, including ease of design and implementation. The main issues arising from design, optimization, and implementation of the CPG-based control as well as possible alternatives are further discussed, with an attempt to shed more light on locomotion control-oriented theories and applications. The design challenges and trends associated with the further advancement of this area are also summarized.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280596","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6740874/06605609.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2280596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on CPG-Inspired Control Models and System Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on CPG-Inspired Control Models and System Implementation","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14111771","pubMedId":"24807442","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6605609/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61075102, 61375102 and 61333016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4122084"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on CPG-Inspired Control Models and System Implementation","sourcePdf":"tnnls-yu-2280596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19929S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6740874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"6740874","articleId":"6605609","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6605610,"authors":[{"name":"Yuejie Chi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6648447/6605610/6605610-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuejie Chi (S'09\u2013M'12) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University in 2012, and the B.E.

Examples include images, videos and internet traffic data. It is of great significance to estimate and track the low-dimensional structure with small storage requirements and computational complexity when the data dimension is high. Therefore we consider the problem of reconstructing a data stream from a small subset of its entries, where the data is assumed to lie in a low-dimensional linear subspace, possibly corrupted by noise. We further consider tracking the change of the underlying subspace, which can be applied to applications such as video denoising, network monitoring and anomaly detection. Our setting can be viewed as a sequential low-rank matrix completion problem in which the subspace is learned in an online fashion. The proposed algorithm, dubbed Parallel Estimation and Tracking by REcursive Least Squares (PETRELS), first identifies the underlying low-dimensional subspace, and then reconstructs the missing entries via least-squares estimation if required. Subspace identification is performed via a recursive procedure for each row of the subspace matrix in parallel with discounting for previous observations. Numerical examples are provided for direction-of-arrival estimation and matrix completion, comparing PETRELS with state of the art batch algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2282910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6648447/06605610.pdf","startPage":"5947","endPage":"5959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2282910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PETRELS: Parallel Subspace Estimation and Tracking by Recursive Least Squares From Partial Observations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"PETRELS: Parallel Subspace Estimation and Tracking by Recursive Least Squares From Partial Observations","volume":"61","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13875256","htmlLink":"/document/6605610/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PETRELS: Parallel Subspace Estimation and Tracking by Recursive Least Squares From Partial Observations","sourcePdf":"tsp-chi-2282910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106204S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6648447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6648447","articleId":"6605610","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6605611,"authors":[{"name":"Fumihiko Tachibana","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6690141/6605611/6605611-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fumihiko Tachibana (M'08) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electronics engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.","In 2005, he joined the Center for Semiconductor Research and Development, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan.

Let the wave field, which is observed by a sensor array, be caused by a spatially-sparse set of sources. A spatially weighted Laplace-like prior is assumed for the source field and the corresponding weighted Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) cost function is derived. After the weighted LASSO solution has been calculated as the maximum a posteriori estimate at time step k, the posterior distribution of the source amplitudes is analytically approximated. The weighting of the Laplace-like prior for time step k+1 is then fitted to the approximated posterior distribution. This results in a sequential update for the LASSO weights. Thus, a sequence of weighted LASSO problems is solved for estimating the temporal evolution of a sparse source field. The method is evaluated numerically using a uniform linear array in simulations and applied to data which were acquired from a towed horizontal array during the long range acoustic communications experiment.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2282919","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6657827/06605624.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6657827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2282919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6344","endPage":"6354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Bayesian Sparse Signal Reconstruction Using Array Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Bayesian Sparse Signal Reconstruction Using Array Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605624/","volume":"61","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/6605624/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13888690","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Bayesian Sparse Signal Reconstruction Using Array Data","sourcePdf":"tsp-mecklenbrauker-2282919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112295S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6657827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6657827","articleId":"6605624","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6605625,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal Rich\u00e9","affiliation":["SAPHIR Team, Fraunhoffer Institut, Wachtberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6750067/6605625/6605625-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vishal Rich\u00e9 received the M.S. degree in signal and circuit from the Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France, in 2009.

The output voltage regulation is normally achieved by an outer voltage feedback loop and a sinusoidal pulse-width-modulated (SPWM) inner current loop. However, the non-ideal power grid may drive the converter to enter a low-frequency instability region. In this paper, a low-frequency instability phenomenon in three-phase PFC power supplies is reported. The converter can also be regarded as exhibiting a Hopf-type bifurcation in which the dc output voltage oscillates at 150 Hz, and a large amount of harmonics appear on the line current. We develop an averaged model of the grid-converter system to predict the low-frequency instability. The effects of circuit and grid parameters can be studied with this model. Additionally, as a result of the emergence of low-frequency oscillation, the stability boundary leading to a catastrophic bifurcation changes dramatically. Simulation results also provide design-oriented boundaries of operation. This phenomenon is confirmed by experimental measurement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","volume":"60","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"13918219","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605630/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Frequency Hopf Bifurcation and Its Effects on Stability Margin in Three-Phase PFC Power Supplies Connected to Non-Ideal Power Grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Frequency Hopf Bifurcation and Its Effects on Stability Margin in Three-Phase PFC Power Supplies Connected to Non-Ideal Power Grid","sourcePdf":"tcsi-tse-2264698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079799S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6671940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6671940","articleId":"6605630","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6605634,"authors":[{"name":"Pietro DeLellis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6646285/6605634/6605634-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pietro De Lellis was born in Naples, Italy, in 1983.

The filters under consideration are of high order and wide coefficient wordlength. Both the single-stage and cascade form are considered. In a practical filter design problem, when the filter specification is stringent, requiring high filter order and wide coefficient wordlength, GAs often fail to find feasible solutions, because the discrete search space thus constructed is huge and the majority of the solution candidates therein can not meet the specification. In the proposed GA, the discrete search space is partitioned into smaller ones. Each small space is constructed surrounding a base discrete coefficient set which is obtained by a proposed greedy algorithm. The partition of the search space increases the chances for the GA to find feasible solutions, but does not sacrifice the coverage of the search. The proposed GA applies to the design of single-stage filters. When a cascade form filter is designed, for each single-stage filter meeting the filter specification generated during the course of GA, an integer polynomial factorization is applied. Design examples show that the proposed GA significantly outperforms existing algorithms dealing with the similar problems in terms of design time, and the hardware cost is saved in most cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13875275","volume":"60","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6605635/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Single-Stage and Cascade Design of High Order Multiplierless Linear Phase FIR Filters Using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Stage and Cascade Design of High Order Multiplierless Linear Phase FIR Filters Using Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ye-2256211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102695S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6646285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6646285","articleId":"6605635","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6605636,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Zbigniew Wieczorek","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6704325/6605636/6605636-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Piotr Zbigniew Wieczorek (M'12) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, both from the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Pokand, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","He has been a member of the Analogue Electronic Circuits and Electronic Systems research group, which is under the leadership of Prof. L.

Most metastability-based solutions operate on the uncertainty of a logical output state of a device (flip-flop, D-latch) aimed to be resolved from an exact metastable point. However, it has been shown that the metastable point of a bistable circuit (which is practically impossible to reach) does not guarantee absolute randomness or sufficient entropy. We propose the concept of a device in which the direct proximity of the metastable point is not mandatory. In our concept the transition times of two devices are compared. Such construction is less sensitive to the proximity of the metastable point, temperature fluctuations, and power supply instabilities. The paper briefly describes the metastability phenomena in general and other known metastability-based TRNG concepts. A new concept of a dual-metastability time-competitive generator is presented, analyzed both numerically and theoretically, and verified based on the sample circuit's implementation. Empirical and statistical test results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2265952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6704325/06605636.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2265952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Metastability Time-Competitive True Random Number Generator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Metastability Time-Competitive True Random Number Generator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605636/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13998706","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605636/","volume":"61","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Metastability Time-Competitive True Random Number Generator","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wieczorek-2265952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096423S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6704325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6704325","articleId":"6605636","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6605638,"authors":[{"name":"Paul A. van Walree","affiliation":["Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/6616299/6605638/6605638-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul A. van Walree (M'08) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in solid-state physics from Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands, in 1992 and 1997, respectively.","From 1998 to 2009, he was an Underwater Acoustician at The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), The Hague, The Netherlands.

However, due to mutual interference between the PN sequence and the OFDM data block, TDS-OFDM cannot support high-order modulation schemes such as 256QAM in realistic static channels with large delay spread or high-definition television (HDTV) delivery in fast fading channels. To solve these problems, we propose the idea of using multiple inter-block-interference (IBI)-free regions of small size to realize simultaneous multi-channel reconstruction under the framework of structured compressive sensing (SCS). This is enabled by jointly exploiting the sparsity of wireless channels as well as the characteristic that path delays vary much slower than path gains. In this way, the mutually conditional time-domain channel estimation and frequency-domain data demodulation in TDS-OFDM can be decoupled without the use of iterative interference removal. The Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed estimation scheme is also derived. Moreover, the guard interval amplitude in TDS-OFDM can be reduced to improve the energy efficiency, which is infeasible for CP-OFDM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCS-aided TDS-OFDM scheme has a higher spectrum and energy efficiency than CP-OFDM by more than 10% and 20% respectively in typical applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum- and Energy-Efficient OFDM Based on Simultaneous Multi-Channel Reconstruction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2282920","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6648447/06605639.pdf","startPage":"6047","endPage":"6059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2282920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum- and Energy-Efficient OFDM Based on Simultaneous Multi-Channel Reconstruction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/6605639/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2013","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13875265","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum- and Energy-Efficient OFDM Based on Simultaneous Multi-Channel Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tsp-dai-2282920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162116S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6648447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6648447","articleId":"6605639","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6605643,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6835146/6605643/chen-2279652-small.gif","p":["Wenjie Chen (S'12\u2013M'12) received the B.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, all in Mechanical Engineering.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Scholar with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of California, Berkeley.

Existing research in execution of scientific workflows in Clouds either try to minimize the workflow execution time ignoring deadlines and budgets or focus on the minimization of cost while trying to meet the application deadline. However, they implement limited contingency strategies to correct delays caused by underestimation of tasks execution time or fluctuations in the delivered performance of leased public Cloud resources. To mitigate effects of performance variation of resources on soft deadlines of workflow applications, we propose an algorithm that uses idle time of provisioned resources and budget surplus to replicate tasks. Simulation experiments with four well-known scientific workflows show that the proposed algorithm increases the likelihood of deadlines being met and reduces the total execution time of applications as the budget available for replication increases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meeting Deadlines of Scientific Workflows in Public Clouds with Tasks Replication","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.238","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6828815/06605687.pdf","startPage":"1787","endPage":"1796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6828815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Meeting Deadlines of Scientific Workflows in Public Clouds with Tasks Replication","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6605687/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14396643","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meeting Deadlines of Scientific Workflows in Public Clouds with Tasks Replication","sourcePdf":"tpds-calheiros-238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065789S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6828815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"6828815","articleId":"6605687","onlineDate":"20 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6605770,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyao Sha","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Wenyao","lastName":"Sha","id":"37074704900"},{"name":"Yongxin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37310652700"},{"name":"Tian Huang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Huang","id":"38003563800"},{"name":"Meikang Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kentucky, USA"],"firstName":"Meikang","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37288778000"},{"name":"Yan Zhu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37074792500"},{"name":"Qiannan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Qiannan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38467556400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2159-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6605770","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Training","Time series analysis","Data models","Servers","Intrusion detection","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","security of data","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiorder Markov chain","anomaly detection","server systems","high-order Markov chain","multivariate time series","training algorithms","testing algorithms","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set","system calls","return values","two-dimensional input set","anomalies indicator","absolute values","single-order model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Markov chain","Kth-order Markov chain","multivariate time series","anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a feasible multi-order Markov chain based scheme for anomaly detection in server systems.

The calculation result shows that this approach is able to produce several effective indicators of anomalies. In addition to the absolute values given by an individual single-order model, we also notice a novelty unprecedented before, i.e., the changes in ranking positions of outputs from different-order ones also correlate closely with abnormal behaviours. Moreover, the analysis and application proves our approach's efficiency in consuming reasonable cost of time and storage.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.12","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6605718/6605724/06605770.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-order Markov Chain Based Scheme for Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605770/","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-order Markov Chain Based Scheme for Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13848171","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605770/","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-order Markov Chain Based Scheme for Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Japan","sourcePdf":"4987a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054793S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6605718","isNumber":"6605724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6605718","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6605724","articleId":"6605770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6605790,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Huang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Huang","id":"38003563800"},{"name":"Yan Zhu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37074792500"},{"name":"Qiannan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qiannan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38467556400"},{"name":"Yongxin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37310652700"},{"name":"Dongyang Wang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dongyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37061644600"},{"name":"Meikang Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kentucky, USA"],"firstName":"Meikang","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37288778000"},{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["China Unionpay Corporate, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37074457300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2159-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6605790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LOF-Based Adaptive Anomaly Detection Scheme for Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6605718/6605724/06605790.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605724","doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.28","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge based systems","Cloud computing","Testing","Business","Training","Web servers","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","commerce","information technology","outsourcing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LOF-based adaptive anomaly detection scheme","cloud computing","outsourcing","IT","business applications","social outbreaks","local outlier factor","network intrusion detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","Cloud Computing","LOF","adaptive","contextual anomaly"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605790","abstract":"One of the most attractive things about cloud computing from the perspective of business people is that it provides an effective means to outsource IT. The behaviors of business applications on cloud are constantly evolving due to technical upgrading, cloud migration as well as social outbreaks. These changes bring the challenge of detecting anomalies during the change of applications on cloud. LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm has already been proven as the most promising outlier detection method for detecting network intrusions. To improve the performance of detection, LOF needs a complete set of normal behaviors of business applications, which is usually not available in cloud computing. We present an adaptive anomaly detection scheme for cloud computing based on LOF. Our scheme learns behaviors of applications both in training and detecting phase. It is adaptive to the change during detecting. The adaptability of our scheme reduces demand of efforts on collecting training data before detecting. It also enables the ability to detect contextual anomalies. Experimental results show that our scheme can effectively detect contextual anomalies with relatively low computational overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13848186","htmlLink":"/document/6605790/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An LOF-Based Adaptive Anomaly Detection Scheme for Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LOF-Based Adaptive Anomaly Detection Scheme for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Japan","sourcePdf":"4987a206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075404S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6605718","isNumber":"6605724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6605718","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6605724","articleId":"6605790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6605813,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitri Perrin","affiliation":["Dublin City University, Dublin, IE"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Perrin","id":"37675988300"},{"name":"Christophe Duhamel","affiliation":["LIMOS, CNRS UMR 6158, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Duhamel","id":"37671435100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2159-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6605813","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605813","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Sociology","Statistics","Encoding","Data analysis","Lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","genetic algorithms","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-life data analysis problems","dataset size","parallel methods","computational power","parallelisation","genetic algorithms","parallel implementation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.50","pdfPath":"/iel7/6605718/6605724/06605813.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","startPage":"339","endPage":"344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency of Parallelisation of Genetic Algorithms in the Data Analysis Context","abstract":"Most real-life data analysis problems are difficult to solve using exact methods, due to the size of the datasets and the nature of the underlying mechanisms of the system under investigation.

One solution is to consider parallel methods, and to use the increased computational power to perform a deeper exploration of the solution space in a similar time. It is, however, difficult to estimate a priori whether parallelisation will provide the expected improvement.

Through the advantage of usage of resource visualization, parallel processing, access control, and data service integration with scalable virtual machines, cloud computing can not only reduces the cost and barrier for the automation and computerization to the individuals and enterprises, but also promise lower IT cost, efficient management, high capability for data and user accesses. The virtual machine management and reduction to the corresponding operation overhead, related to virtual machine deploying and clustering, has become the essential issue to the cloud computing comprehensively. And effective and efficient data service has become the key to the bottleneck problem, especially in the cloud environment intermixing with the nature of big data. In this paper, we propose an improvement to data Service in cloud computing with content sensitive transaction analysis and adaptation, which is named ADSC (Adaptive Data Service Coordinator). ADSC manages and monitors the query sequence consisting of data requirement transactions collected from clients/users to the data service virtual machines with big data. Through analyzing with a machine learning awareness algorithm using theory of Fuzzy ART, ADSC detects the similarity, redundancy, and localization of the data accesses, then improve the following transactions by reordering the query sequence or even the virtual machine service re-deployment. ADSC is proposed to benefit enterprise cloud application with more efficient big data and Big Table operation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improvement to Data Service in Cloud Computing with Content Sensitive Transaction Analysis and Adaptation","doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.72","startPage":"463","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605724","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6605718/6605724/06605834.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Improvement to Data Service in Cloud Computing with Content Sensitive Transaction Analysis and Adaptation","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605834/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13848124","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improvement to Data Service in Cloud Computing with Content Sensitive Transaction Analysis and Adaptation","confLoc":"Japan","sourcePdf":"4987a463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052324S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6605718","isNumber":"6605724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6605718","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6605724","articleId":"6605834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6605885,"authors":[{"name":"Hitoshi Yabusaki","affiliation":["Yokohama Research Laboratory, Hitachi Limited, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hitoshi","lastName":"Yabusaki","id":"38234933300"},{"name":"Masakuni Agetsuma","affiliation":["Yokohama Research Laboratory, Hitachi Limited, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masakuni","lastName":"Agetsuma","id":"37060967200"},{"name":"Hiroshi Nakagoe","affiliation":["Yokohama Research Laboratory, Hitachi Limited, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Nakagoe","id":"37275842300"},{"name":"Koichi Murayama","affiliation":["Yokohama Research Laboratory, Hitachi Limited, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Murayama","id":"37074789100"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Osaki","affiliation":["Yokohama Research Laboratory, Hitachi Limited, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Osaki","id":"37074148600"},{"name":"Masami Hiramatsu","affiliation":["Yokohama Research Laboratory, Hitachi Limited, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masami","lastName":"Hiramatsu","id":"37073991900"},{"name":"Takatoshi Kato","affiliation":["Yokohama Research Laboratory, Hitachi Limited, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takatoshi","lastName":"Kato","id":"37075266200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2159-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6605885","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","IP networks","Throughput","Cloud computing","Sensors","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","computer network reliability","delays","distributed control","failure analysis","IP networks","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide area distributed cloud computing","microdata centers","DCs","wide area networks","microDC failure","flow control system","L4 headers","L3 headers","L2 headers","OpenFlow","received packets","M2M terminals","destination IP address","distributed control system","switching delay","packet-in mechanism","centralized control","\u03bcDCs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["flow control","wide area distributed cloud computing","distributed control","OpenFlow","micro DC","resiliency"]}],"abstract":"Wide area distributed cloud computing, where data are processed and stored at micro datacenters (DCs) located around terminals, improves response time and reduces the amount of traffic in wide area networks. However, it is difficult for the cloud to maintain service in the case of micro DC failure because the robustness of micro DCs is substantially lower than that of conventional DCs. We propose a flow control system that transfers the flow to other micro DCs by converting the L2, L3, and L4 headers of received packets via OpenFlow when micro DC failures occur. The proposed system enables flow to be transferred to other micro DCs even from M2M terminals such as sensors that are unable to change the destination IP address. We also developed a distributed control system to solve the critical problem of switching delay caused by the packet-in mechanism used when applying the OpenFlow to the distributed cloud. Emulation results showed that throughput in the distributed control became stable 12 times as quickly as that in the centralized control when flow was transferred.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.110","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6605718/6605724/06605885.pdf","startPage":"760","endPage":"764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flow Control for Higher Resiliency in Wide Area Distributed Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6605885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6605885/","displayDocTitle":"Flow Control for Higher Resiliency in Wide Area Distributed Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13848112","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6605885/","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flow Control for Higher Resiliency in Wide Area Distributed Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Japan","sourcePdf":"4987a760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055473S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6605718","isNumber":"6605724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6605718","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6605724","articleId":"6605885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6605934,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.

The performance of the passive and active suspension has also been compared. The results show that the active suspension system performs better than the passive suspension system.

However, most of the traditional communication technologies can not satisfy the critical and complex requirements of smart grid, such as, efficiency, reliability, resilience, sustainability, and security. In this paper, the cognitive radio (CR) technology is leveraged to construct the communication infrastructure of smart grid. First, ISM bands and leased bands are introduced as backup bands to ensure the QoS of data communications in CR based networks, for which a rule that decides when to stop spectrum sensing and access the ISM bands is also provided. Furthermore, a proper communication scheme is proposed for distributed generation system based on the fact that different renewable energy source has different active period during a day. Some licensed bands whose idle time is in line with the active period of renewable energy sources are set aside exclusively for distributed generation system access. The two schemes improve both the efficiency of spectrum utilization and reliability of cognitive communications in smart grid.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605987","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589047/6605987/06606084.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio networks for smart grid communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6606084/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio networks for smart grid communications","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13847917","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio networks for smart grid communications","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"097ASCC20130230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06762S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589047","isNumber":"6605987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589047","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6605987","articleId":"6606084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6606116,"authors":[{"name":"Quanbo Ge","affiliation":["School of Automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Quanbo","lastName":"Ge","id":"37278902700"},{"name":"Chenglin Wen","affiliation":["School of Automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chenglin","lastName":"Wen","id":"37292685500"},{"name":"Xiangfeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Nanjing Univertisy, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37074646400"},{"name":"Xingfa Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xingfa","lastName":"Shen","id":"37404354400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5769-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5767-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6606116","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606116","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Bayes methods","Kalman filters","Upper bound","Noise","Adaptive systems","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filters","Bayes methods","state estimation","stochastic systems","tracking filters","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filter","quantized strong tracking filter","integrated message noise","VB method","time-variant fading factor","STF technology","quantization error variance","quantized state estimator","stochastic quantization error vector","variational Bayesian method","sensor measurement quantization","adaptive bit quantization","networked state estimation","stochastic quantized measurements systems","linear state estimator","VB-AQKF-STF"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606116","publicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589047/6605987/06606116.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VB-AQKF-STF: A novel linear state estimator for stochastic quantized measurements systems","abstract":"Networked state estimation with adaptive bit quantization is studied for linear systems in this paper, for which sensor measurements are locally quantized and the taken quantized messages are sent to a processing center.

A kind of novel quantized state estimator VB-AQKF-STF is proposed to effectively improve quantized estimate accuracy and performance to deal with sudden change of state. The variance of the quantization error is approximated by a known upper bound, and the STF with a time-variant fading factor is used to reduce influence of the approximation and achieve strong tracking performance for the inaccurate system model. The VB method is applied to dynamically evaluate the variance of the integrated message noise. In nature, this variance estimate essentially provides a basis for the quantized strong tracking filter.

An iterative training radial basis function (RBF) neural network is developed to estimate the effect of initial state on terminal output and to learn the changes in initial state iteratively at the same time. By involving these information in the control scheme, the proposed NNTILC can drive the system to track run-varying reference point fast and precisely beyond the initial disturbance and reference change. Stability and convergence of this NNTILC method is proved and computer simulation results confirm its effectiveness further.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","discrete time systems","iterative methods","learning systems","linear systems","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","stability","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-varying reference point","neural network based terminal iterative learning control method","NNTILC method","discrete time linear run-to-run systems","state disturbance","iterative training radial basis function neural","RBF neural network","state estimation","terminal output","stability","convergence"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606134","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589047/6605987/06606134.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based terminal iterative learning control for tracking run-varying reference point","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network based terminal iterative learning control for tracking run-varying reference point","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13847668","publicationDate":"June 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6606134/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based terminal iterative learning control for tracking run-varying reference point","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"147ASCC20130309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062035S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589047","isNumber":"6605987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589047","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6605987","articleId":"6606134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6606145,"authors":[{"name":"Li Xia-Yu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xia-Yu","id":"37074246700"},{"name":"Jin Hui-Liang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Hui-Liang","id":"37074452200"},{"name":"Zhong Qing-Chang","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Qing-Chang","id":"37074555400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5769-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5767-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6606145","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606145","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Robust stability","Control systems","Uncertainty","Robustness","Educational institutions","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","feedback","linear systems","Lyapunov methods","numerical analysis","optimisation","robust control","sampled data systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general optimization method","F optimization design","numerical mathematical methods","mathematical process","robust stability radius","maximum uncertainty set radius","compensator","numerical algorithm","extend Lyapunov upper bound robust stability test","affine parameter-dependent model","linear time-invariant uncertain systems","multirate sampled-data control system optimization design","RSR","multirate sampled-data output feedback design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust stability","Multirate Sampled-data control system","Upper bound of Lyapunov function","Optimization","GSHF"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates Multirate sampled-data control system optimization design by considering robust stability of linear time-invariant uncertain systems described by affine parameter-dependent model.

In particular, it is shown that by applying classes of stochastic approximation methods to dynamical systems via periodic sampled-data control, convergence analysis can be performed using standard tools in stochastic approximation. A tuning parameter within this framework is the period of the synchronised sampler and hold device, which is also the waiting time during which the system dynamics settle to within a controllable neighbourhood of the steady-state input-output behaviour. Semiglobal convergence with probability one is demonstrated for three basic classes of stochastic approximation methods: finite-difference, random directions, and simultaneous perturbation. The tradeoff between the speed of convergence and accuracy is also discussed within the context of asymptotic normality of the outputs of these optimisation algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

area reconnaissance (CAR) is the primary task for multi-UAV. However, the current research results hardly balance the optimality and real-time property. Especially, how to avoid and process emergent threats is rarely considered for UAV formation. So this paper researched on the problems of CAR for multi-UAV in dynamic environment to obtain optimum efficiency on the premise of ensuring real-time. Firstly, the mathematical model and optimization framework were established. Then the idea of Model Predictive Control (MPC) was introduced to process this model and an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Simulated Annealing (SA) was proposed to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the termination condition of searching was defined and processing strategies in multiple emergent conditions were represented specially. Finally, analysis and comparison of the results from established simulation platform verified that the methods proposed in this paper could control the UAVs avoiding the static and mobile threats effectively, accomplishing task perfectly with more than 90% reconnaissance coverage rate and the run-time of each prediction step was only 1.3892s.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606210","publicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589047/6605987/06606210.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605987","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative area reconnaissance for multi-UAV in dynamic environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative area reconnaissance for multi-UAV in dynamic environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606210/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13847891","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6606210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative area reconnaissance for multi-UAV in dynamic environment","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"223ASCC20130437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061118S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589047","isNumber":"6605987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589047","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6605987","articleId":"6606210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6606219,"authors":[{"name":"Chiung-Chou Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology, Zhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiung-Chou","lastName":"Liao","id":"37363111900"},{"name":"Chiu-Hsiung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic System Research Division, Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiu-Hsiung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280749800"},{"name":"Ya-Fu Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology, Zhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ya-Fu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37279371900"},{"name":"Sung-Chi Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology, Zhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sung-Chi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37074142300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5769-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5767-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6606219","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backstepping","Neural networks","Robustness","Control systems","Lyapunov methods","Mechanical systems","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","approximation theory","asymptotic stability","compensation","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","shock absorbers","springs (mechanical)","vibration control","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","mass-spring-damper system","asymptotic stability","approximation error","Lyapunov stability theorem","adaptation laws","WNN","robust compensator","neural controller","mechanical system","wavelet neural network control approach","backstepping control approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive control","backstepping control","wavelet neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606219","abstract":"A combined backstepping and wavelet neural network control approach for mechanical system is proposed in this paper.

We try to investigate how to maximize the expected profit while ensuring the least electricity cost in the context of smart grids. To decrease the electricity cost, the base station is equipped with energy storage, such as uninterrupted power supply (UPS). Based on the time-varying power price, the UPS is charged and discharged at low and high power price, respectively. A pricing scheme is also proposed for the wireless operator to charge downlink user with security demand. The prominence of our proposed scheduling design is that it can be easily implemented without any statistic knowledge of electricity pricing. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve a near-optimal performance and that its effectiveness and robustness is also validated through simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606231","publicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589047/6605987/06606231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605987","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing-based resource allocation with security requirements for OFDM networks in real-time electricity market","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pricing-based resource allocation with security requirements for OFDM networks in real-time electricity market","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606231/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13886234","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6606231/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing-based resource allocation with security requirements for OFDM networks in real-time electricity market","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"244ASCC20130469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08072S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589047","isNumber":"6605987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589047","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6605987","articleId":"6606231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6606235,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rong-Jong","lastName":"Wai","id":"37271527600"},{"name":"Rajkumar Muthusamy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Muthusamy","id":"37074394200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5769-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5767-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6606235","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Fuzzy control","Vectors","Actuators","Fuzzy neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","DC motors","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","manipulator dynamics","neurocontrollers","numerical analysis","servomotors","stability","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy-neural-network control","intelligent control system","sliding-mode control design","n-link robot manipulator","actuator dynamics","high-precision position tracking","coupled higher-order dynamic model","FNNISMC scheme","fuzzy-neural-network inherited SMC scheme","chattering control","FNN framework","adaptive tuning algorithms","projection algorithm","Lyapunov stability theorem","network convergence","DC servo motors","numerical simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606235","abstract":"This study presents the design and analysis of an intelligent control system that inherits the robust properties of sliding-mode control (SMC) for an n-link robot manipulator including actuator dynamics in order to achieve a high-precision position tracking with a firm robustness.

Then, a conventional SMC scheme is developed for the joint position tracking of the robot manipulator. Moreover, a fuzzy-neural-network inherited SMC (FNNISMC) scheme is proposed to relax the requirement of detailed system information and deal with chattering control efforts in the SMC system. In the FNNISMC strategy, the FNN framework is designed to mimic the SMC law, and adaptive tuning algorithms for network parameters are derived in the sense of projection algorithm and Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure the network convergence as well as stable control performance.

The obtained solution is based on reducing the original energy-to-peak filtering problem to the corresponding mean-module filtering problem, using the technique proposed in [1]. The paper first presents the central energy-to-peak filter for linear systems, based on the optimal mean-module filter from [2], assuming the standard filtering conditions of stabilizability, detectability, and noise orthonormality. Finally, to relax the standard conditions, the paper presents the generalized version of the designed energy-to-peak filter in the absence of the noise orthonormality. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify performance of the designed energy-to-peak filter for linear systems against the central suboptimal H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n filter [3].

By introducing a nominal model and a sampled-data controller, it is possible to find the optimal solution iteratively of an optimization problem using gradient descent method. A feedback controller is introduced along the finite-time domain to ensure that the difference between the output of the nominal model and that of the actual plant can be made arbitrarily small. This feedback thus can be used to handle various uncertainties in the plant model, while the feedforward learning controller is used to ensure the convergence of the plant output to the optimal solution. Hence, by tuning sampling period and feedback gain matrix, it is possible to ensure that the output of plant converges semi-globally practically to the optimal solution. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Uncertainty","Trajectory","Vectors","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","feedforward","gradient methods","learning systems","matrix algebra","optimal control","sampled data systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online sampled-data optimal learning","dynamic systems","online optimal learning control","optimal performance","modeling uncertainties","measurement noise","iteration-varying initial conditions","nominal model","sampled-data controller","optimization problem","gradient descent method","feedback controller","finite-time domain","feedforward learning controller","sampling period tuning","feedback gain matrix"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606377","publicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589047/6605987/06606377.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On on-line sampled-data optimal learning for dynamic systems with uncertainties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On on-line sampled-data optimal learning for dynamic systems with uncertainties","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606377/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6606377/","accessionNumber":"13847739","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On on-line sampled-data optimal learning for dynamic systems with uncertainties","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"390ASCC20130720.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078464S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589047","isNumber":"6605987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589047","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6605987","articleId":"6606377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6606383,"authors":[{"name":"Jinna Li","affiliation":["Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Jinna","lastName":"Li","id":"37405656700"},{"name":"Lifeng Wei","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37071184500"},{"name":"Daqing Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Mathematics, University of Science and Technology Liaoning, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Daqing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37074261800"},{"name":"Chao Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Science, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599995700"},{"name":"Haibin Yu","affiliation":["Lab of Industrial Control Networks and Systems, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275014500"},{"name":"Qingling Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Science, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Qingling","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37275873000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5769-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5767-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6606383","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Actuators","Stability analysis","Delays","Educational institutions","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","linear matrix inequalities","networked control systems","sampling methods","stability","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMI technique","linear matrix inequalities","controller design","tracking control method","sampling period","stochastic stability","close-loop systems","sufficient condition","NCS","packet disordering","cognitive knowledge","networked control systems","sampling rate tracking control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606383","abstract":"This paper focuses on the sampling rate tracking control of networked control systems (NCSs) with packet disordering.

The total and additional prioritization strategies, which prioritize based on total numbers of elements covered per test, and numbers of additional (not-yet-covered) elements covered per test, are two widely-adopted generic strategies used for such prioritization. This paper proposes a basic model and an extended model that unify the total strategy and the additional strategy. Our models yield a spectrum of generic strategies ranging between the total and additional strategies, depending on a parameter referred to as the p value. We also propose four heuristics to obtain differentiated p values for different methods under test. We performed an empirical study on 19 versions of four Java programs to explore our results. Our results demonstrate that wide ranges of strategies in our basic and extended models with uniform p values can significantly outperform both the total and additional strategies. In addition, our results also demonstrate that using differentiated p values for both the basic and extended models with method coverage can even outperform the additional strategy using statement coverage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-26 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606565/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6606565/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13799307","conferenceDate":"18-26 May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Bridging the gap between the total and additional test-case prioritization strategies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridging the gap between the total and additional test-case prioritization strategies","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p192zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103632S","chronDate":"18-26 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596173","isNumber":"6606539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596173","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6606539","articleId":"6606565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6606584,"authors":[{"name":"Jaechang Nam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jaechang","lastName":"Nam","id":"37712728600"},{"name":"Sinno Jialin Pan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sinno Jialin","lastName":"Pan","id":"38230861600"},{"name":"Sunghun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Sunghun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404956600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3076-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3073-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"6606584","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":206,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1380},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Vectors","Predictive models","Standards","Data models","Training","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","public domain software","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transfer defect learning","software defect prediction approaches","within-project prediction settings","source projects","TCA+","feature distributions","open-source projects","cross-project defect prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cross-project defect prediction","transfer learning","empirical software engineering"]}],"abstract":"Many software defect prediction approaches have been proposed and most are effective in within-project prediction settings. However, for new projects or projects with limited training data, it is desirable to learn a prediction model by using sufficient training data from existing source projects and then apply the model to some target projects (cross-project defect prediction). Unfortunately, the performance of cross-project defect prediction is generally poor, largely because of feature distribution differences between the source and target projects. In this paper, we apply a state-of-the-art transfer learning approach, TCA, to make feature distributions in source and target projects similar. In addition, we propose a novel transfer defect learning approach, TCA+, by extending TCA. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that TCA+ significantly improves cross-project prediction performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606584","publicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596173/6606539/06606584.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer defect learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-26 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Transfer defect learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606584/","publicationDate":"May 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13799220","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6606584/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-26 May 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer defect learning","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p382nam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.147436S","chronDate":"18-26 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596173","isNumber":"6606539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596173","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"6606539","articleId":"6606584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6606585,"authors":[{"name":"Kim Herzig","affiliation":["Saarland University, Saarbrucken, Germany"],"firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Herzig","id":"37313970800"},{"name":"Sascha Just","affiliation":["Saarland University, Saarbrucken, Germany"],"firstName":"Sascha","lastName":"Just","id":"37700206600"},{"name":"Andreas Zeller","affiliation":["Saarland University, Saarbrucken, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Zeller","id":"37270132000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3076-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3073-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"6606585","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":157,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":797},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Manuals","Inspection","Databases","Documentation","Maintenance engineering","Computer bugs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","program debugging","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal refactoring","documentation","bug prediction model","bug reports misclassification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mining software repositories","bug reports","data quality","noise","bias"]}],"abstract":"In a manual examination of more than 7,000 issue reports from the bug databases of five open-source projects, we found 33.8% of all bug reports to be misclassified - that is, rather than referring to a code fix, they resulted in a new feature, an update to documentation, or an internal refactoring.

Modern statistical tools make it very easy to quickly build and deploy prediction models. Software metrics are at the heart of prediction models; understanding how and especially why different types of metrics are effective is very important for successful model deployment. In this paper we analyze the applicability and efficacy of process and code metrics from several different perspectives. We build many prediction models across 85 releases of 12 large open source projects to address the performance, stability, portability and stasis of different sets of metrics. Our results suggest that code metrics, despite widespread use in the defect prediction literature, are generally less useful than process metrics for prediction. Second, we find that code metrics have high stasis; they don't change very much from release to release. This leads to stagnation in the prediction models, leading to the same files being repeatedly predicted as defective; unfortunately, these recurringly defective files turn out to be comparatively less defect-dense.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606589","publicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596173/6606539/06606589.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606539","startPage":"432","endPage":"441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How, and why, process metrics are better","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"How, and why, process metrics are better","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-26 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606589/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-26 May 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13799222","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6606589/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How, and why, process metrics are better","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p432rahman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08559S","chronDate":"18-26 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596173","isNumber":"6606539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596173","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6606539","articleId":"6606589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6606597,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00f6ren Frey","affiliation":["Software Engineering Group, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"S\u00f6ren","lastName":"Frey","id":"37852133700"},{"name":"Florian Fittkau","affiliation":["Software Engineering Group, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Fittkau","id":"38541783000"},{"name":"Wilhelm Hasselbring","affiliation":["Software Engineering Group, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Wilhelm","lastName":"Hasselbring","id":"37267720000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3076-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3073-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"6606597","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":536},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606597","abstract":"Migrating existing enterprise software to cloud platforms involves the comparison of competing cloud deployment options (CDOs). A CDO comprises a combination of a specific cloud environment, deployment architecture, and runtime reconfiguration rules for dynamic resource scaling. Our simulator CDOSim can evaluate CDOs, e.g., regarding response times and costs. However, the design space to be searched for well-suited solutions is extremely huge. In this paper, we approach this optimization problem with the novel genetic algorithm CDOXplorer. It uses techniques of the search-based software engineering field and CDOSim to assess the fitness of CDOs. An experimental evaluation that employs, among others, the cloud environments Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Windows Azure, shows that CDOXplorer can find solutions that surpass those of other state-of-the-art techniques by up to 60%. Our experiment code and data and an implementation of CDOXplorer are available as open source

tasks, by enabling software textual retrieval and analysis. In all these approaches, topic models have been used on software artifacts in a similar manner as they were used on natural language documents (e.g., using the same settings and parameters) because the underlying assumption was that source code and natural language documents are similar. However, applying topic models on software data using the same settings as for natural language text did not always produce the expected results. Recent research investigated this assumption and showed that source code is much more repetitive and predictable as compared to the natural language text. Our paper builds on this new fundamental finding and proposes a novel solution to adapt, configure and effectively use a topic modeling technique, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to achieve better (acceptable) performance across various SE tasks. Our paper introduces a novel solution called LDA-GA, which uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to determine a near-optimal configuration for LDA in the context of three different SE tasks: (1) traceability link recovery, (2) feature location, and (3) software artifact labeling. The results of our empirical studies demonstrate that LDA-GA is able to identify robust LDA configurations, which lead to a higher accuracy on all the datasets for these SE tasks as compared to previously published results, heuristics, and the results of a combinatorial search.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606598","publicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596173/6606539/06606598.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to effectively use topic models for software engineering tasks?

Unfortunately, human resources are often insufficient to fix all reported and known bugs. To address this issue, several automated patch generation techniques have been proposed. In particular, a genetic-programming-based patch generation technique, GenProg, proposed by Weimer et al., has shown promising results. However, these techniques can generate nonsensical patches due to the randomness of their mutation operations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel patch generation approach, Pattern-based Automatic program Repair (Par), using fix patterns learned from existing human-written patches. We manually inspected more than 60,000 human-written patches and found there are several common fix patterns. Our approach leverages these fix patterns to generate program patches automatically. We experimentally evaluated Par on 119 real bugs. In addition, a user study involving 89 students and 164 developers confirmed that patches generated by our approach are more acceptable than those generated by GenProg. Par successfully generated patches for 27 out of 119 bugs, while GenProg was successful for only 16 bugs.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606626","startPage":"802","endPage":"811","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596173/6606539/06606626.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic patch generation learned from human-written patches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-26 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Automatic patch generation learned from human-written patches","conferenceDate":"18-26 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6606626/","accessionNumber":"13799291","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606626/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic patch generation learned from human-written patches","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p802kim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080217S","chronDate":"18-26 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596173","isNumber":"6606539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596173","citationCount":"227","xplore-issue":"6606539","articleId":"6606626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6606629,"authors":[{"name":"Peter C.

When evaluated on 188 StackOverflow answer posts containing 993 code elements, the technique performs with average 0.92 precision and 0.90 recall. As a major refinement on traditional traceability approaches, we also propose to detect which of the code elements in a document are salient, or germane, to the topic of the post.

When a query performs poorly, it has to be reformulated and this is a difficult task for someone who had trouble writing a good query in the first place. We propose a recommender (called Refoqus) based on machine learning, which is trained with a sample of queries and relevant results. Then, for a given query, it automatically recommends a reformulation strategy that should improve its performance, based on the properties of the query. We evaluated Refoqus empirically against four baseline approaches that are used in natural language document retrieval. The data used for the evaluation corresponds to changes from five open source systems in Java and C++ and it is used in the context of TR-based concept location in source code. Refoqus outperformed the baselines and its recommendations lead to query performance improvement or preservation in 84% of the cases (in average).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-26 May 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-26 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6606630/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13799248","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automatic query reformulations for text retrieval in software engineering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic query reformulations for text retrieval in software engineering","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p842haiduc.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077968S","chronDate":"18-26 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596173","isNumber":"6606539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596173","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6606539","articleId":"6606630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6606683,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Bagheri","affiliation":["University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Bagheri","id":"37839769000"},{"name":"Kevin Sullivan","affiliation":["University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Sullivan","id":"37284180800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3076-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3073-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"6606683","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Concrete","Object oriented modeling","Software","Metals","Productivity","Software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation languages","software architecture","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bottom-up model-driven development","long-term viability","MDD","abstract representations","ad-hoc modeling languages","general-purpose specification languages","healthcare-related experimental system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model-driven development","Bottom-up","Partial synthesis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606683","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606539","publicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596173/6606539/06606683.pdf","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bottom-up model-driven development","abstract":"Prominent researchers and leading practitioners are questioning the long-term viability of model-driven development (MDD). Finkelstein recently ranked MDD as a bottom-ten research area, arguing that an approach based entirely on development and refinement of abstract representations is untenable. His view is that working with concrete artifacts is necessary for learning what to build and how to build it. What if this view is correct? Could MDD be rescued from such a critique? We suggest the answer is yes, but that it requires an inversion of traditional views of transformational MDD. Rather than develop complete, abstract system models, in ad-hoc modeling languages, followed by top-down synthesis of hidden concrete artifacts, we envision that engineers will continue to develop concrete artifacts, but over time will recognize patterns and concerns that can profitably be lifted, from the bottom-up, to the level of partial models, in general-purpose specification languages, from which visible concrete artifacts are generated, becoming part of the base of both concrete and abstract artifacts for subsequent rounds of development. This paper reports on recent work that suggests this approach is viable, and explores ramifications of such a rethinking of MDD. Early validation flows from experience applying these ideas to a healthcare-related experimental system in our lab.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-26 May 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-26 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6606683/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13799208","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bottom-up model-driven development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bottom-up model-driven development","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1221bagheri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061395S","chronDate":"18-26 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596173","isNumber":"6606539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596173","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6606539","articleId":"6606683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6606707,"authors":[{"name":"John Jacobellis","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Jacobellis","id":"37075211200"},{"name":"Na Meng","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Meng","id":"37660438200"},{"name":"Miryung Kim","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Miryung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278674600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3076-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3073-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"6606707","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606707","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Systematics","Abstracts","Syntactics","Software","Concrete","Cloning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program diagnostics","software engineering","software tools","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LASE","example-based program transformation tool","systematic edits","Eclipse plug-in","context-aware edit scripts","edit location identification","code transformation","syntactic edit operations","inferred edit abstraction level","edit context","customized edits","edit suggestion"]}],"abstract":"Adding features and fixing bugs in software often require systematic edits which are similar, but not identical, changes to many code locations. Finding all edit locations and editing them correctly is tedious and error-prone. In this paper, we demonstrate an Eclipse plug-in called Lase that (1) creates context-aware edit scripts from two or more examples, and uses these scripts to (2) automatically identify edit locations and (3) transform the code. In Lase, users can view syntactic edit operations and corresponding context for each input example. They can also choose a different subset of the examples to adjust the abstraction level of inferred edits. When Lase locates target methods matching the inferred edit context and suggests customized edits, users can review and correct LASE's edit suggestion. These features can reduce developers' burden in repetitively applying similar edits to different methods.

By large we mean lines of code in the range of hundreds of thousands or millions. Our research objective is to improve the process of handling anomaly reports for large organizations. Specifically, we are addressing the problem of the manual, laborious and time consuming process of assigning anomaly reports to the correct design teams and the related issue of localizing faults in the system architecture. In large organizations, with complex systems, this is particularly problematic because the receiver of an anomaly report may not have detailed knowledge of the whole system. As a consequence, anomaly reports may be assigned to the wrong team in the organization, causing delays and unnecessary work. We have so far developed two machine learning prototypes to validate our approach. The latest, a re-implementation and extension, of the first is being evaluated on four large systems at Ericsson AB. Our main goal is to investigate how large software development organizations can significantly improve development efficiency by replacing manual anomaly report assignment and fault localization with machine learning techniques. Our approach focuses on training machine learning systems on anomaly report databases; this is in contrast to many other approaches that are based on test case execution combined with program sampling and/or source code analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-26 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13799297","htmlLink":"/document/6606717/","conferenceDate":"18-26 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Increasing anomaly handling efficiency in large organizations using applied machine learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing anomaly handling efficiency in large organizations using applied machine learning","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1361jonsson.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046424S","chronDate":"18-26 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596173","isNumber":"6606539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596173","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6606539","articleId":"6606717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6606801,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Qi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Qi","id":"37405517500"},{"name":"Rongrong Qian","affiliation":["Automation School and also with the Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongrong","lastName":"Qian","id":"37399014800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6606801","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":737},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","MIMO","Detection algorithms","Uplink","Upper bound","Error probability","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output detection","variable-complexity MIMO detection","multiple-user system","complexity outage probability","Chernoff-type upper bound","closed-form expression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complexity","Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","MIMO detection","performance"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents the complexity study of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection in a multiple-user scenario.

However, the spectrum of pure ground objects, known as endmember, must be known previously. In this paper, the HNN is utilized to solve unsupervised SMA, in which Endmember Extraction (EE) and Abundance Estimation (AE) are performed iteratively. Two different HNNs are constructed to solve such multiplicative updating procedure, respectively. The proposed HNN based unsupervised SMA framework is then applied to solve three second-order constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) models for SMA, including Minimum Distance Constrained NMF (MDC-NMF), Minimum endmember-wise Distance Constrained NMF (MewDC-NMF), and Minimum Dispersion Constrained NMF (MiniDisCo-NMF). As a result, our proposed HNN based algorithms are able to perform unsupervised SMA and extract virtual endmembers without assuming the presence of spectrally pure constituents in highly mixed hyperspectral data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real hyperspectral images demonstrate that our proposed HNN based algorithms clearly outperform traditional Projected Gradient (PG) based solutions for these constrained NMF based SMA.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2281414","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6870503/06606813.pdf","startPage":"1922","endPage":"1935","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2281414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6870503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Spectral Mixture Analysis of Highly Mixed Data With Hopfield Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Spectral Mixture Analysis of Highly Mixed Data With Hopfield Neural Network","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2014","accessionNumber":"14501012","publicationDate":"June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6606813/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Spectral Mixture Analysis of Highly Mixed Data With Hopfield Neural Network","sourcePdf":"jstars-mei-2281414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121181S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6870503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6870503","articleId":"6606813","onlineDate":"23 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6606815,"authors":[{"name":"Xing He","affiliation":["Southwest University, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"He","id":"37085691572"},{"name":"Chuandong Li","affiliation":["Southwest University, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Chuandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37278182900"},{"name":"Tingwen Huang","affiliation":["Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Tingwen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37534208200"},{"name":"Chaojie Li","affiliation":["University of Ballarat, School of Science, Information Technology and Engineering, Mt Helen, Australia"],"firstName":"Chaojie","lastName":"Li","id":"37085388816"},{"name":"Junjian Huang","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Education, School of Computer Science, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Junjian","lastName":"Huang","id":"37657416000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"6606815","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Linear programming","Programming profession","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","Lyapunov methods","numerical analysis","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","bilevel linear programming problem","penalty functions","differential inclusion","BLPP","state variables","nonsmooth analysis","Lyapunov-like method","equilibrium point sequence","optimal solution","numerical simulation","supply chain distribution model","recurrent NN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilevel linear programming problem (BLPP)","differential inclusions","nonsmooth analysis","recurrent neural network (NN)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Programming, Linear"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, based on the method of penalty functions, a recurrent neural network (NN) modeled by means of a differential inclusion is proposed for solving the bilevel linear programming problem (BLPP).

The SoC includes a two-channel ECG front-end with a driven-right-leg circuit, an 8-bit SAR ADC, a custom-designed 16-bit microcontroller, two banks of 16 kb SRAM, and a MICS band transceiver. The microcontroller and SRAM blocks are able to operate at sub-/near-threshold regime for the best energy consumption. The proposed SoC has been implemented in a standard 0.13- \u03bcm CMOS process. Measurement results show the microcontroller consumes only 2.62 pJ per instruction at 0.35 V . Both microcontroller and memory blocks are functional down to 0.25 V.

Based on the probability density function (pdf) approach, we derive new exact and approximated closed-form expressions for the average detection probability and the average false alarm probability employing two diversity combining techniques, namely, the maximal ratio combining (MRC) scheme and the selection combining (SC) scheme. We also investigate the convergence rate of infinite series that appears in the derived exact closed-form expressions and propose to use a powerful acceleration algorithm that allows for the series termination with a finite number of terms. The results obtained reveal the importance of including the relaying link statistics and the combination techniques in the performance analysis of CR networks. The derived closed-form expression can be used to determine the energy threshold and the relaying power constraint that meet a given detection accuracy value over nonidentically distributed Nakagami- m fading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14159239","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6606840/","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Form Analysis of Relay-Based Cognitive Radio Networks Over Nakagami- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Closed-Form Analysis of Relay-Based Cognitive Radio Networks Over Nakagami- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-hussain-2283078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114699S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6766688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6766688","articleId":"6606840","onlineDate":"23 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6606847,"authors":[{"name":"Junghwan Son","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Junghwan","lastName":"Son","id":"37532121500"},{"name":"Ildu Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Ltd., Suwon, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Ildu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291701800"},{"name":"Seokhyeon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Seokhyeon","lastName":"Kim","id":"38183943900"},{"name":"Bumman Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Bumman","lastName":"Kim","id":"37276226900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6606847","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1255},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Predistortion","Power amplifiers","Modulation","Long Term Evolution","Peak to average power ratio","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential digital predistortion architecture","two-stage envelope tracking power amplifier","drive amplifier","Long Term Evolution signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion (DPD)","drive amplifier (DA)","long term evolution (LTE)","main amplifier (MA)","two stage envelope tracking (ET)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606847","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2013.2280637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2013.2280637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6654297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/6654297/06606847.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Digital Predistortion for Two-stage Envelope Tracking Power Amplifier","abstract":"To improve the efficiency of the main power amplifier, the envelope tracking technique is widely used.

The envelope tracking technique is applied to both the drive and main power amplifiers to improve efficiency of the drive amplifier, which is usually operated at a low efficiency.

A six-leg inverter with a single dc link is associated with the machine in order to use a single energy source. With this topology, the zero-sequence circuit has to be considered since the zero-sequence current can circulate in the windings. Therefore, conventional overmodulation strategies are not appropriate when the machine enters in the flux-weakening region. A few solutions dealing with the zero-sequence circuit have been proposed in the literature. They use a modified space vector modulation or a conventional modulation with additional voltage limitations. This paper describes the aforementioned strategies, and then, a new strategy is proposed. This new strategy takes into account the magnitudes and phase angles of the voltage harmonic components. This yields better voltage utilization in the dq frame. Furthermore, inverter saturation is avoided in the zero-sequence frame, and therefore, zero-sequence current control is maintained. Three methods are implemented on a test bed composed of a three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous machine, a six-leg inverter, and a hybrid digital signal processor /field-programmable gate array controller. Experimental results are presented and compared for all strategies.

It reviews the architectures, economics, and techniques for converged optical fiber indoor networks, which are cost- and energy-efficient, and compares them with current copper-based solutions. Particular attention is given to high-capacity multimode (plastic) optical fiber techniques, radio-over-fiber techniques, techniques for providing capacity on demand, and optical wireless communication techniques. An evolution perspective is outlined how the growing indoor communication demands can be met by introducing these powerful techniques and network architectures.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6701330/06606885.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"604","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2283145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2283145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonic Home Area Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Optical fiber cables","Topology","Network topology","Optical fiber networks","Ducts","Power cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["home networks","indoor communication","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photonic home area networks","converged optical fiber indoor networks","high-capacity multimode optical fiber techniques","radio-over-fiber techniques","optical wireless communication techniques","indoor communication","evolution perspective"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor communication","indoor radio communication","optical fiber communication","optical wireless communication","plastic optical fiber","radio over fiber"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Photonic Home Area Networks","volume":"32","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14021129","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonic Home Area Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-koonen-2283145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067894S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","isNumber":"6701330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"62","articleId":"6606885","onlineDate":"23 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6606888,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge F.

A set of cancellation subcarriers are modulated by appropriate linear combinations of the remaining data subcarriers. The combination weights are fixed so that, in contrast with previous AIC approaches, they need not be recomputed on a symbol-by-symbol basis. Weight optimization can thus be carried out offline, drastically reducing the online computational cost. In addition, it is shown that by carefully selecting the location of cancellation subcarriers, significant performance improvements can be achieved. Given that finding the optimal location is an intractable combinatorial problem, an heuristic approach is proposed, based on a greedy search which provides a good tradeoff. The proposed scheme is shown to outperform current AIC solutions both in terms of performance and computational cost, obtaining significant improvements in terms of notch depth, with almost 50 dB depth in typical settings, to protect a narrowband PU inside the secondary user OFDM band. Further, experimental measurements from the implementation of the proposed scheme on both professional and off-the-shelf hardware platforms validate its effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2013.2280808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/6678128/06606888.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2013.2280808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6678128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Choose Your Subcarriers Wisely: Active Interference Cancellation for Cognitive OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606888/","displayDocTitle":"Choose Your Subcarriers Wisely: Active Interference Cancellation for Cognitive OFDM","volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13969835","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6606888/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choose Your Subcarriers Wisely: Active Interference Cancellation for Cognitive OFDM","sourcePdf":"jetcas-schmidt-2280808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088048S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6678128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6678128","articleId":"6606888","onlineDate":"23 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6606903,"authors":[{"name":"Hoyong Hwang","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, Soongsil University, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hoyong","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37085582805"},{"name":"Changkun Park","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, Soongsil University, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Changkun","lastName":"Park","id":"37291057500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6606903","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1182},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606903","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Radio frequency","Regulators","Power demand","Frequency measurement","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade networks","driver circuits","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current shared cascade structure","driver stages","switching mode RF power amplifiers","power efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifier","cascade","efficiency","supply voltage"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we propose a current shared cascade (CSC) structure for the driver stages of switching mode RF power amplifiers (PAs); this CSC is designed using a differential structure.

The proposed method gives an online estimation of mode frequency and damping ratio as well as mode shapes using multi-channel measurement data. It exploits both the accuracy of subspace identification and fast computational capability of recursive methods.

The forecasting model uses 52 Neural Network (NN) sub-models and five Gaussian Process (GP) sub-models in parallel. For 48 hours, the NN sub-models forecast the future wind power based on historical wind power data and forecasted wind information. In parallel, for the first five hours, five GP sub-models are used to forecast wind power using only historical wind power in order to provide accurate wind power forecasts to NN sub-models. These models provide various forecasts for the same hour, so the optimal forecast should be decided from overlapped forecasts by the decision process.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2280649","startPage":"501","endPage":"510","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6693741/06606922.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2280649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Wind Power Ensemble Prediction Based on Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind forecasting","Wind power generation","Predictive models","Wind speed","Forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","load forecasting","neural nets","power system simulation","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision process","GP submodel","Gaussian process submodel","NN submodel","neural network submodel","PES","Power and Energy Society","wind farm","short-term wind power forecasting model","short-term wind power ensemble prediction","time 48 h","time 5 hour"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ensemble forecasting","Gaussian process","neural network","wind power forecasting competition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Wind Power Ensemble Prediction Based on Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6606922/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"13998173","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Wind Power Ensemble Prediction Based on Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tsg-lee-2280649-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13338S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6693741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6693741","articleId":"6606922","onlineDate":"23 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6606924,"authors":[{"name":"Cuong Huynh","affiliation":["The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Cuong","lastName":"Huynh","id":"37542278700"},{"name":"Cam Nguyen","affiliation":["The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Cam","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37275484600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"6606924","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1684},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606924","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Harmonic analysis","Impedance matching","Transistors","Inductors","Power generation","Power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys","impedance matching","microwave filters","millimetre wave filters","millimetre wave power amplifiers","MMIC power amplifiers","semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent dual-band impedance-matching filtering networks","SiGe BiCMOS","concurrent dual-band power amplifier","dual-bandpass filtering response","single-band mode","concurrent dual-band mode","size 0.18 mum","frequency 25.5 GHz","frequency 37 GHz","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-band matching","dual-band power amplifier (PA)","multiband matching","multiband PA","RF integrated circuit (RFIC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2281035","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6651712/06606924.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"3927","endPage":"3939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6651712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2281035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Technique for Synthesizing Concurrent Dual-Band Impedance-Matching Filtering Networks and -

The technique enables the design of concurrent dual-band impedance-matching filtering networks that provide not only simultaneous matching of two arbitrary loads to two arbitrary sources at two different frequencies, but also dual-bandpass filtering response capable of suppressing unwanted signals like the harmonics and inter-modulation products in nonlinear circuits, such as power amplifiers (PAs). A new 0.18-\u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS concurrent dual-band PA was designed based on the developed dual-band matching filtering technique around 25.5 and 37 GHz, which works in the concurrent dual-band mode (25.5 and 37 GHz), as well as single-band mode (25.5 or 37 GHz). The measured results show that, in the single-band mode, the dual-band PA exhibits gain of 21.4 and 17 dB, maximum output power of 16 and 13 dBm, and maximum power-added efficiency (PAE) of 10.6% and 4.9% at 25.5 and 37 GHz, respectively.

A detailed theoretical analysis for the performance operating mechanism is demonstrated. With the assistance of mutually inductive coupling introduced, a pair of tunable transmission zeros (TZs) is synthesized at the lower passband edges and significantly improves the filter selectivity. Experiments are carried out by using the liquid crystal polymer bonded multilayer printed circuit board technology to validate the design. It is found that the implemented filter achieves a wide continuous tuning range covering from 1030 to 2150 MHz with low insertion loss, and which indeed are limited by the Schottky diodes used. It is also illustrated that two measured TZs are properly controlled at each tuning stage, which not only offers a sharp cutoff frequency response with a rejection level greater than 22 dB, but also provides an approximately unchanged response shape. Good agreement between the measured and simulated results can finally be observed.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2281964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6651712/06606925.pdf","startPage":"3853","endPage":"3859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2281964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6651712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Varactor-Tuned Microstrip High-Pass Filter With a Quasi-Elliptic Function Response","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606925/","displayDocTitle":"Compact Varactor-Tuned Microstrip High-Pass Filter With a Quasi-Elliptic Function Response","volume":"61","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13887174","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6606925/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Varactor-Tuned Microstrip High-Pass Filter With a Quasi-Elliptic Function Response","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ni-2281964-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075856S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6651712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6651712","articleId":"6606925","onlineDate":"23 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6606930,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew C.

The proposed method incorporates geometrical variation into the FDTD algorithm by appropriately parameterizing and distorting the rectilinear and curvilinear computational lattices. Generalized polynomial chaos is used to expand the time-domain electric and magnetic fields in terms of orthogonal polynomial chaos basis functions of the uncertain mesh parameters. The technique is validated by modeling several microstrip circuits with uncertain physical dimensions and geometry. The computed S-parameters are compared against Monte Carlo simulations, and good agreement for the statistics is observed over 0-25 GHz. A considerable computational advantage over the Monte Carlo method is also achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2281777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6677550/06606930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2281777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677550","startPage":"4293","endPage":"4301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Analysis of Geometrical Uncertainty in the FDTD Method Using Polynomial Chaos With Application to Microwave Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6606930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Analysis of Geometrical Uncertainty in the FDTD Method Using Polynomial Chaos With Application to Microwave Circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13933787","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6606930/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Analysis of Geometrical Uncertainty in the FDTD Method Using Polynomial Chaos With Application to Microwave Circuits","sourcePdf":"tmtt-austin-2281777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074234S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6677550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6677550","articleId":"6606930","onlineDate":"23 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6606932,"authors":[{"name":"Tingyan Guo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Tingyan Guo (GS'11) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering in 2011 from the University of Manchester, U.K., where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree."]},"firstName":"Tingyan","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085378150"},{"name":"Jovica V.

Generator rotor angles and speeds provided by PMUs during post-fault condition are chosen as predictors. The performance of the DT based prediction method is tested using a wide variety of disturbances with probabilistically modeled locations, durations, types of fault and the system loading levels. The accuracy of prediction is approximately 98.5% immediately following the fault clearance and can increase to almost 100% if the prediction is made 2.5 s after the fault clearance.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2281118","startPage":"377","endPage":"385","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6684613/06606932.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2281118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Framework for Assessing the Accuracy of Data Mining Tool for Online Prediction of Transient Stability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Accuracy","Stability analysis","Rotors","Data mining","Training","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","decision trees","phasor measurement","power engineering computing","power system transient stability","probability","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic framework","data mining tool accuracy","transient stability online prediction","generic probabilistic framework","online prediction","power system transient stability","phasor measurement unit","PMU measurements","data mining techniques","data mining models","decision tree method","data mining technique","16-machine","68-bus test power system","generator rotor angles","post-fault condition","DT based prediction method","system loading levels","fault clearance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accuracy","data mining","decision tree","phasor measurement units","power system transient stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6606932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Framework for Assessing the Accuracy of Data Mining Tool for Online Prediction of Transient Stability","volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6606932/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13973446","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Framework for Assessing the Accuracy of Data Mining Tool for Online Prediction of Transient Stability","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-milanovic-2281118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077312S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6684613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6684613","articleId":"6606932","onlineDate":"23 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6606978,"authors":[{"name":"Ilgyu Choi","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Ilgyu","lastName":"Choi","id":"37075353500"},{"name":"Chungyong Lee","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Chungyong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280420600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2504-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2500-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2501-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2502-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6606978","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Coherence","Channel estimation","Data communication","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","data communication","MIMO communication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser system","tradeoff point","concavity","effective rate maximization","data rate","data transmission time","coherence time","estimation time","base station","CSI","channel state information","large MIMO system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["large MIMO","tradeoff","effective rate"]}],"abstract":"Large MIMO system can achieve high data rate with simple linear transceiver. However, for this advantage, long time is required to estimate channel state information (CSI) at base station (BS).

With long estimation time, data rate increases, but data transmission time decreases. Otherwise, with short estimation time, data rate decreases, but data transmission time increases.

Likewise previous wireless standards, where the modeling helped in a better understanding of the concepts and played an important role in extending the outreach of the technology and subsequent innovations, the modeling of IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks (WRANs) is a necessity. In this work, we accomplish this task using the theory of queues. To that end, we model the dynamics of each cognitive user, termed customer premises equipments (CPE) according to the standard terminology, with a 2-D Markov chain. Given this model, we show that a WRAN cell can be modeled as a Jackson network. We also find the probability mass function (PMF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the CPE queue length, from which any higher moment can be derived. Notable is the fact that said PMF is expressed in an exact closed-form. In addition to the nodal analysis, a WRAN cell-level discussion is conducted by finding the stability condition and peer-to-peer delay. Moreover, we provide preliminary results on the resource allocation in WRANs, which is a very important area of focus and discovery for an efficient deployment and operation of future WRANs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13795412","htmlLink":"/document/6607132/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Cognitive Radio Based IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Cognitive Radio Based IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Networks","sourcePdf":"4363-tw1309-navid.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067451S","chronDate":"September  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6607129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6607129","articleId":"6607132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6607140,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Kato","affiliation":["EV System Laboratory, Nissan Motor Company, Ltd., Atsugi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6816009/6607140/kato-2283314-small.gif","p":["\nTakashi Kato (M\u201910) received the B.S. degree in mechanical system\nengineering from Kansai University, Osaka, Japan, in 1997.","In 2001, he joined the Nissan Research Center, Atsugi, Japan, where he has contributed to electric machine design and\ncontrol.

Unlike the sum-rate maximization for a single-code CDMA system, the optimization requires the joint optimal distribution of each user's power to its multiple data streams as well as the optimal design of signature sequences. The crucial step is to establish an equivalence of the multicode CDMA system to restricted frequency-division multiple-access (FDMA) and time-division multiple-access (TDMA) systems. The CDMA system has upper limits on the numbers of multicodes of users, whereas the FDMA system has upper limits on the bandwidths, and the TDMA system has upper limits on the duty cycles of users. The equivalence facilitates the complete characterization of the maximum sum rate of the multicode CDMA system and also provides new insights into single- and multicode CDMA systems in terms of the parameters of the equivalent FDMA and TDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2283223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6670132/06607152.pdf","startPage":"8295","endPage":"8317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2283223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-Rate Optimal Multicode CDMA Systems: An Equivalence Result","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607152/","displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate Optimal Multicode CDMA Systems: An Equivalence Result","volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914288","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-Rate Optimal Multicode CDMA Systems: An Equivalence Result","sourcePdf":"tit-cho-2283223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064478S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6670132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","articleId":"6607152","onlineDate":"24 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6607153,"authors":[{"name":"Hsueh-Hsien Chang","affiliation":["JinWen University of Science and Technology, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6816009/6607153/chang-2283318-small.gif","p":["\nHsueh-Hsien Chang (S'05\u2013M'05) was born in Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 1966.\nHe received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1994\nand 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Chung Yuan Christian University, Jhongli, Taiwan, in 2009, all in\nelectrical engineering.","From 1996 to 1998, he was a Project and System Engineer with ABB Ltd., Taipei.

We show that this method can be viewed as a combination of filtered backprojection steps, and, therefore, has a relatively low computational cost.

Incipient fault detection has received reasonable attention in recent years. In this paper, a method based on complex wavelets is proposed for incipient fault detection and condition monitoring. A complex wavelet-support vector machine (SVM) classifier-based method is developed which takes into account four conditions: healthy, turn fault (TF) under balanced supply conditions, voltage imbalance, and interturn fault with voltage imbalance, both occurring at the same time. The performance metrics show the ability of the technique to identify the fault at an early stage and it also provides additional information regarding which of the four conditions is prevailing at a given time. Voltage imbalance and turn fault are often confused. Both affect the performance of the machine and the unbalanced voltage condition considerably reduces the winding insulation life due to overheating. This necessitates the precise identification of the supply condition along with the fault diagnosis. A comparison of the proposed method with standard discrete wavelet transform (DWT) shows its effectiveness in providing reliable information under variable supply-frequency conditions. The proposed technique is also tested in presence of high resistance connections (HRCs), which shows its isolating capability.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2013.2283212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/6816009/06607161.pdf","startPage":"2235","endPage":"2242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2013.2283212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incipient Turn Fault Detection and Condition Monitoring of Induction Machine Using Analytical Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607161/","displayDocTitle":"Incipient Turn Fault Detection and Condition Monitoring of Induction Machine Using Analytical Wavelet Transform","volume":"50","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 2014","accessionNumber":"14318140","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607161/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India","grantNumber":"RP02183"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incipient Turn Fault Detection and Condition Monitoring of Induction Machine Using Analytical Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tia-seshadrinath-2283212-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106976S","chronDate":"May-June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6816009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6816009","articleId":"6607161","onlineDate":"24 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6607162,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Ren","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6832663/6607162/ren-2279802-small.gif","p":["Zhigang Ren (M'12) received the B.Sc. degree in information and computing science from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2010.","He is currently a Lecturer with the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University.

Its performance depends heavily on the characteristics of the employed exemplars. This necessitates considering both the fitness and the distribution of exemplars in designing PSO algorithms. Following this idea, we propose a novel PSO variant, called scatter learning PSO algorithm (SLPSOA) for multimodal problems. SLPSOA contains some new algorithmic features while following the basic framework of PSO. It constructs an exemplar pool (EP) that is composed of a certain number of relatively high-quality solutions scattered in the solution space, and requires particles to select their exemplars from EP using the roulette wheel rule. By this means, more promising solution regions can be found. In addition, SLPSOA employs Solis and Wets' algorithm as a local searcher to enhance its fine search ability in the newfound solution regions. To verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we test it on a set of 16 benchmark functions and compare it with six existing typical PSO algorithms. Computational results demonstrate that SLPSOA can prevent premature convergence and produce competitive solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","volume":"44","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14396440","pubMedId":"24108491","htmlLink":"/document/6607162/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Scatter Learning Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Multimodal Problems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61105126, 51177126 and 61203350"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation of the Ministry of Education, China","grantNumber":"20100201110031"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scatter Learning Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Multimodal Problems","sourcePdf":"tcyb-ren-2279802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144779S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6832663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6832663","articleId":"6607162","onlineDate":"24 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6607175,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Ishimaru","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6782669/6607175/6607175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Akira Ishimaru (M'58\u2013SM'63\u2013F'73-LF'94) received the B.S. degree from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1951 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, in 1958.","From 1951 to 1952, he was with the Electrotechnical Laboratory, Tanashi, Tokyo, and in 1956, he was with Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, USA.

The higher modulation order results in an increase in the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which degrades the nonlinear tolerance. To overcome this problem, we propose a discrete cosine transform (DCT)-precoded optical FOFDM system. The proposed system does not require a higher modulation order. Therefore, the proposed DCT-precoded optical FOFDM system has a lower PAPR characteristic than the DFT-precoded FOFDM system. The lowest PAPR characteristic of the proposed system enables superior nonlinear tolerance compared with other FOFDM systems.

Most of the existing array systems assume that the desired sources are in the broadside direction. In this paper, we study and analyze the performance of the MVDR beamformer as a function of the source incidence angle. Using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and beampattern as the criteria, we investigate its performance in four different scenarios: spatially white noise, diffuse noise, diffuse-plus-white noise, and point-source-plus-white noise. The results demonstrate that the optimal performance of the MVDR beamformer occurs when the source is in the endfire directions for diffuse noise and point-source noise while its SNR gain does not depend on the signal incidence angle in spatially white noise. This indicates that most current systems may not fully exploit the potential of the MVDR beamformer. This analysis does not only help us better understand this algorithm, but also helps us design better array systems for practical applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2013.2283104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663728","startPage":"67","endPage":"79","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6663728/06607198.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Study of the MVDR Beamformer as a Function of the Source Incidence Angle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6607198/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Study of the MVDR Beamformer as a Function of the Source Incidence Angle","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13914038","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Study of the MVDR Beamformer as a Function of the Source Incidence Angle","sourcePdf":"tasl-pan-2283104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084219S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6663728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6663728","articleId":"6607198","onlineDate":"24 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6607203,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Sun","affiliation":["Department of ECE, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yin Sun (S'08\u2013M'11) received the B.

We study the optimal transmit covariance matrix design to achieve the capacity of compound MIMO Gaussian channels, where the channel uncertainty region is characterized by the spectral norm. This design problem is a challenging nonconvex optimization problem. However, in this paper, we reveal that this problem has a hidden convexity property, which can be exploited to map the problem into a convex optimization problem. We first prove that the optimal transmit design is to diagonalize the nominal channel, and then show that the duality gap between the capacity of the compound MIMO Gaussian channel and the min-max channel capacity is zero, which proves and generalizes a conjecture of Loyka and Charalambous. The key tools for showing these results are a new matrix determinant inequality and some unitarily invariant properties.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6670132/06607203.pdf","startPage":"8267","endPage":"8274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2283222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2283222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of Compound MIMO Gaussian Channels With Additive Uncertainty","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","MIMO","Covariance matrices","Compounds","Linear matrix inequalities","Vectors","Convex functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compound MIMO Gaussian channels","additive uncertainty","multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian channel","channel matrix","channel uncertainty region","nominal channel matrix","optimal transmit covariance matrix design","nonconvex optimization problem","duality gap","min-max channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel uncertainty","compound channel","hidden convexity","multiple antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of Compound MIMO Gaussian Channels With Additive Uncertainty","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6607203/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914284","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of Compound MIMO Gaussian Channels With Additive Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tit-sun-2283222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.375766S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6670132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6670132","articleId":"6607203","onlineDate":"24 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6607209,"authors":[{"name":"Xinhao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Control Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6609090/6607209/6607209-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinhao Liu received the bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2010, and the master's degrees in mechanical and control engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

For example, the performance of an image denoising algorithm can be much degraded due to the poor noise level estimation. Most existing denoising algorithms simply assume the noise level is known that largely prevents them from practical use. Moreover, even with the given true noise level, these denoising algorithms still cannot achieve the best performance, especially for scenes with rich texture. In this paper, we propose a patch-based noise level estimation algorithm and suggest that the noise level parameter should be tuned according to the scene complexity. Our approach includes the process of selecting low-rank patches without high frequency components from a single noisy image. The selection is based on the gradients of the patches and their statistics. Then, the noise level is estimated from the selected patches using principal component analysis. Because the true noise level does not always provide the best performance for nonblind denoising algorithms, we further tune the noise level parameter for nonblind denoising. Experiments demonstrate that both the accuracy and stability are superior to the state of the art noise level estimation algorithm for various scenes and noise levels.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2283400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2283400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6609090/06607209.pdf","startPage":"5226","endPage":"5237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Image Noise Level Estimation for Blind Denoising","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Single-Image Noise Level Estimation for Blind Denoising","volume":"22","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607209/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13821693","pubMedId":"24108465","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607209/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Image Noise Level Estimation for Blind Denoising","sourcePdf":"tip-liu-2283400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127189S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6609090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"224","xplore-issue":"6609090","articleId":"6607209","onlineDate":"24 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6607217,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Chandra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6675045/6607217/6607217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rohit Chandra received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees (Integrated) from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India, in 2008.

An analytical propagation model is useful to estimate the ear-to-ear link loss for such binaural hearing aids. This paper presents an analytical model for the deterministic component of the ear-to-ear link loss. The model takes into account the dominant paths having most of the power of the creeping wave from the transceiver in one ear to the transceiver in the other ear, and the effect of the protruding part of the outer ear, called pinna. Simulations are done to validate the model using in-the-ear placement of antennas at 2.45 GHz on numerical heterogeneous phantoms of different age-groups and head sizes showing a good agreement with the model. The ear-to-ear link loss for a numerical homogeneous specific anthropomorphic mannequin (SAM) phantom is compared with a numerical heterogeneous phantom. The loss for the SAM phantom is found to be 30 dB lower than that for the heterogeneous phantom. It is shown that the absence of the pinna and the lossless shell in the SAM phantom underestimate the link loss. The effect of the pinnas is verified through measurements on a phantom where we have included the pinnas fabricated by 3-D printing.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2013.2283270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6675045/06607217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2283270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675045","startPage":"6180","endPage":"6190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Link Loss Model for the On-Body Propagation Channel for Binaural Hearing Aids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Link Loss Model for the On-Body Propagation Channel for Binaural Hearing Aids","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13934455","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6607217/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Link Loss Model for the On-Body Propagation Channel for Binaural Hearing Aids","sourcePdf":"tap-chandra-2283270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101247S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6675045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6675045","articleId":"6607217","onlineDate":"24 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6607237,"authors":[{"name":"Nuray At","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Anadolu University, Eski\u015fehir, Turkey"],"bio":{"p":["Nuray At received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Anadolu University, Eski\u015fehir, Turkey, the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Davis, CA, USA, in 1998, the M.Sc. degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Anadolu University, Eski\u015fehir, Turkey, in 2005.","She held a visiting researcher position at the Selmer Center, University of Bergen.

Maximum peak power tracking algorithms, which emphasize high renewable energy utilization, may cause a supply-demand imbalance when the available renewable generation is more than demanded, especially for autonomous microgrids. Currently, droop control is one of the most popular decentralized methods for sharing active and reactive loads among the distributed generators. However, conventional droop control methods suffer from slow and oscillating dynamic response and steady state deviations. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a distributed subgradient-based solution to coordinate the operations of different types of distributed renewable generators in a microgrid. By controlling the utilization levels of renewable generators, the supply-demand balance can be well maintained and the system dynamic performance can be significantly improved. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control solution.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2281038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6684613/06607249.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2281038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684613","startPage":"23","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Subgradient-Based Coordination of Multiple Renewable Generators in a Microgrid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Subgradient-Based Coordination of Multiple Renewable Generators in a Microgrid","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13973457","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6607249/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Subgradient-Based Coordination of Multiple Renewable Generators in a Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-liu-2281038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118993S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6684613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6684613","articleId":"6607249","onlineDate":"24 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6607250,"authors":[{"name":"Moon-Kyu Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Moon-Kyu","lastName":"Cho","id":"37085626256"},{"name":"Jeong-Geun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Geun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281191100"},{"name":"Donghyun Baek","affiliation":["Chung-Ang University, School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Donghyun","lastName":"Baek","id":"37325995200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6607250","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1185},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bidirectional control","Switches","Semiconductor device measurement","Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","distributed amplifiers","field effect MMIC","MMIC amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise figure","return losses","dc power consumption","active phased array antenna applications","cascode transistor switching method","multioctave operation bandwidth","CMOS technology","distributed amplifiers","wideband amplifiers","switchless bi-directional distributed gain amplifier","size 0.13 mum","noise figure 3.2 dB to 6.5 dB","frequency 3 GHz to 20 GHz","voltage 1.5 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS T/R chipset","octave bandwidth","phased array antenna","switchless bi-directional amplifier"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a wideband switchless bi-directional distributed amplifier in a commercial 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS technology, which realizes multi-octave bandwidth with high gain and low noise figure using distributed amplifier technique and cascode-amplifier pair.

High-speed operation is achieved by converting each sample with two alternate comparators clocked asynchronously and a redundant capacitive DAC with constant common mode to improve the accuracy of the comparator. A low-power, clocked capacitive reference buffer is used, and fractional reference voltages are provided to reduce the number of unit capacitors in the capacitive DAC (CDAC). The ADC stacks the CDAC with the reference capacitor to reduce the area and enhance the settling speed. Background calibration of comparator offset is implemented.

The developed approach is based on the solution of an optimization problem to maximize the profit of a generation agent along a planning period discretized in hourly steps using a Genetic Algorithm. This problem includes the possibility of pumping since this is an important resource in the scope of electricity markets. The scheduling problem was developed starting with an initial simplified version in which the head loss is neglected and the head is assumed constant. Then, it was implemented a second model in which the nonlinear relation between the head, the hydro power and the water discharge is retained and finally an approach in which the hydro schedule obtained in a given step is used to update the hourly electricity prices used to compute the profit of the generation agent. The short term hydro scheduling problem is illustrated using two Case Studies - the first one was designed to run a set of initial tests to the developed algorithm and the second one refers to a set of hydro stations that mirrors a cascade of 8 stations in Portugal.","doi":"10.1109/EEM.2013.6607278","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595168/6607268/06607278.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 10th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEM.2013.6607278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of the operation of hydro stations in market environment using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Scheduling","Genetic algorithms","Electricity supply industry","Computational modeling","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","hydroelectric power stations","power generation economics","power generation planning","power generation scheduling","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydro station operation optimization","market environment","genetic algorithms","short term operation planning","profit maximization","generation agent","genetic algorithm","electricity markets","scheduling problem","Portugal","short term hydro scheduling problem","electricity prices","water discharge","hydro power","nonlinear relation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["short-term hydro scheduling","pumping","day-ahead market","profit maximization","genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the operation of hydro stations in market environment using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607278/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"27-31 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13797597","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the operation of hydro stations in market environment using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"Contribution1111a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064924S","chronDate":"27-31 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595168","isNumber":"6607268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595168","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6607268","articleId":"6607278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6607433,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Qin","affiliation":["University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Qin","id":"38237754200"},{"name":"Christian R.

The proposed approach is based on an adaptation of the traditional Huffman algorithm, and it uses eight static tables to avoid the cost of the on-the-fly statistical analysis. The best table to encode a block is defined using a context evaluation, resulting in a context-adaptive configuration. The use of RFCAVLC reached an average compression rate higher than 31% for the evaluated video sequences. The architectures that implement the RFCAVLC encoder and decoder were designed and synthesized to an FPGA device. The RFCAVLC design is able to reach real-time encoding for WQSXGA (3200 \u00d7 2048 pixels) at 30 fps. The synthesis results show that this solution can be easily coupled to a complete video encoder system with negligible hardware overhead and without compromising the throughput for real-time high-definition multimedia applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607434.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A lossless approach for external memory bandwidth reduction in video coding systems and its VLSI architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Bandwidth","Decoding","Encoding","Streaming media","Video coding","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image sequences","statistical analysis","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossless approach","external memory bandwidth reduction","video coding systems","VLSI architecture","reference frame context adaptive variable-length coder","RFCAVLC","on-the-fly statistical analysis","context-adaptive configuration","video sequences","real-time encoding","real-time high-definition multimedia applications","FPGA device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video coding","motion estimation","memory bandwidth reduction","reference frame encoder","hardware design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"A lossless approach for external memory bandwidth reduction in video coding systems and its VLSI architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607434/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13799039","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A lossless approach for external memory bandwidth reduction in video coding systems and its VLSI architecture","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MainConferencepaper140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05589S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6607449,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen K.

For the unicast scenario, we propose a successive constrained eigenbeamforming (SCEB) technique to reduce the inter-user interference and enhance the data rates subject to power constraints. This scheme is further extended to a multicast scenario (SCEB-M) to maximize the sum rate of a user group with group constraints on the transmit power. We also derive optimal schemes to efficiently schedule a subset of users/ groups from the active user set. We employ a practical H.264 scalable video quality model to demonstrate the performance of the presented schemes in realistic video streaming broadband wireless networks. Simulation results show that the proposed SCEB schemes achieve a superior data rate and video quality in comparison to conventional resource allocation schemes in cooperative cellular scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative multi-cell beamforming for MIMO unicast/ multicast broadband H.264 scalable video networks","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607449","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607449.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607449","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative multi-cell beamforming for MIMO unicast/ multicast broadband H.264 scalable video networks","conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607449/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13811520","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative multi-cell beamforming for MIMO unicast/ multicast broadband H.264 scalable video networks","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MainConferencepaper197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.155567S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6607452,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-Ying Kuo","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tien-Ying Kuo","id":"37087065478"},{"name":"Yi-Chung Lo","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Chung Lo","id":"37087491781"},{"name":"Ssu-Neng Huang","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ssu-Neng Huang","id":"37087575939"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0015-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"6607452","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Forgery","Detectors","Cloning","Brightness","Robustness","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brightness","feature extraction","geometry","image coding","image forensics","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image forgery detection","region duplication tampering","automatic tampering detection algorithm","region duplication forgery detection","dual spare features","structure similarity","detection performance enhancement","local outlier detector","false positive detection","quantitative performance analysis","brightness distortion","geometric distortion","tampering generator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image forgery","region duplication","spare feature descriptor","local outlier detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607452","abstract":"This paper proposes an automatic tampering detection algorithm to detect the region duplication forgery on a digital image.

To tackle this problem, we propose a new no-reference image quality metric through combining two recently proposed reduced-reference IQA models, namely the free energy based distortion metric (FEDM) and the structural degradation model (SDM). In this work, it will be shown that there exists an approximate linear relationship between the original image information of the free energy feature and the structural degradation information. Based on this observation and the application of support vector machine (SVM) that is widely used in the current study of IQA, our newly developed No-reference Free energy and Structural degradation based Distortion Metric (NFSDM) is found to alleviate the dependance of original images, and has achieved remarkably well prediction accuracy, outperforming the most two full-reference IQA approaches PSNR/SSIM and several mainstream no-reference image quality metrics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607462.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"No-reference image quality assessment metric by combining free energy theory and structural degradation model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Transform coding","Abstracts","Degradation","Soil","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","image processing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["no-reference image quality assessment metric","free energy theory","structural degradation model","image information","reduced-reference IQA model","FEDM","SDM","approximate linear relationship","support vector machine","SVM","no-reference free energy and structural degradation based distortion metric","NFSDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image quality assessment (IQA)","no-reference (NR)","free energy","structural degradation","human visual system (HVS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"No-reference image quality assessment metric by combining free energy theory and structural degradation model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607462/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13799077","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"No-reference image quality assessment metric by combining free energy theory and structural degradation model","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MainConferencepaper229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156273S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6607468,"authors":[{"name":"Bob L.

One saliency detection method generates saliency maps for all the input images, so that we have a group of maps. Salient region of each image is extracted by its corresponding saliency map in the group. We use a matrix to combine all the salient regions. Ideally, these co-salient regions are similar and consistent, and therefore the matrix rank appears low. In this paper, we formalize this general consistency criterion as rankone constraint and propose a consistency energy to measure the approximation degree between matrix rank and one. We combine the single and multiple image saliency maps, and adaptively weight these maps under the rank-one constraint to generate the co-saliency map. Our method is valid for more than two input images and has more robustness than the existing co-saliency methods. Experimental results on benchmark database demonstrate that our method has the satisfactory performance on co-saliency detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607523","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607523.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency map fusion based on rank-one constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607523","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607523/","displayDocTitle":"Saliency map fusion based on rank-one constraint","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13799029","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607523/","conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency map fusion based on rank-one constraint","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MainConferencepaper444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093307S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6607546,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Anguera","affiliation":["Telefonica Research, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Anguera","id":"37550606100"},{"name":"Miquel Ferrarons","affiliation":["Telefonica Research, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Miquel","lastName":"Ferrarons","id":"37075007200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0015-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"6607546","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Memory management","Acoustics","Speech","Databases","Dynamic programming","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio databases","Internet","query processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory efficient subsequence DTW","query-by-example spoken term detection","MES-DTW","spoken queries","spoken documents","fixed start-end points","optimal matching subsequences","search collection","QbE-STD","large scale database querying","speech detection","nonspeech detection","Mediaeval 2012 spoken-Web-search dataset","dynamic time warping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Time Warping","pattern matching","dynamic programming","speech"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607546","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607546.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory efficient subsequence DTW for Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection","abstract":"In this paper we propose a fast and memory efficient Dynamic Time Warping (MES-DTW) algorithm for the task of Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection (QbE-STD).

This paper presents an extensive analytical and statistical comparison of several different subsampling patterns using analysis of variance. The investigation includes commonly used patterns as well as seven proposed ones. The experiments were conducted on 19 video samples in a range of five resolutions (being nine videos at 1080p) and 30 bitrates by using the state-of-the-art x264 encoder running successive elimination exhaustive search. Two objective quality metrics were reported, PSNR and DSSIM, resulting in 10680 experimental points. The analysis of such amount of data allowed us to conclude that the proposed 4:3 ratio shows less than 5% in DSSIM and 1% in PSNR losses, being more than two times faster than full sampling. Compared with higher decimation, it presents a better trade-off between speedup and quality loss.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607555","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607555.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality assessment of subsampling patterns for pel decimation targeting high definition video","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Quality assessment of subsampling patterns for pel decimation targeting high definition video","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6607555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13798996","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607555/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality assessment of subsampling patterns for pel decimation targeting high definition video","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MainConferencepaper559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085514S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6607560,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Li","id":"37714130800"},{"name":"Dan Schonfeld","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Schonfeld","id":"37294984500"},{"name":"Shmuel Friedland","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Statistics & Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shmuel","lastName":"Friedland","id":"37284209300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0015-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"6607560","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":807},"abstract":"Compressive sensing (CS) has triggered enormous research activity since its first appearance. CS exploits the signal's sparseness or compressibility in a particular domain and integrates data compression and acquisition. While conventional CS theory relies on data representation in the form of vectors, many data types in various applications such as color imaging, video sequences, and multi-sensor networks, are intrinsically represented by higher-order tensors. Application of CS to higher-order data representation is typically performed by conversion of the data to very long vectors that must be measured using very large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational and memory burden. In this paper, we propose Generalized Tensor Compressive Sensing (GTCS)- a unified framework for compressive sensing of higher-order tensors. GTCS offers an efficient means for representation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition and compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed method with Kronecker compressive sensing (KCS). We demonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS in terms of both accuracy and speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607560.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized tensor compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Compressed sensing","Vectors","Image reconstruction","PSNR","Sparse matrices","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data compression","matrix algebra","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized tensor compressive sensing","CS","data compression","data acquisition","higher-order data representation","very large sampling matrices","GTCS","multidimensional data","Kronecker compressive sensing","KCS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","convex optimization","multilinear algebra","higher-order tensor","generalized tensor compressive sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Generalized tensor compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607560/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13798978","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized tensor compressive sensing","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MainConferencepaper579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096954S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6607561,"authors":[{"name":"Dah-Chung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Dah-Chung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37290177600"},{"name":"Fei-Tao Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fei-Tao","lastName":"Chu","id":"37074837700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0015-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"6607561","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active noise cancellation with a new variable tap length and step size FXLMS algorithm","abstract":"The filtered-X least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm is widely used for active noise cancellation (ANC). Some variants of FxLMS algorithms have been studied to reduce computational complexity or to improve convergence rate. In general applications, a long tap length is usually required for the conventional FxLMS method which convergence rate is very slow though its structure is possibly very easy to implement. In this paper, a new ANC system is proposed with a variable tap length and step size FxLMS algorithm. Taking into account the effect of the lowpass filter in the secondary path of an ANC system, the impulse response of the control filter is modeled with a two-sided exponential decay envelope to develop our algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm does provide a significant performance improvement on convergence rate and noise reduction ratio compared to the fixed tap FxLMS and previously proposed variable step size FxLMS algorithms.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607561.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607561","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607561","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607561","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Adaptation models","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active noise control","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtered-X least mean square","active noise cancellation","ANC","computational complexity","convergence rate","variable tap length","variable step size FxLMS algorithm","lowpass filter","impulse response","two-sided exponential decay envelope","noise reduction ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FxLMS","active noise cancellation","LMS","secondary path","exponential decay envelope","noise reduction ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607561/","displayDocTitle":"Active noise cancellation with a new variable tap length and step size FXLMS algorithm","accessionNumber":"13798949","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6607561/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active noise cancellation with a new variable tap length and step size FXLMS algorithm","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MainConferencepaper58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060322S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6607562,"authors":[{"name":"Avram Levi","affiliation":["Avaya Laboratories, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Avram","lastName":"Levi","id":"37074995700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0015-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"6607562","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Abstracts","Equations","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","direction-of-arrival estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","Gaussian processes","microphones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PDOA based underdetermined blind source separation","frequency bin-wise separation","mixed speech signals","Gaussian mixture model fitting","expectation-maximization algorithm","phase-difference-of-arrival","microphones"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BSS","underdetermined","time-frequency masking"]}],"abstract":"This paper builds on the idea of frequency bin-wise separation of mixed speech signals by Gaussian Mixture Model fitting using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm on Phase-Difference-of-Arrival values between two microphones.

To address this issue, we have previously proposed cloud centric media network (CCMN) for cost-efficient UGCs delivery. In this paper, we further study the content placement problem in CCMN. Our objective is to minimize the monetary cost incurred by using cloud resources to orchestrate an elastic and global content delivery network (CDN) service. In particular, this objective is achieved via a two-step method. First, for a single content, we map it into a k-center problem, and find a logarithmic relationship between the mean hop distance from users to contents, and the reciprocal of replica number. Second, for multiple contents, we formulate a convex optimization with storage and bandwidth capacity constraints, which can be solved by our proposed algorithm. Finally, we verify the algorithm based on real-world traces collected from a popular video website in China. Our numerical results suggest that, the optimal number of replica for each content follows a power law in respect to its popularity, under feasible storage and bandwidth constraints, in a set of deployed backbone networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607582.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward monetary cost effective content placement in cloud centric media network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Network topology","Upper bound","Convex functions","Topology","Optimization","Vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","convex programming","cost reduction","storage management","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monetary cost effective content placement","cloud centric media network","user-generated contents","efficient UGC delivery","CCMN","monetary cost minimization","cloud resources","global content delivery network service","CDN","logarithmic relationship","k-center problem","mean hop distance","replica number","storage capacity constraints","bandwidth capacity constraints","convex optimization","video Web site"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Toward monetary cost effective content placement in cloud centric media network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607582/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13799109","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward monetary cost effective content placement in cloud centric media network","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MainConferencepaper719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.177788S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6607634,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester, USA"],"lastName":"Yao Zhou","id":"37087574397"},{"name":"Jiebo Luo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester, USA"],"lastName":"Jiebo Luo","id":"37087298814"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0015-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"6607634","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Feature extraction","Strips","Table lookup","Birds","Cameras","Density functional theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden feature removal","image motion analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","pedestrians","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary target object counting","arbitrary scenes","microscopic image","pedestrians","surveillance video","object modeling","object detection","mutual occlusion","supervised learning framework","object density","image region","motion flow","birds data sets","humanity benefitting applications","urban planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Counting","learning framework","area of interest","perspective effect"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607634","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2013.6607634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2013.6607634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607419","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596168/6607419/06607634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical method for counting arbitrary target objects in arbitrary scenes","abstract":"Counting objects such as estimating the number of cells in a microscopic image or the number of pedestrians in a surveillance video is usually accomplished using a counting by detection approach. However, such approaches require explicit object modeling and object detection, and thus often run into problems in the presence of mutual occlusion between objects in the scene. We extend a supervised learning framework that bypasses the challenges in object detection and instead focuses on estimating an object density whose integral over an image region quickly yields the count of objects. Our extensions make it practical for arbitrary objects and scenes. In particular, we automatically determine the area of interest through the motion flow of the objects in the scene, and compensate for perspective effect when it is sensed to be present. Extensive experiments using cells, crowds, traffic, and birds data sets have shown the robustness of the method for a wide range of humanity benefitting applications including security, transportation, biomedicine, ecology, environment, and urban planning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6607634/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13799046","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A practical method for counting arbitrary target objects in arbitrary scenes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical method for counting arbitrary target objects in arbitrary scenes","confLoc":"San Jose, CA","sourcePdf":"PosterSessionspaper899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06014S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596168","isNumber":"6607419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596168","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6607419","articleId":"6607634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6607825,"authors":[{"name":"Hidekazu Yanagimoto","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidekazu","lastName":"Yanagimoto","id":"37394326500"},{"name":"Mika Shimada","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Mika","lastName":"Shimada","id":"37075255300"},{"name":"Akane Yoshimura","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Akane","lastName":"Yoshimura","id":"37075018700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0174-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6607825","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":618},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607825","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Natural language processing","Feature extraction","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document handling","feature extraction","natural language processing","neural nets","pattern classification","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document similarity estimation","sentiment analysis","deep architecture neural network","document classification","natural language processing","bag-of-words model","feature extraction","term occurrence frequency based value","term weight methodologies","feature vectors","data distribution","deep learning","language model","stock market news similarity estimation","sentiment polarity","unsupervised learning approach"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607825","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588696/6607797/06607825.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Document similarity estimation for sentiment analysis using neural network","abstract":"It is important to classify documents according to their contents because of finding necessary documents efficiently. To achieve good classification document similarity estimation is one of key techniques since classification is executed based on the document similarity. In natural language processing bag-of-words model is used to extract features from documents and term occurrence frequency based value is used as a weight of each features. However, the term weight methodologies usually use predefined models and include some limitations. New approaches to construct feature vectors based on data distribution are desired to achieve high performance of natural language processing. These days many researchers pay attention to deep learning. Deep learning is a new approach to transform raw data to feature vectors using many unlabeled data. This characteristics is desirable to satisfy a previous need. In natural language processing a main aim is to construct a language model on a deep architecture neural network. In this paper we use a deep architecture neural network to estimate document similarity. To obtain good article similarity estimation we have to generate good article vectors that can represent all article characteristics. Hence, we use many stock market news to train the deep architecture neural network and generate article vectors with the trained neural network. And we calculate cosine similarity between labeled articles and discuss performance of the deep architecture neural network. In evaluation we do not focus on articles' contents but on their sentiment polarity. Hence, we discuss whether the proposed method classifies articles according to their sentiment polarity or not. We confirmed though the proposed method is an unsupervised learning approach, it achieves good performance in stock market news similarity estimation. The results show a deep architecture neural network can be applied to more natural language processing tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607825/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13797162","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6607825/","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"16-20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Document similarity estimation for sentiment analysis using neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Document similarity estimation for sentiment analysis using neural network","confLoc":"Niigata, Japan","sourcePdf":"127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049565S","chronDate":"16-20 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588696","isNumber":"6607797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588696","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6607797","articleId":"6607825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6607855,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Amirjavid","affiliation":["Department of mathematics and Computer science, UQAC, Chicoutimi, Canada"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Amirjavid","id":"37586504200"},{"name":"Abdenour Bouzouane","affiliation":["Department of mathematics and Computer science, UQAC, Chicoutimi, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdenour","lastName":"Bouzouane","id":"37550483200"},{"name":"Bruno Bouchard","affiliation":["Department of mathematics and Computer science, UQAC, Chicoutimi, Canada"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Bouchard","id":"37828020500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0174-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6607855","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Smart homes","Temperature sensors","Intelligent sensors","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven conceptual structures","simultaneous activities","fuzzy events","intelligent system","intelligence source","fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["activity recognition","fuzzy logic","temporal data mining"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607855","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607797","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588696/6607797/06607855.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data driven conceptual structures for simultaneous activities","abstract":"An activity is a chain of fuzzy events that occur in an environment caused by an intelligent system in order to achieve a goal.

Reliability is a key metric for assessing performance in such systems. Redundancy and diversity are prevalent approaches to enhance reliability in Cloud Computing Systems (CCS). Proper resource allocation is an alternative approach to reliability improvement in such systems. In contrast to redundancy, appropriate resource allocation can improve system reliability without imposing extra cost. On the other hand, contemplating reliability irrespective of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements may be undesirable in most of CCSs. In this paper, we focus on resource allocation approach and introduce an analytical model in order to analyze system reliability besides considering application and resource constraints. Task precedence structure and QoS are taken into account as the application constraints. Memory and storage limitation of each server as well as maximum communication load on each link are considered as the principle resource constraints. In addition, effect of network topology on system reliability is discussed in detail and the model is extended to cover various network topologies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Program processors","Quality of service","Resource management","Software reliability","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer network reliability","network servers","next generation networks","quality of service","redundancy","resource allocation","storage management","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing systems","QoS requirements","next generation systems","key metric reliability","resource allocation","quality of service requirements","CCS","resource constraints","task precedence structure","communication load","network topology","system reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing system","reliability","analytical model","resource allocation","quality of service"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607860","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607860","startPage":"315","endPage":"321","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588696/6607797/06607860.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607860/","displayDocTitle":"An analytical model to evaluate reliability of cloud computing systems in the presence of QoS requirements","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 June 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13797164","htmlLink":"/document/6607860/","conferenceDate":"16-20 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical model to evaluate reliability of cloud computing systems in the presence of QoS requirements","confLoc":"Niigata, Japan","sourcePdf":"162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066508S","chronDate":"16-20 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588696","isNumber":"6607797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588696","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6607797","articleId":"6607860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6607881,"authors":[{"name":"Juntao Fei","affiliation":["College of Computer and information, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Juntao","lastName":"Fei","id":"37407861600"},{"name":"Yuzheng Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer and information, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuzheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37965295000"},{"name":"Dan Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer and information, Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37075100500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0174-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6607881","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Gyroscopes","Micromechanical devices","Robustness","Upper bound","Adaptation models","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","gyroscopes","Lyapunov methods","micromechanical devices","neurocontrollers","numerical analysis","radial basis function networks","robust control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust RBF neural network control","numerical simulations","closed loop system stability","Lyapunov framework","RNSM control system","robust compensator design","adaptive controller","RNSM tracking control scheme","microelectromechanical system","MEMS Z-axis gyroscope","adaptive sliding mode compensator","radial basis function neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robust control","neural network","bound estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607881","abstract":"A new robust neural sliding mode(RNSM) tracking control scheme using radial basis function(RBF) neural network (NN) is presented for MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical systems) Z-axis gyroscope to achieve robustness and asymptotic tracking error convergence.

Moreover, another RBF NN is employed to learn the upper bound of NN modeling error and external disturbances, so the prior knowledge of the upper bound of system uncertainties is not required.

Numerical simulations for a MEMS gyroscope are investigated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed RNSM tracking control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607881","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588696/6607797/06607881.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"454","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6607797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust RBF neural network control with adaptive sliding mode compensator for MEMS gyroscope","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6607881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust RBF neural network control with adaptive sliding mode compensator for MEMS gyroscope","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13797169","publicationDate":"June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6607881/","conferenceDate":"16-20 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust RBF neural network control with adaptive sliding mode compensator for MEMS gyroscope","confLoc":"Niigata, Japan","sourcePdf":"183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04953S","chronDate":"16-20 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588696","isNumber":"6607797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588696","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6607797","articleId":"6607881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6607890,"authors":[{"name":"Jinlei Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jinlei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406673400"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37350692600"},{"name":"Ruiyi Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Ruiyi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37075112700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0174-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6607890","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Approximation algorithms","Decoding","Bit error rate","Simulation","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved normalized min-sum algorithm","low-density parity-check codes","decoding","LDPC codes","check node computing","BP algorithm","IN-MS algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","LDPC decoding","normalized min-sum algorithm"]}],"abstract":"An improved normalized min-sum (IN-MS) algorithm is proposed for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

Previous studies concluded that the regions in the vicinity of the human eye - the periocular region- have surprisingly high discriminating ability between individuals, are relatively permanent and easily acquired at large distances. Hence, growing attention has been paid to periocular recognition methods, on the performance levels they are able to achieve, and on the correlation of the responses given by other. This work overviews the most relevant research works in the scope of periocular recognition: summarizes the developed methods, and enumerates the current issues, providing a comparative overview.

This is motivated mainly by the relative simple implementation of the OFDM system and its capability to transmit efficiently over long time spread channels. This paper describes the modem developed in the context of COMET project, which aims to produce low cost Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) designed to move in an UWA network. This easy configuring software modem is based on a new pulse-shaped OFDM scheme, using the square root raised cosine (RRC) function defined in time domain at both the transmitter and the receiver sides. In addition to its reduced energy consumption, the proposed modem optimizes the spectral efficiency, while neither pilots nor null subcarriers are required with the DPSK modulation use. Flexible and primed to operate with various channel characteristics, it has three different running modes: the standby mode, the locking mode and the decoding mode. To date, the modem is implemented in Matlab language and is real-time running. After the modem presentation in terms of designing modules, we provide supporting results from experiments conducted during sea trials.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 MTS/IEEE OCEANS - Bergen","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596167/6607940/06608003.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 MTS/IEEE OCEANS -

An adaptive controller for dynamic positioning of a remotely vehicle (ROV) with unknown parameters and disturbances is addressed in this paper. The additional forces caused by the umbilical cables and ocean currents can be estimated and compensated. An RBF neural network compensator is proposed to deal with the dynamic uncertain nonlinear mapping and cross coupling terms, because the dynamics of ROV are highly nonlinear nature and the hydrodynamic coefficients are difficult to be accurately estimated. The adaptation Laws and network weights adaptation law are derived from the Lyapunov stability analysis, and the stability of close-loop system is proved.

The prior probability map over the exploration area is built through Gaussian kernel approximation, on the basis of previous findings and historical archival data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 June 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6608110/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13798833","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative distributed algorithm for AUV teams: A minimum entropy approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative distributed algorithm for AUV teams: A minimum entropy approach","confLoc":"Bergen, Norway","sourcePdf":"130118116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056511S","chronDate":"10-14 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596167","isNumber":"6607940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596167","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6607940","articleId":"6608110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6608114,"authors":[{"name":"Bahattin Karakaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Bahattin","lastName":"Karakaya","id":"37847036800"},{"name":"Mazen Omar Hasna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mazen Omar","lastName":"Hasna","id":"37273431400"},{"name":"Tolga M.

The combiner weights are computed recursively across carriers, using a stochastic gradient algorithm. The information contained in the combiner weights is also used to predict the Doppler shifts for the next incoming block, thus enhancing the accuracy of adaptive channel tracking.

The acoustic path between a surface vessel and an underwater vehicle, for example, can experience Mach numbers of one percent and more which can be catastrophic if not compensated dynamically. In this paper, we derive a sample-by-sample, recursive resampling technique, in which time-varying Doppler is explicitly modeled, tracked and compensated. Integrated into an iterative turbo equalization based receiver, this novel Doppler compensation technique achieves unprecedented communication performance in field tests and simulations. Our field data stems from the MACE10 experiment conducted in the shallow waters 100 km south of Martha's Vineyard, MA. Under challenging conditions (harsh multi-path, ranges up to 7.2 km, SNRs down to 2 dB and relative speeds up to 3 knots) our receiver achieved a raw data rate of over 39 kbits/s and a perfectly reliable net data rate of over 23 kbits/s (taking into account the overhead from equalizer training and channel coding) in less than 10 kHz of bandwidth. To illustrate the robustness of this approach to high rates of Doppler, a variety of simulations are also provided. We demonstrate that the performance of our algorithm does not depend on the absolute level of Doppler, but only on the rate of its variation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 June 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6608187/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13811510","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"MUST-READ: Multichannel sample-by-sample turbo resampling equalization and decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MUST-READ: Multichannel sample-by-sample turbo resampling equalization and decoding","confLoc":"Bergen, Norway","sourcePdf":"130128002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052948S","chronDate":"10-14 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596167","isNumber":"6607940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596167","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6607940","articleId":"6608187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6608188,"authors":[{"name":"Gilles Gaonach","affiliation":["General Sonar Studies, Thales Underwater Systems, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Gaonach","id":"37075348400"},{"name":"Marie Gehant","affiliation":["General Sonar Studies, Thales Underwater Systems, France"],"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Gehant","id":"37075301400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0001-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0000-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608188","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Array signal processing","Noise","Sensor arrays","Artificial neural networks","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive subarrays beamforming","rank reduction prior","two-steps beamforming","two basic partitions schemes","linear array","interlaced sensors","anti-jamming","noise rejection","directivity index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["beamforming","subarrays","adaptive"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608188","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Bergen.2013.6608188","publicationTitle":"2013 MTS/IEEE OCEANS - Bergen","abstract":"Rank reduction prior to adaptive beamforming is required for large arrays in order to reduce the required number of samples.

Although the concept of multi-start local search is not new in the optimization environment the proposed algorithm is shown to be extremely efficient on a broad set of diverse problems and competitive with complex algorithms representing the-state-of-the-art in computational intelligence optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6608207/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13798030","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Re-sampling search: A seriously simple memetic approach with a high performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Re-sampling search: A seriously simple memetic approach with a high performance","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP08SS0316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083386S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596004","isNumber":"6608198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596004","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6608198","articleId":"6608207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6608209,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The gains from massive MIMO communication come from the use of multiuser MIMO on the uplink and downlink, but with a large excess of antennas at the base station compared to the number of served users. Initial work on massive MIMO did not fully address several practical issues associated with its deployment. This paper considers the impact of channel aging on the performance of massive MIMO systems. The effects of channel variation are characterized as a function of different system parameters assuming a simple model for the channel time variations at the transmitter. Channel prediction is proposed to overcome channel aging effects. The analytical results on aging show how capacity is lost due to time variation in the channel. Numerical results in a multiceli network show that massive MIMO works even with some channel variation and that channel prediction could partially overcome channel aging effects.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2013.000065","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6608212/06608213.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2013.000065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of channel aging in massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Effects of channel aging in massive MIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608213/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13822908","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608213/","volume":"15","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of channel aging in massive MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086112S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6608212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"6608212","articleId":"6608213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"KICS","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":6608214,"authors":[{"name":"Riichi Kudo","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Yokosuka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6608212/6608214/6608214-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Riichi Kudo received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Geophysics from Tohoku University, Japan in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

The effectiveness of Massive MIMO-OFDM is strongly affected by the channel state information (CSI) estimation method used. The overheads of training frame transmission and CSI feedback decrease multiple access channel (MAC) efficiency and increase the CSI estimation cost at a user station (STA). This paper proposes a CSI estimation scheme that reduces the training frame length by using a novel pilot design and a novel unitary matrix feedback method. The proposed pilot design and unitary matrix feedback enable the access point (AP) to estimate the CSI of the signal space of all transmit antennas using a small number of training frames. Simulations in an IEEE 802.11n channel verify the attractive transmission performance of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6608212/06608214.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2013.000066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2013.000066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608212","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A channel state information feedback method for massive MIMO-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Vectors","MIMO","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Channel estimation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel state information feedback method","massive MIMO-OFDM","multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmit antennas signal space","transmit antennas massive number","transmission energy per bit reduction","channel state information estimation method","CSI estimation method","multiple access channel efficiency","MAC efficiency","user station","STA","pilot design","unitary matrix feedback","access point","IEEE 802.11n channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel state information (CSI) estimation","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","MIMO-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM)","multiuser MIMO","wireless loca area network (LAN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A channel state information feedback method for massive MIMO-OFDM","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6608214/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13822905","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A channel state information feedback method for massive MIMO-OFDM","sourcePdf":"352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075534S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6608212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6608212","articleId":"6608214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"KICS","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6608215,"authors":[{"name":"Minchae Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6608212/6608215/6608215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minchae Jung was born in Seoul, Korea in 1985.

By utilizing deterministic ergodic sum rates for the ZF-beamforming (ZF-BF) and ZF-receiver (ZF-R) with a large number of BS antennas [1], [2], we can obtain the ergodic sum throughputs for the ZF-BF and ZF-R for the uplink and downlink frame structures, respectively. Then, we can also formulate and solve the optimization problems maximizing the ergodic sum throughputs with respect to the number of users. This paper shows that the approximate downlink sum throughput for the ZF-BF is a concave function and the approximate uplink sum throughput for the ZF-R is also a concave function in a feasible range with respect to the number of users. The simulation results verify the analyses and show that the derived numbersof users provide the maximum sum throughputs for the ZF-BF as well as ZF-R in multiuser MIMO systems with a large number of BS antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6608212/06608215.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"369","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2013.000067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2013.000067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608212","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal number of users in zero-forcing based multiuser MIMO systems with large number of antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Downlink","Throughput","MIMO","Antennas","OFDM","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","array signal processing","MIMO communication","optimisation","radio links","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO system","zero-forcing beamforming","multiple-input multiple-output system","base station antenna","BS antenna","deterministic ergodic sum rate","ZF-BF","ZF-receiver","ZF-R","downlink frame structure","optimization problem","approximate downlink sum throughput","concave function","approximate uplink sum throughput","maximum sum throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large number of antennas","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multiuser","zero-forcing beamforming (ZF-BF)","zero-forcing receiver (ZF-R)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal number of users in zero-forcing based multiuser MIMO systems with large number of antennas","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6608215/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13822906","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal number of users in zero-forcing based multiuser MIMO systems with large number of antennas","sourcePdf":"362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072126S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6608212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6608212","articleId":"6608215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"KICS","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6608216,"authors":[{"name":"Haoming Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6608212/6608216/6608216-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haoming Li [S'08] is a Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineering at the University of British Columbia.

In this case the channel gain matrix H can be modeled as a multi-banded matrix, in which off-diagonal entries decay both exponentially due to heavy human penetration loss and polynomially due to free space propagation loss. To enable practical implementation of such systems, we present a multi-banded matrix inversion algorithm that substantially reduces the complexity of ZFBF by keeping the most significant entries in H and the preceding matrix W. We introduce a parameter p to control the sparsity of H and W and thus achieve the tradeoff between the computational complexity and the system throughput. The proposed algorithm includes dense and sparse preceding versions, providing quadratic and linear complexity, respectively, relative to the number of antennas. We present analysis and numerical evaluations to show that the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) increases linearly with p in dense precoding. In sparse preceding, we demonstrate the necessity of using directional antennas by both analysis and simulations. When the directional antenna gain increases, the resulting SIR increment in sparse precoding increases linearly with p, while the SIR of dense precoding is much less sensitive to changes in p.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity zero-forcing beamforming for distributed massive MIMO systems in large public venues","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2013.000068","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6608212/06608216.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2013.000068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608212","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity zero-forcing beamforming for distributed massive MIMO systems in large public venues","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6608216/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13822911","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity zero-forcing beamforming for distributed massive MIMO systems in large public venues","sourcePdf":"370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099731S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6608212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6608212","articleId":"6608216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6608217,"authors":[{"name":"Aki Hakkarainen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6608212/6608217/6608217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aki Hakkarainen was born in Joensuu, Finland in 1982.

The analysis shows that massive antenna arrays are increasingly sensitive to such RF chain imperfections, corrupting heavily the radiation pattern and beamforming capabilities. Motivated by this, novel RF-aware digital beamforming methods are then developed for automatically suppressing the unwanted effects of the RF I/Q imbalance without separate calibration loops in all individual receiver branches. More specifically, the paper covers closed-form analysis for signal processing properties as well as the associated radiation and beamforming properties of massive antenna arrays under both systematic and random RF I/Q imbalances. All analysis and derivations in this paper assume ideal signals to be circular. The well-known minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer and a widely-linear (WL) extension of it, called WL-MVDR, are analyzed in detail from the RF imperfection perspective, in terms of interference attenuation and beamsteering. The optimum RF-aware WL-MVDR beamforming solution is formulated and shown to efficiently suppress the RF imperfections. Based on the obtained results, the developed solutions and in particular the RF-aware WL-MVDR method can provide efficient beamsteering and interference suppressing characteristics, despite of the imperfections in the RF circuits. This is seen critical especially in the massive antenna array context where the cost-efficiency of individual RF chains is emphasized.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2013.000069","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6608212/06608217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2013.000069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608212","startPage":"383","endPage":"397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Widely-linear beamforming and RF impairment suppression in massive antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","displayDocTitle":"Widely-linear beamforming and RF impairment suppression in massive antenna arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13822910","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6608217/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Widely-linear beamforming and RF impairment suppression in massive antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074222S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6608212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6608212","articleId":"6608217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"KICS","_value":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6608218,"authors":[{"name":"Sangkyu Park","affiliation":["School of EECS, INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6608212/6608218/6608218-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sangkyu Park received B.S degree in Electrical Engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea in 2009.

They have many potential applications in both wired and wireless communications. Most existing digital fountain codes operate over binary fields using an iterative belief-propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new iterative decoding algorithm for both binary and nonbinary fields. The basic form of our proposed algorithm considers both degree-1 and degree-2 check nodes (instead of only degree-1 check nodes as in the original BP decoding scheme), and has linear complexity. Extensive simulation demonstrates that it outperforms the original BP decoding scheme, especially for a small number of source packets. The enhanced form of the proposed algorithm combines the basic form of the algorithm and a guess-based algorithm to further improve the decoding performance. Simulation results demonstrate that it can provide better decoding performance than the guess-based algorithm with fewer guesses, and can achieve decoding performance close to that of the maximum likelihood decoder at a much lower decoding complexity. Last, we show that our nonbinary scheme has the potential to outperform the binary scheme when choosing suitable degree distributions, and furthermore it is insensitive to the size of the Galois field.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2013.000072","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6608212/06608220.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"421","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2013.000072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new iterative LT decoding algorithm for binary and nonbinary Galois fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A new iterative LT decoding algorithm for binary and nonbinary Galois fields","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6608220/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13822909","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new iterative LT decoding algorithm for binary and nonbinary Galois fields","sourcePdf":"411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107213S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6608212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6608212","articleId":"6608220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"KICS","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6608229,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas L.

A potential technology for meeting this demand is Massive MIMO (also called Large-Scale Antenna Systems, Large-Scale MIMO, ARGOS, Full-Dimension MIMO, or Hyper-MIMO), a form of multiuser multipleantenna wireless which promises orders-of-magnitude improvements in spectral-efficiency over 4G technology, and accompanying improvements in radiated energy-efficiency. The distinguishing feature of Massive MIMO is that a large number of service-antennas - possibly hundreds or even thousands - work for a significantly smaller number of active autonomous terminals. Upsetting the traditional parity between service antennas and terminals in this manner is a game-changer: The simplest multiplexing precoding and decoding algorithms can be nearly optimal, expensive ultra-linear forty-Watt power amplifiers are replaced by many low-power units, and the favorable action of the law of large numbers can greatly facilitate power-control and resource-allocation.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2013.000064","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6608212/06608229.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2013.000064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Special issue on Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608229/","displayDocTitle":"Special issue on Massive MIMO","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608229/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Special issue on Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"editorial333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029398S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6608212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6608212","articleId":"6608229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"KICS","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6608283,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro L.

Optimization plays an important role in these areas. The optimization problems arising in Granular Computing area are called granular optimization problems in which information granules are treated as information processing units and therefore granules denote the related solutions. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been demonstrated to be a very competitive algorithm in solving global optimization problems. In this paper, we develop a novel PSO variant called granular PSO to solve problems of granular optimization. Each granule in this study is expressed as a multi-dimension hyper-box with each coordinate being described by an interval. In the proposed granular PSO, the velocity and position of a particle is represented by intervals rather than single numerical values. The velocity and position update strategy is modified accordingly. In granular PSO, the solution space search behavior of a particle is realized in granule-to-granule manner rather than point-to-point format. We provide experimental simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed granular PSO algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608369","startPage":"24","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"2013 Joint IFSA World Congress and NAFIPS Annual Meeting (IFSA/NAFIPS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608358","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Joint IFSA World Congress and NAFIPS Annual Meeting (IFSA/NAFIPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596206/6608358/06608369.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new granular particle swarm optimization variant for Granular optimization problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608369/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new granular particle swarm optimization variant for Granular optimization problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608369/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13799560","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new granular particle swarm optimization variant for Granular optimization problems","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079833S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596206","isNumber":"6608358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596206","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6608358","articleId":"6608369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6608375,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald R.

distribution feeders configuration for active power losses minimization by genetic algorithms","abstract":"In this paper we face the problem of the joint optimization of both topology and network parameters in order to minimize the total active power losses in a real Smart Grid. It is considered a portion of the Italian electric distribution network managed by the ACEA Distribuzione S.p.A. located in Rome which presents back-flows of active power for 20% of the annual operative time. It includes about 1200 user loads, 70 km of MV lines, 6 feeders, a thyristor voltage regulator (TVR) and 6 distributed energy sources (5 generator sets and 1 photovoltaic plant). Network topology can be changed by 106 breakers. The grid has been accurately modelled and simulated in the phasor domain by Matlab/Simulink, relying on the SimPowerSystems ToolBox, following a Multi-Level Hierarchical and Modular approach. Network optimization is faced by defining and solving a suited multi-objective optimization problem, considering suited constraints on nominal operative ranges on voltages and currents, as well as on generator's capability functions, in order to take into account safety and quality of service issues. To this aim it is adopted a genetic algorithm, defining a suited fitness function. Tests have been performed by feeding the simulation environment with real data concerning dissipated and generated active and reactive power values. First results are very interesting, showing that relying on evolutionary computation it is possible to yield a satisfactory power factor correction, confirming that the proposed optimization technique can be adopted as the core of a hierarchical Smart Grid control system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608435/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13811666","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608435/","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal distribution feeders configuration for active power losses minimization by genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal distribution feeders configuration for active power losses minimization by genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059267S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596206","isNumber":"6608358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596206","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6608358","articleId":"6608435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6608437,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico De Santis","affiliation":["Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications Department, University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"De Santis","id":"37075045800"},{"name":"Antonello Rizzi","affiliation":["Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications Department, University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonello","lastName":"Rizzi","id":"37273999700"},{"name":"Alireza Sadeghiany","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ryerson University, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Sadeghiany","id":"37075387300"},{"name":"Fabio Massimo Frattale Mascioli","affiliation":["Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications Department, University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio Massimo Frattale","lastName":"Mascioli","id":"37543223700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0348-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608437","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608437","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Optimization","Batteries","Fuzzy logic","Decision making","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand side management","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","power grids","power system economics","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic optimization","fuzzy control system","energy flow management","microgrids","computational intelligence techniques","power demand side optimization","flow management optimization","fuzzy logic controller","FLC","time-of use cost management program","energy storage capacity","lithium ion batteries","hybrid fuzzy-GA paradigm","genetic algorithm","real time prices","energy trade"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608358","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Joint IFSA World Congress and NAFIPS Annual Meeting (IFSA/NAFIPS)","publicationTitle":"2013 Joint IFSA World Congress and NAFIPS Annual Meeting (IFSA/NAFIPS)","doi":"10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic optimization of a fuzzy control system for energy flow management in micro-grids","startPage":"418","endPage":"423","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596206/6608358/06608437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608437","abstract":"In this paper we present an interesting application of Computational Intelligence techniques for the power demand side and flow management optimization in a microgrid.

This approach is largely motivated by alleged disadvantages of rule-based system architectures that still dominate the field. Due to its hierarchical, modular structure and the use of different types of (nonlinear) aggregation operators, a fuzzy pattern tree has the ability to represent functional dependencies in a more flexible and more compact way, thereby offering a reasonable balance between accuracy and model transparency. We evaluate this new model class in the context of a concrete case study, namely the modeling of color yield in polyester high temperature dyeing as a function of disperse dyes concentration, temperature and time. To this end, we compare three possibilities for model construction: purely knowledge-driven, purely data-driven and a hybrid approach combining these two. Our results show that, in comparison to conventional fuzzy modeling using Mamdani rules, fuzzy pattern trees are not only more accurate but also more compact and therefore more easily interpretable, regardless of whether the models are constructed in a knowledge-driven, data-driven or hybrid manner. Moreover, we show that a hybrid modeling approach can outperform a purely data-driven and a purely knowledge-driven approach if expert knowledge and model calibration are combined in a suitable way.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Image color analysis","Fuzzy systems","Color","Fuzzy sets","Chromatic dispersion","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dyeing","expert systems","fuzzy set theory","fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy pattern trees","rule-based fuzzy system","knowledge-driven modeling","data-driven modeling","hybrid modeling","fuzzy system modeling","modular structure","functional dependencies","model transparency","polyester high temperature dyeing","disperse dyes concentration","Mamdani rules","expert knowledge","model calibration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608488","publicationTitle":"2013 Joint IFSA World Congress and NAFIPS Annual Meeting (IFSA/NAFIPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Joint IFSA World Congress and NAFIPS Annual Meeting (IFSA/NAFIPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596206/6608358/06608488.pdf","startPage":"715","endPage":"721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy pattern trees as an alternative to rule-based fuzzy systems: Knowledge-driven, data-driven and hybrid modeling of color yield in polyester dyeing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy pattern trees as an alternative to rule-based fuzzy systems: Knowledge-driven, data-driven and hybrid modeling of color yield in polyester dyeing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608488/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608488/","accessionNumber":"13811710","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy pattern trees as an alternative to rule-based fuzzy systems: Knowledge-driven, data-driven and hybrid modeling of color yield in polyester dyeing","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079248S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596206","isNumber":"6608358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596206","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6608358","articleId":"6608488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6608546,"authors":[{"name":"Leticia Cervantes","affiliation":["Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Leticia","lastName":"Cervantes","id":"38062565200"},{"name":"Oscar Castillo","affiliation":["Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Castillo","id":"37271198900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0348-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608546","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Genetic algorithms","Valves","Optimization","Benchmark testing","Fuzzy logic","Level control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","level control","tanks (containers)","water storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical comparison","type-1 fuzzy systems design","type-2 fuzzy systems design","genetic algorithms","three tank water level control","empirical type-1 fuzzy system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Granular computing","Genetic ALgorithm","Type-2 Fuzzy System","Fuzzy Control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608546","abstract":"In this paper we show a statistical comparison using fuzzy systems for the benchmark case of three tank water level control.

The main idea is that the uncertainty in combining the outputs of the different modules in the MNN can be handled in a better way by using type-2 fuzzy logic. Previous works have considered using interval type-2 fuzzy logic for this task, but in this paper we are proposing the use of generalized type-2 fuzzy logic to improve the overall results of MNNs. The new method was tested with the problem of face recognition, showing that generalized type-2 fuzzy logic outperforms other approaches for the same task.","doi":"10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608594","startPage":"1331","endPage":"1336","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Joint IFSA World Congress and NAFIPS Annual Meeting (IFSA/NAFIPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596206/6608358/06608594.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Joint IFSA World Congress and NAFIPS Annual Meeting (IFSA/NAFIPS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFSA-NAFIPS.2013.6608594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized type-2 fuzzy logic in response integration of modular neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Fuzzy systems","Neural networks","Training","Uncertainty","Mathematical model","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","fuzzy logic","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized type-2 fuzzy logic","response integration","modular neural networks","MNN","face recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized type-2 fuzzy logic","modular neural networks","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Generalized type-2 fuzzy logic in response integration of modular neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608594/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13811607","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized type-2 fuzzy logic in response integration of modular neural networks","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062527S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596206","isNumber":"6608358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596206","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6608358","articleId":"6608594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6608609,"authors":[{"name":"Abraham Melendez","affiliation":["Department of Graduate Studies, Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Melendez","id":"37640435100"},{"name":"Oscar Castillo","affiliation":["Department of Graduate Studies, Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Castillo","id":"37271198900"},{"name":"Patricia Melin","affiliation":["Department of Graduate Studies, Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Melin","id":"37271192400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0348-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608609","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Robot sensing systems","Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy logic","Robot kinematics","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","fuzzy control","fuzzy reasoning","genetic algorithms","mobile robots","performance evaluation","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic optimization","interval type-2 fuzzy reactive controllers","evolutionary genetic algorithm approach","autonomous mobile robots","fuzzy inference system","performance evaluation","neuro-fuzzy fitness function","battery life","trajectory pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","reactive","control","fuzzylogic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608609","abstract":"This paper describes an evolutionary genetic algorithm approach for the optimization of a fuzzy reactive controller applied to an autonomous mobile robot.

The system uses coupler-based inverse fast Fourier transform/fast Fourier transform to support a 700 km single-mode fiber link and a transmission rate of 40 Gb/s without any nonlinear compensation. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using simulation and four performance measures are obtained, namely, the eye diagram, the eye-opening penalty (EOP), the power spectral broadening, and the bit error rate(BER). The effect of self-phase modulation is taken into account in the performance evaluation.

The performance of the considered system is affected by the combined effects of atmospheric turbulence-induced fading, pointing errors (i.e., misalignment fading), and path loss. Atmospheric turbulence conditions are modeled using the gamma-gamma distribution. For the system under consideration, accurate analytical approximations as well as upper bounds to the ergodic capacity are derived. In addition, bound approximations in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime are deduced that provide valuable insights into the impact of model parameters on the capacity of AF FSO dual-hop relaying systems.

Different converged network architectures can be deployed depending on individual circumstances to achieve improved performance without compromising cost-effectiveness. However, with different network architectures, different resource allocation mechanisms are required to achieve the best performance. This is problematic in both the deployment and operational phases. In this paper, we propose an architecture discovery enabled resource allocation (ADERA) mechanism for the long term evolution (LTE)-gigabit Ethernet passive optical network (GEPON) converged network. The proposed ADERA is a self-adaptive algorithm \u00bf it discovers the underlying architecture of the network by analyzing control signals and eventually evolves into an effective resource handling mechanism for the respective architecture. In addition, ADERA leverages inherited features of both the LTE network and GEPON in conjunction with the characteristics of their frame structures to improve the overall network performance. For example, ADERA is incorporated with a near-future traffic forecasting mechanism for efficient resource allocation. Using simulations, we evaluate the performance of our proposed ADERA algorithm and compare it against other existing resource allocation mechanisms. Our results indicate that ADERA achieves improved QoS performance in the converged network irrespective of the architecture used for the deployment.","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/6608629/06608647.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1095","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.5.001083","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.5.001083","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608647","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Resource management","Optical network units","Quality of service","Logic gates","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local area networks","Long Term Evolution","passive optical networks","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architecture discovery enabled resource allocation mechanism","next generation optical-wireless converged networks","optical-wireless convergence","quality-of-service","QoS","high-bandwidth access","ubiquitous access","resource allocation mechanisms","architecture discovery enabled resource allocation","ADERA mechanism","Long Term Evolution","LTE-gigabit Ethernet passive optical network","GEPON","self-adaptive algorithm","resource handling mechanism","traffic forecasting mechanism","resource allocation","QoS performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gigabit Ethernet passive optical network (GEPON)","Long term evolution (LTE)","Optical-wireless converged networks","Resource allocation algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608647/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Architecture discovery enabled resource allocation mechanism for next generation optical-wireless converged networks","accessionNumber":"13795266","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6608647/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture discovery enabled resource allocation mechanism for next generation optical-wireless converged networks","sourcePdf":"1083.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147687S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"6608629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6608629","articleId":"6608647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6608711,"authors":[{"name":"Gionata Cimini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Gionata","lastName":"Cimini","id":"38667654400"},{"name":"Gianluca Ippoliti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Ippoliti","id":"37300840500"},{"name":"Giuseppe Orlando","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Orlando","id":"37299337500"},{"name":"Matteo Pirro","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Pirro","id":"38243822600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0997-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0995-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608711","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Mathematical model","Inductors","Voltage control","Switches","Reactive power","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","feedforward","load regulation","observers","PI control","power control","power factor","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current sensorless solution","PFC boost converter","DCM","CCM","power factor control","AC-DC boost converter","PI-based control","input voltage feedforward control","current observer","continuous conduction mode","discontinuous conduction mode","software simulation platform"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a current sensorless solution for Power Factor Control (PFC) of an AC-DC boost converter operating in light load condition has been presented.

The proposed solution has been numerically tested in three different load conditions using a powerful software simulation platform.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2013.6608711","publicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589043/6608682/06608711.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2013.6608711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current sensorless solution for PFC boost converter operating both in DCM and CCM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608711/","displayDocTitle":"Current sensorless solution for PFC boost converter operating both in DCM and CCM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13797303","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608711/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current sensorless solution for PFC boost converter operating both in DCM and CCM","confLoc":"Platanias, Greece","sourcePdf":"0175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060431S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589043","isNumber":"6608682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589043","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6608682","articleId":"6608711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6608712,"authors":[{"name":"Samir Moulahoum","affiliation":["Research Laboratory on Electrical Engineering and Automatics (L.R.E.A), University of M\u00e9d\u00e9a, Algeria"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Moulahoum","id":"37297623700"},{"name":"Hamza Houassine","affiliation":["Research Laboratory on Electrical Engineering and Automatics (L.R.E.A), University of M\u00e9d\u00e9a, Algeria"],"firstName":"Hamza","lastName":"Houassine","id":"38252803500"},{"name":"Nadir Kabache","affiliation":["Research Laboratory on Electrical Engineering and Automatics (L.R.E.A), University of M\u00e9d\u00e9a, Algeria"],"firstName":"Nadir","lastName":"Kabache","id":"38016530000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0997-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0995-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608712","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Power harmonic filters","Harmonic analysis","Power filters","Filtering theory","Fluorescent lamps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","fluorescent lamps","harmonic distortion","power harmonic filters","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel active filter","compact fluorescent lamps","harmonic distortion","instantaneous active reactive power theory","p-q theory","Matlab","Simulink","SimPower Systems","electrical power supply quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CFL","parallel active power filter","harmonics distortion","P-Q theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608712","doi":"10.1109/MED.2013.6608712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2013.6608712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608682","publicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589043/6608682/06608712.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel active filter to eliminate harmonics generated by compact fluorescent lamps","abstract":"Use of nonlinear loads, such as power converters, fluorescent lamps and adjustable speed motor drives, is expected to grow rapidly.

However, recent events have highlighted the criticality of \"common mode\" failures on the Air Data System (ADS). In fact, since the parameters of flight control laws are typically scheduled as a function of airspeed, incorrect readings from the ADS can lead to potentially catastrophic conditions. In this paper, we describe the evaluation of an analytical redundancy-based approach to the problem of Sensor Failure Accommodation following simulated failures on the ADS of a research UAV, using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Specifically, two different neural networks are evaluated - the Extended Minimal Resource Allocating Network and a Multilayer Feedforward NN. These neural networks are trained and validated using experimental flight data from the WVU YF-22 research aircraft which was designed, manufactured, instrumented, and flight tested by researchers at the Flight Control Systems Laboratory at West Virginia University. The performance of the two approaches is evaluated in terms of the statistics of the tracking error in the estimation of the airspeed, as compared to actual measurements from the ADS, operating under nominal conditions.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2013.6608784","startPage":"603","endPage":"608","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589043/6608682/06608784.pdf","publicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2013.6608784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of neural network based approaches for airspeed Sensor Failure Accommodation on a small UAV","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks","Aircraft","Neurons","Aerospace control","Redundancy","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","aircraft testing","autonomous aerial vehicles","fault tolerance","feedforward neural nets","neurocontrollers","redundancy","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","airspeed sensor failure accommodation","sensor fault tolerance","flight control systems","triple physical redundancy","quadruple physical redundancy","common mode failures","air data system","ADS","flight control laws","catastrophic conditions","analytical redundancy-based approach","research UAV","artificial neural networks","ANN","extended minimal resource allocating network","multilayer feedforward NN","flight data","WVU YF-22 research aircraft","Flight Control Systems Laboratory","West Virginia University","tracking error","airspeed estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of neural network based approaches for airspeed Sensor Failure Accommodation on a small UAV","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608784/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13797305","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of neural network based approaches for airspeed Sensor Failure Accommodation on a small UAV","confLoc":"Platanias, Greece","sourcePdf":"0265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068261S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589043","isNumber":"6608682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589043","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6608682","articleId":"6608784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6608840,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Sabattini","affiliation":["Department of Science and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Sabattini","id":"37594737400"},{"name":"Cristian Secchi","affiliation":["Department of Science and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Secchi","id":"37300905500"},{"name":"Nikhil Chopra","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Chopra","id":"37283228300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0997-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0995-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608840","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Laplace equations","Estimation","Robots","Protocols","Computer architecture","Decentralized control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","decentralised control","directed graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative tasks","decentralized systems","communication graph connectivity","connectivity maintenance","decentralized control","estimation strategy","connectivity property","directed communication graphs","control strategy","balanced digraphs","decentralized balancing algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608840","doi":"10.1109/MED.2013.6608840","publicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","abstract":"In order to accomplish cooperative tasks, decentralized systems are required to communicate among each other.

Then, the adaptive case (unknown disturbance) is examined. It is shown under what conditions the unknown periodic disturbances can be suppressed and what parameters contribute to the performance of the overall adaptive control scheme. The stability and performance of the adaptive schemes is analyzed, and finally numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive suppression of periodic disturbances in MIMO linear systems","publicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/MED.2013.6608842","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589043/6608682/06608842.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"1001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2013.6608842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive suppression of periodic disturbances in MIMO linear systems","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608842/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13797267","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive suppression of periodic disturbances in MIMO linear systems","confLoc":"Platanias, Greece","sourcePdf":"0165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08695S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589043","isNumber":"6608682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589043","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6608682","articleId":"6608842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6608859,"authors":[{"name":"Zohir Irki","affiliation":["LSN, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Zohir","lastName":"Irki","id":"38096558900"},{"name":"Hamza Bendaoudi","affiliation":["LSN, Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Hamza","lastName":"Bendaoudi","id":"37074090600"},{"name":"Michel Devy","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'analyse et d'architecture des systemes, Toulouse, Midi-Pyr\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9es, FR"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Devy","id":"37323948800"},{"name":"Abdelhakim Khouas","affiliation":["University of M'hamed\u00a0Bouguerra, Boumerdes, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdelhakim","lastName":"Khouas","id":"37270854000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0997-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0995-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608859","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Stereo image processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Transforms","Real-time systems","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","Hough transforms","image matching","object detection","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","V-disparity based obstacles detection approach","FPGA component","stereoscopic images","stereoscopic matching","V-disparity image construction","obstacles extraction","unidirectional Hough transform","VHDL language","ISE 9.2 software","Virtex-II type XC2V1000 FG456-4","RC200 board"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","CENSUS stereoscopic matching","V-disparity","Obstacles detection","Hough transform"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present an implementation of the whole V-disparity obstacles detection approach on an FPGA component.

The main targeted application is robotic beating heart surgery, which enables the surgeon to operate directly on a beating heart. Using a motion compensation framework, the motion of the heart surface is stabilized in a virtual space, which is presented to the surgeon to operate in. Consequently, the fixture is implemented in this static space, bypassing problems of dynamic fixtures such as position update, placement and force transients. Randomized experiments were performed using a trained surgeon comparing our approach to simple motion compensation and no compensation at all.

The proposed controller has a feedforward-feedback control structure that is designed for a motorway arterial model. For the feedback design the nonlinear model predictive control is used. The feedforward control is utilized to enhance the operability of the control system to high disturbances. Two different controllers are designed: while controller A uses continuous VSL signs, VSL input values of controller B is chosen from a discrete set. For the latter, a two-step optimization is used to decrease oscillations. The designed controllers are tested in a case study, in which a total traffic breakdown situation is modeled. In the uncontrolled case, the initial perturbation leads to a traffic jam with zero traffic speed, whereas the proposed control design is capable of preventing the congestion.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2013.6608931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2013.6608931","startPage":"1569","endPage":"1574","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589043/6608682/06608931.pdf","publicationTitle":"21st Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Freeway shockwave control using ramp metering and variable speed limits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Freeway shockwave control using ramp metering and variable speed limits","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608931/","accessionNumber":"13797391","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608931/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Freeway shockwave control using ramp metering and variable speed limits","confLoc":"Platanias, Greece","sourcePdf":"0026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043299S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589043","isNumber":"6608682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589043","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6608682","articleId":"6608931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6608933,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaud Bruyas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Bruyas","id":"37075070700"},{"name":"Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Papanikolopoulos","id":"37278578300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0997-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0995-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6608933","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Target tracking","Optimization","Accuracy","Real-time systems","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance analysis","genetic algorithms","image representation","object tracking","Pareto optimisation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance descriptors","image based element manipulation","object representation","children tracking","statistical interrelationships","niched Pareto genetic algorithm","NPGA","selection method","reproduction method","dictionary learning problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6608933","abstract":"The problem of real-time tracking has been studied widely and many methods in very different fields of application have been developed manipulating image based elements. While all use features as a way to represent a tracked object in the image, naturally, depending on the method and the objects, some features are better than others. As part of the project presented in [1], the goal of this paper is to provide efficient descriptors to perform real-time tracking of children. Covariance descriptors are a common and convenient way to describe an object, since they compile in a single matrix several features and also their statistical interrelationships. This paper introduces a Genetic Algorithm as a way to seek the best combination among a list of features for describing a selected object in a video sequence. The implemented Genetic Algorithm is a Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NPGA), and two different methods of selection/reproduction have been compared; a regular method and one based on a High Elitism process. Reliable results are obtained, since the features combined seem to match the tracked object characteristics, but dissimilarities between the two methods are also highlighted.

Its general character has enabled its application to different types of problems: vehicle routing, planning, scheduling, etc. This article shows that there is controversy in the basic structure of the algorithm steps when it is applied at routing problems. Specifically in this paper we show that the crossover (CX) offers no advantage in the optimization process. To solve such problems, the most important steps are mutation and selection of individuals. These two steps are what help to analyze the solution space exhaustively and give GA optimization capability. To prove our hypothesis we will analyze the results obtained by applying different blind crossover operators to solve multiple instances of the TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem).","doi":"10.1109/SACI.2013.6608960","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 8th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589050/6608938/06608960.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 8th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SACI.2013.6608960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6608938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the suitability of using blind crossover operators in genetic algorithms for solving routing problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Routing","Space exploration","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","genetic algorithms","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind crossover operators","genetic algorithms","routing problems","combinatorial optimization problems","planning problems","scheduling problems","optimization process","GA optimization capability","travelling salesman problem","TSP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Crossover Operator","Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6608960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the suitability of using blind crossover operators in genetic algorithms for solving routing problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6608960/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13797466","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the suitability of using blind crossover operators in genetic algorithms for solving routing problems","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"2saci2013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098954S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589050","isNumber":"6608938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589050","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6608938","articleId":"6608960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6609013,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It is not necessarily assumed that the virtual target point (VTP) is known all the time. On the other hand, it must be online estimated. First, the HR searches the ball field to find the gate or the ball, which is not necessarily in front of an HR. After the complete search of the specific ball or the gate, the HR is navigated by a neural-network-based active embedded vision system (AEVS). If the gate is far away from the HR (e.g., larger than 1.8 m), the ball is kicked and tracked by the HR. Then, the HR reaches the planned posture with respect to the gate, and the STKVTP of the HR is accomplished. Four important features are described as follows: 1) The modeling using multilayer neural network for four pitch angles of AEVS to form a connected visible region for navigation is established; 2) the error sensitivities in the pan and tilt directions and the height with respect to four view angles are analyzed and compared; 3) the search strategy for the specific ball or the gate is developed; and 4) the visual navigation strategy, including position and orientation revisions, for the STKVTP of the HR is designed. Finally, three representative experiments are applied to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our methodology.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2013.2280852","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7053977/06609036.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2013.2280852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7053977","startPage":"107","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u201cSearch, Track, and Kick to Virtual Target Point\u201d of Humanoid Robots by a Neural-Network-Based Active Embedded Vision System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"\u201cSearch, Track, and Kick to Virtual Target Point\u201d of Humanoid Robots by a Neural-Network-Based Active Embedded Vision System","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14965206","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6609036/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC-99-2221-E-011-161-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u201cSearch, Track, and Kick to Virtual Target Point\u201d of Humanoid Robots by a Neural-Network-Based Active Embedded Vision System","sourcePdf":"jsyst-hwang-2280852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10403S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7053977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7053977","articleId":"6609036","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6609050,"authors":[{"name":"Victor I.

Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging whole-body imaging modality that shows great potential for preclinical research. As a hybrid technique, PAT is based on the acoustic detection of optical absorption from either endogenous tissue chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, or exogenous contrast agents. Because ultrasound scatters much less than light in tissue, PAT generates high-resolution images in both the optical ballistic and diffusive regimes. Using near-infrared light, which has relatively low blood absorption, PAT can image through the whole body of small animals with acoustically defined spatial resolution. Anatomical and vascular structures are imaged with endogenous hemoglobin contrast, while functional and molecular images are enabled by the wide choice of exogenous optical contrasts. This paper reviews the rapidly growing field of small-animal whole-body PAT and highlights studies done in the past decade.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6800026/06609058.pdf","startPage":"1380","endPage":"1389","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2283507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2283507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-Animal Whole-Body Photoacoustic Tomography: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Small-Animal Whole-Body Photoacoustic Tomography: A Review","htmlLink":"/document/6609058/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14238930","pubMedId":"24108456","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"DP1 EB016986, R01 EB016963, R01 EB008085, R01CA134539, U54CA136398, R01 EB010049, R01CA157277 and R01CA159959"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Animal Whole-Body Photoacoustic Tomography: A Review","sourcePdf":"tbme-wang-2283507-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.273244S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6800026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6800026","articleId":"6609058","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6609063,"authors":[{"name":"Xingchi He","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Xingchi","lastName":"He","id":"38240748700"},{"name":"James Handa","affiliation":["Department of Ophthalmology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Handa","id":"37568981400"},{"name":"Peter Gehlbach","affiliation":["Department of Ophthalmology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Gehlbach","id":"37547001700"},{"name":"Russell Taylor","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Taylor","id":"37277162900"},{"name":"Iulian Iordachita","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Iulian","lastName":"Iordachita","id":"37330620500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"6609063","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1669},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"abstract":"Vitreoretinal surgery requires very fine motor control to perform precise manipulation of the delicate tissue in the interior of the eye. Besides physiological hand tremor, fatigue, poor kinesthetic feedback, and patient movement, the absence of force sensing is one of the main technical challenges. Previous two degrees of freedom (DOF) force sensing instruments have demonstrated robust force measuring performance. The main design challenge is to incorporate high sensitivity axial force sensing. This paper reports the development of a submillimetric 3-DOF force sensing pick instrument based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The configuration of the four FBG sensors is arranged to maximize the decoupling between axial and transverse force sensing. A superelastic nitinol flexure is designed to achieve high axial force sensitivity. An automated calibration system was developed for repeatability testing, calibration, and validation. Experimental results demonstrate a FBG sensor repeatability of 1.3 pm. The linear model for calculating the transverse forces provides an accurate global estimate. While the linear model for axial force is only locally accurate within a conical region with a 30\u00b0 vertex angle, a second-order polynomial model can provide a useful global estimate for axial force. Combining the linear model for transverse forces and nonlinear model for axial force, the 3-DOF force sensing instrument can provide sub-millinewton resolution for axial force and a quarter millinewton for transverse forces. Validation with random samples show the force sensor can provide consistent and accurate measurement of 3-D forces.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6714426/06609063.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2283501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2283501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6714426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Submillimetric 3-DOF Force Sensing Instrument With Integrated Fiber Bragg Grating for Retinal Microsurgery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Instruments","Robot sensing systems","Fiber gratings","Strain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical optical imaging","Bragg gratings","calibration","eye","fibre optic sensors","force sensors","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["submillimetric 3-DOF force sensing instrument","integrated fiber Bragg grating","retinal microsurgery","vitreoretinal surgery","very fine motor control","eye interior tissue","physiological hand tremor","fatigue","poor kinesthetic feedback","patient movement","high sensitivity axial force sensing","fiber Bragg grating sensors","transverse force sensing","superelastic nitinol flexure","automated calibration system","repeatability testing","validation","FBG sensor repeatability","transverse forces","linear model","conical region","second-order polynomial model","submillinewton resolution","quarter millinewton","force sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bragg gratings","force feedback","force measurement","force sensors","surgical instruments"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Calibration","Feedback","Mechanical Phenomena","Microsurgery","Reproducibility of Results","Robotics","Temperature","Vitreoretinal Surgery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Submillimetric 3-DOF Force Sensing Instrument With Integrated Fiber Bragg Grating for Retinal Microsurgery","volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6609063/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14032663","pubMedId":"24108455","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Submillimetric 3-DOF Force Sensing Instrument With Integrated Fiber Bragg Grating for Retinal Microsurgery","sourcePdf":"tbme-he-2283501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144547S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6714426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6714426","articleId":"6609063","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6609067,"authors":[{"name":"Kenji Miyamoto","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph And Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Kenji Miyamoto received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2010 and M.E. degree in electrical, electronic and information engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 2012.

To investigate the performance of bandpass-sampled and time domain multiplexed optical signals, and enhance the transmission performance in the wireless link of the RoF-DAS over WDM-PON, we perform two-tone signal transmission experiments with 2.4 GHz band radio frequency (RF) signals and analyze the RF carrier power, third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD) power and noise power. The analysis results confirmed that the nonlinearity of the proposed system is mainly caused by a lithium niobate-Mach-Zehnder modulator (LN-MZM) as with the other RoF systems and that the dominant noise components are the signal-spontaneous beat noise arising from the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of two erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) and the signal-signal beat noise caused by the interference between the optical TDM pulses. The latter is the specific noise component in the proposed system. In addition, we clarify the principle of the signal-signal beat noise generation and report that the signal-spontaneous beat noise can be reduced by the gain optimization of the two EDFAs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6609067/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2013","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13842704","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Performance Investigation of RF Signal in RoF-DAS Over WDM-PON With Bandpass-Sampling and Optical TDM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Performance Investigation of RF Signal in RoF-DAS Over WDM-PON With Bandpass-Sampling and Optical TDM","sourcePdf":"jlt-miyamoto-2283522-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090033S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6630089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6630089","articleId":"6609067","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6609069,"authors":[{"name":"Jian He","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6781564/6609069/he-2283430-small.gif","p":["Jian He received the B.S. degree in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2011.","He is a graduate student with the Department of Computer Science, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University.

Under such a paradigm, a video service provider (VSP) can launch its own video streaming services virtually by renting the distribution infrastructure from one or more cloud service providers (CSPs). However, CSPs such as Amazon EC2 normally offer multiple pricing options for virtual machine (VM) instances that they can provide, such as on-demand instances, reserved instances, and spot instances. Such diverse pricing models make it challenging for a VSP to determine how to optimally procure the required number of VM instances in different types to satisfy dynamic user demands. Given the limited budget, a VSP needs to carefully balance the procurement cost and the achieved QoE for end users. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between the cost incurred by VM instance procurement and the achieved QoE of end users under Amazon EC2's pricing models, and formulate the VM instance provisioning and procurement problem into a constrained stochastic optimization problem. By applying the Lyapunov optimization framework, we design an online procurement algorithm, which approaches the optimal solution with explicitly provable upper bounds. We also conduct extensive trace-driven simulations and our results show that our proposed algorithm (OPT-ORS) achieves a good balance between the procurement cost and the user QoE for cloud-based VSPs. In the achieved near-optimal situation, our algorithm guarantees that reserved VM instances are fully utilized to satisfy the baseline user demand, on-demand VM instances are only rented to handle flash crowds, while more spot VM instances are rented than on-demand VM instances to serve user demand over the baseline due to their low prices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14210069","htmlLink":"/document/6609069/","displayDocTitle":"On the Cost\u2013QoE Tradeoff for Cloud-Based Video Streaming Under Amazon EC2's Pricing Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Cost\u2013QoE Tradeoff for Cloud-Based Video Streaming Under Amazon EC2's Pricing Models","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-he-2283430-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084436S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6781564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6781564","articleId":"6609069","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":6609074,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Erro","affiliation":["AhoLab Signal Processing Laboratory, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Bilbao, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Daniel Erro received his telecommunication engineering degree from UPNA in 2003 and his Ph.D. degree from UPC in 2008.

The idea is to use an iterative ADP technique to obtain the iterative control law, which optimizes the iterative performance index function. The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the convergence and stability properties of policy iteration method for discrete-time nonlinear systems for the first time. It shows that the iterative performance index function is nonincreasingly convergent to the optimal solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. It is also proven that any of the iterative control laws can stabilize the nonlinear systems. Neural networks are used to approximate the performance index function and compute the optimal control law, respectively, for facilitating the implementation of the iterative ADP algorithm, where the convergence of the weight matrices is analyzed. Finally, the numerical results and analysis are presented to illustrate the performance of the developed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609085/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14111776","pubMedId":"24807455","volume":"25","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Policy Iteration Adaptive Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61034002, 61233001, 61273140 and 61374105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4132078"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Policy Iteration Adaptive Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-liu-2281663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084756S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6740874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"321","xplore-issue":"6740874","articleId":"6609085","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6609101,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Romero","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6657827/6609101/6609101-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Romero (S'11) received the telecommunication engineering and the M.S. degrees from University of Vigo (Spain) in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

However, broad bands require expensive acquisition systems, thus motivating the use of compressive schemes. In this context, previous works in compressive WSS have already realized that great compression rates can be achieved if only second-order statistics are of interest in spectrum sensing. In this paper, we go a step further by exploiting spectral prior information that is typically available in practice in order to reduce the sampling rate even more. The signal model assumes that the acquisition is done by means of an analog-to-information converter (A2I). The input signal is the linear combination of a number of signals whose second-order statistics are known and the goal is to estimate/decide over the coefficients of this combination. The problem is thus a particular instance of the well-known structured covariance estimation problem. Unfortunately, the algorithms used in this area are extremely complex for inexpensive spectrum sensors so that alternative techniques need to be devised. Exploiting the fact that the basis matrices are Toeplitz, we use the asymptotic theory of circulant matrices to propose a dimensionality reduction technique that simplifies existing structured covariance estimation algorithms, achieving a similar performance at a much lower computational cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609101/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","volume":"61","issue":"24","accessionNumber":"13888679","publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609101/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Spectrum Sensing From Compressed Measurements Using Spectral Prior Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Spectrum Sensing From Compressed Measurements Using Spectral Prior Information","sourcePdf":"tsp-romero-2283473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119726S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6657827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6657827","articleId":"6609101","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6609106,"authors":[{"name":"Weicheng Zhou","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6709815/6609106/6609106-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weicheng Zhou received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include reliability and thermal characterization of power semiconductor devices."]},"firstName":"Weicheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38572568100"},{"name":"Xueqian Zhong","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6709815/6609106/6609106-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Xueqian Zhong received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2008, where she is currently working toward the Ph.

The problem of power allocation is then to maximize the throughput, taking into account the fact that channel conditions and energy sources are time varying. In particular, for the constraints of the target problem, besides the allocated power values being nonnegative, the successively harvested energy sum leads to the triangle coefficient matrix of the power sum constraints. In this paper, we propose a geometric waterfilling (GWF) algorithm in place of the conventional waterfilling (CWF) algorithm for power allocation with a sum power constraint. We then recursively apply the GWF as a functional block to sequentially solve the power allocation problem for energy harvesting transmission in a fading channel. This algorithm is referred to as RGWF. The proposed RGWF is further extended to solving the minimization of the transmission completion time (referred to as RGWFn) by inserting a condition to check if the preset information transmission data bits are achieved. Since RGWF is defined by recursion and along natural progress of time, we can compute a family of solutions for subprocesses from epoch 1 to epoch k, for k = 1, ..., K, where K is the index of the final epoch for the entire process. Thus, RGWF can be utilized for efficiently carrying out the computation of RGWFn. RGWF and RGWFn belong to dynamical recursive algorithms. Compared with the existing results in the open literature, the proposed algorithms have distinguished features: 1) They provide the exact optimal solutions via efficient finite computation under the recursive category, and 2) the optimality of the proposed algorithms is strictly proven. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the procedures to obtain the optimal power allocation by using the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2283505","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6766688/06609107.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2283505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Waterfilling for Wireless Links With Energy Harvesting Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Waterfilling for Wireless Links With Energy Harvesting Transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609107/","volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6609107/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14159220","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Waterfilling for Wireless Links With Energy Harvesting Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhao-2283505-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104793S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6766688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6766688","articleId":"6609107","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6609113,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

Those that involve a vertical cylindrical channel are regarded as favorites. These include bit-cost scalable (BiCS) NAND, pipe-shaped bit-cost scalable (p-BiCS) NAND, and terabit cell array transistor (TCAT) NAND. It has been assumed that their manufacturing costs decrease monotonically with the number of additional device layers. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of this assumption based on recently reported challenges associated with the construction of these architectures. It is shown that there is a minimum in die cost after which costs increase with increasing device layers. Also, achievable die sizes using these approaches may not even reach existing production NAND Flash. An important consequence is that monolithic 3-D approaches that involve more lithography-intensive steps may actually result in lower total cost provided that these scale appropriately.","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2013.2283274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2013.2283274","startPage":"619","endPage":"625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel7/66/6648707/06609113.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Rigorous 3-D NAND Flash Cost Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Rigorous 3-D NAND Flash Cost Analysis","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13875672","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6609113/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Rigorous 3-D NAND Flash Cost Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsm-walker-2283274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078016S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"6648707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6648707","articleId":"6609113","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6609115,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-Kai Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6609087/6609115/6609115-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shin-Kai Chen was born in Taiwan.

To improve the performance under a pessimistic assumption on the pipeline efficiency, a high-speed and energy-efficient VLSBM is proposed that successively performs a speculating and correcting phase. To reduce the critical path, the VLSBM partial products are partitioned into the (n-z)-bit least significant part (LSP) and the self-reliant (n+z)-bit most significant part (MSP), and an estimation function stochastically predicts the carry to the MSP, thereby allowing independent calculation of the partial-product accumulation of parts. When a carry prediction is accurate, the data dependence is hidden and the correcting phase is bypassed, thereby ensuring the potential speed-up of the pipelined datapath. If a prediction is inaccurate, the speculation is flushed and the correcting phase is executed to obtain the exact multiplication. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed VLSBM.

People are able to take photos and share their experiences anytime and anywhere. However, taking a high quality photograph via mobile device remains a challenge for mobile users. In this paper we investigate a photography model to assist mobile users in capturing high quality photos by using both the rich context available from mobile devices and crowdsourced social media on the Web. The photography model is learned from community-contributed images on the Web, and dependent on user's social context. The context includes user's current geo-location, time (i.e., time of the day), and weather (e.g., clear, cloudy, foggy, etc.). Given a wide view of scene, our socialized mobile photography system is able to suggest the optimal view enclosure (composition) and appropriate camera parameters (aperture, ISO, and exposure time). Extensive experiments have been performed for eight well-known hot spot landmark locations where sufficient context tagged photos can be obtained. Through both objective and subjective evaluations, we show that the proposed socialized mobile photography system can indeed effectively suggest proper composition and camera parameters to help the user capture high quality photos.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Photography","Context","Cameras","Mobile handsets","Apertures","Meteorology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","digital photography","mobile computing","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["socialized mobile photography system","photograph quality","mobile device","crowdsourced social media","Web","community-contributed image","optimal view enclosure","camera parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Camera parameters","mobile photography","social context","social media","view enclosure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2283468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6683077/06609129.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6683077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2283468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Socialized Mobile Photography: Learning to Photograph With Social Context via Mobile Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Socialized Mobile Photography: Learning to Photograph With Social Context via Mobile Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609129/","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609129/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13972890","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Socialized Mobile Photography: Learning to Photograph With Social Context via Mobile Devices","sourcePdf":"tmm-mei-2283468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098094S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6683077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6683077","articleId":"6609129","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6609131,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Bucher","affiliation":["Rambus Inc Chapel Hill, Sunnyvale, CA, U.S.A."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6690141/6609131/6609131-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Bucher (M'09) received the B.S. degree in physics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA, in 2004, and the M.S.E.E. degree from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA, in 2008.","He joined Rambus Inc., Chapel Hill, NC, USA, in 2009, where he is currently a Senior Member of Technical Staff.

In the method, the maximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation are ensured to be within prescribed levels, while at the same time maintaining a good linear-phase characteristic at a prescribed group delay in the passband. Since the beamformer is intended primarily for small-sized microphone arrays where the microphone spacing is small relative to the wavelength at low frequencies, the beamformer can become highly sensitive to spatial white noise and array imperfections if a direct minimization of the error is performed. Therefore, to limit the sensitivity of the beamformer the optimization is carried out by constraining a sensitivity parameter, namely, the white noise gain (WNG) to be above prescribed levels across the frequency band. Two novel design variants have been developed. The first variant is formulated as a convex optimization problem where the maximum error in the passband is minimized, while the second variant is formulated as an iterative optimization problem and has the advantage of significantly improving the linear-phase characteristics of the beamformer under any prescribed group delay or linear-array configuration. In the second variant, the passband group-delay deviation is minimized while ensuring that the maximum passband ripple and stopband attenuation are within prescribed levels. To reduce the computational effort in carrying out the optimization, a nonuniform variable sampling approach over the frequency and angular dimensions is used to compute the required parameters. Experiment results show that beamformers designed using the proposed methods have much smaller passband group-delay deviation for similar passband ripple and stopband attenuation than a modified version of an existing method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13875264","htmlLink":"/document/6609134/","displayDocTitle":"L -infinity norm design of linear-phase robust broadband beamformers using constrained optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"L -infinity norm design of linear-phase robust broadband beamformers using constrained optimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-nongpiur-2283463-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09051S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6648447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6648447","articleId":"6609134","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6609136,"authors":[{"name":"Kaibin Huang","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Kaibin Huang (SM'08) received the B.Eng.

In this paper, the spatial throughput of a mobile ad hoc network powered by energy harvesting is analyzed using a stochastic-geometry model. In this model, transmitters are distributed as a Poisson point process and energy arrives at each transmitter randomly with a uniform average rate called the energy arrival rate. Upon harvesting sufficient energy, each transmitter transmits with fixed power to an intended receiver under an outage-probability constraint for a target signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. It is assumed that transmitters store energy in batteries with infinite capacity. By applying the random-walk theory, the probability that a transmitter transmits, called the transmission probability, is proved to be equal to the smaller of one and the ratio between the energy-arrival rate and transmission power. This result and tools from stochastic geometry are applied to maximize the network throughput for a given energy-arrival rate by optimizing transmission power. The maximum network throughput is shown to be proportional to the optimal transmission probability, which is equal to one if the transmitter density is below a derived function of the energy-arrival rate or otherwise is smaller than one and solves a given polynomial equation. Last, the limits of the maximum network throughput are obtained for the extreme cases of high energy-arrival rates and sparse/dense networks.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2276811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6634534/06609136.pdf","startPage":"7597","endPage":"7612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6634534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2276811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Throughput of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks Powered by Energy Harvesting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Throughput of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks Powered by Energy Harvesting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609136/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13842974","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609136/","volume":"59","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Throughput of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks Powered by Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tit-huang-2276811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15368S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6634534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6634534","articleId":"6609136","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6609138,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Ye","affiliation":["UC Berkeley, Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC), Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6671390/6609138/6609138-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lu Ye (S'11\u2013M'13) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 2013.","During the summer of 2010, he was with HMicro Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA, working on low-power ultra-wideband (UWB) receiver.

With the assumption that the subsets of the data set contain enough information, we theoretically prove that the improvement of detection or estimation performance, compared with the original performance without jackknifing, is guaranteed when the detection or estimation accuracy is greater than or equal to 50%.

In this paper, we propose a multilocal search and adaptive niching-based genetic algorithm with a consensus criterion for automatic data clustering. The proposed algorithm employs three local searches of different features in a sophisticated manner to efficiently exploit the decision space. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive niching method, which can dynamically adjust its parameter value depending on the problem instance as well as the search progress, and incorporate it into the proposed algorithm. The adaptation strategy is based on a newly devised population diversity index, which can be used to promote both genetic diversity and fitness. Consequently, diverged niches of high fitness can be formed and maintained in the population, making the approach well-suited to effective exploration of the complex decision space of clustering problems. The resulting algorithm has been used to optimize a consensus clustering criterion, which is suggested with the purpose of achieving reliable solutions. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we have conducted a series of experiments on both synthetic and real data and compared it with other reported methods. The results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance, outperforming related methods.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2283513","startPage":"721","endPage":"741","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6913027/06609147.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2283513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6913027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilocal Search and Adaptive Niching Based Memetic Algorithm With a Consensus Criterion for Data Clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilocal search","adaptive niching based memetic algorithm","consensus criterion","data clustering","machine learning","decision space","parameter value","adaptation strategy","population diversity index","genetic diversity","consensus clustering criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","Genetic algorithm","Memetic algorithm","Niching method","Parameter Adaptation","Local search","Cluster validity"]},{"kwd":["Clustering","cluster validity","genetic algorithm","local search","memetic algorithm","niching method","parameter adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Multilocal Search and Adaptive Niching Based Memetic Algorithm With a Consensus Criterion for Data Clustering","volume":"18","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6609147/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2014","accessionNumber":"14633744","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203288, 61272310, 61173096, 613250211 and 61170271"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LY12F02031"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilocal Search and Adaptive Niching Based Memetic Algorithm With a Consensus Criterion for Data Clustering","sourcePdf":"tevc-sheng-2283513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155888S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6913027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6913027","articleId":"6609147","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6609148,"authors":[{"name":"Qinglai Wei","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/6902836/6609148/6609148-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qinglai Wei (M'11) received the B.S. degree in automation, the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering, from the Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2002, 2005, and 2008, respectively.","From 2009 to 2011, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

The idea is to use an iterative ADP algorithm to obtain the iterative control law which optimizes the iterative performance index function. In the present iterative \u03b8-ADP algorithm, the condition of initial admissible control in policy iteration algorithm is avoided. It is proved that all the iterative controls obtained in the iterative \u03b8-ADP algorithm can stabilize the nonlinear system which means that the iterative \u03b8-ADP algorithm is feasible for implementations both online and offline. Convergence analysis of the performance index function is presented to guarantee that the iterative performance index function will converge to the optimum monotonically. Neural networks are used to approximate the performance index function and compute the optimal control policy, respectively, for facilitating the implementation of the iterative \u03b8-ADP algorithm. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the performance of the established method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14633717","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609148/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Iterative <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\theta $</tex></formula>-Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Iterative <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\theta $</tex></formula>-Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tase-liu-2280974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109938S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6902836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6902836","articleId":"6609148","onlineDate":"25 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6609149,"authors":[{"name":"Benqing Guo","affiliation":["No.38 Research Institute of CETC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Benqing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37854170400"},{"name":"Xiaolei Li","affiliation":["Beijing Microelectronics Technology Institute, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086623567"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6609149","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1826},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Nonlinear distortion","CMOS integrated circuits","Impedance matching","Transistors","Noise measurement","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","Chebyshev filters","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order nonlinear currents","third-order nonlinear currents","noise figure","band-pass Chebyshev filter","PMOS transistor","post distortion technique","CMOS LNA","low noise amplifier","UWB","linearized ultra-wideband","frequency 1.6 GHz to 9.7 GHz","size 0.18 mum","gain 9.6 dB to 12.6 dB","noise figure 3.9 dB to 5.8 dB","power 10.6 mW","voltage 1.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linearity","low noise amplifier (LNA)","noise figure (NF)","post distortion","ultra-wideband (UWB)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609149","abstract":"A linearized ultra-wideband (UWB) CMOS low noise amplifier (LNA) is proposed.

We propose a mechanism in which the prices reflect congestion on routers and thus the waiting time for packet to pass through the router. These prices increase as usage of the usually preferred shorter routes increases. The packet's ability to pay price on a router is defined by the product of application's priority and the delay experienced at the router. As a result, the low priority applications intelligently avoid paths with high prices and go via low price routes. The low price routes may possibly be longer but require shorter waiting for passage at congested routers making them faster for low priority packets. This enables high priority traffic to get through quickly via shorter paths as they are able to pay high prices after little wait. Thus, our approach distributes traffic flows of different applications in the network and lowers congestion and delays for all applications. We further show that our dynamic path allocation technique ensures robust communication in fully functional as well as partially damaged networks. Our dynamic pricing mechanism quickly adapts routing to the damaged network, increases utilization of the partial network to lower the impact on critical infrastructure and key resources. Moreover, our proposed mechanism is equally applicable to both communication networks and physical infrastructure networks.","doi":"10.1109/NSW.2013.6609187","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 2nd Network Science Workshop (NSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 2nd Network Science Workshop (NSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596017/6609181/06609187.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSW.2013.6609187","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 29 2013-May 1 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609187/","displayDocTitle":"Price based routing for event driven prioritized traffic in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13798171","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609187/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"29 April-1 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Price based routing for event driven prioritized traffic in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"West Point, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"S01P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063581S","chronDate":"April 29 2013-May 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596017","isNumber":"6609181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596017","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6609181","articleId":"6609187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6609287,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Computer aided detection of abnormality in medical images is primarily motivated by the necessity of achieving maximum possible accuracy. There are lots of methods for automatic and semi- automatic image classification, though most of them fail because of unknown noise, poor image contrast, inhomogeneity and boundaries that are usual in medical images. The MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging) brain tumor segmentation is a complicated task due to the variance and intricacy of tumors. The principle aim of the project is to perform the MRI Brain image classification of cancer, based on Rough Set Theory and Feed Forward Neural Network classifier. For this purpose, first the features are extracted from the input MRI images using Rough set theory, and then the selected features are given as input to Feed Forward Neural Network classifier. Finally, Feed Forward Neural Network classifier is utilized to perform two functions. The first is to differentiate between normal and abnormal. The second function is to classify the type of abnormality in benign or malignant tumor.","doi":"10.1109/ICANMEET.2013.6609287","startPage":"240","endPage":"244","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Advanced Nanomaterials & Emerging Engineering Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596024/6609218/06609287.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Advanced Nanomaterials & Emerging Engineering Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICANMEET.2013.6609287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rough set theory and feed forward neural network based brain tumor detection in magnetic resonance images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Image segmentation","Magnetic resonance imaging","Malignant tumors","Lesions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","cancer","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","medical image processing","rough set theory","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rough set theory","feed forward neural network classifier","brain tumor detection","magnetic resonance image segmentation","computer aided detection","medical image processing","noise","image contrast","brain tumor segmentation","MRI brain image classification","cancer","feature extraction","benign tumor","malignant tumor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feed Forward Neural Network","MRI","Rough Set Theory","Explicit region","Gaussian Filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Rough set theory and feed forward neural network based brain tumor detection in magnetic resonance images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609287/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13798246","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rough set theory and feed forward neural network based brain tumor detection in magnetic resonance images","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"VIIITC6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037303S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596024","isNumber":"6609218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596024","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6609218","articleId":"6609287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6609358,"authors":[{"name":"P Sreedevi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication, College of Engineering Trivandrum, Thiruvananthapuram, India"],"firstName":"P","lastName":"Sreedevi","id":"37085934173"},{"name":"N.

A low-complex, real trigonometric transform-based Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing for Radio-over-Fiber system (RoF) is presented. The modulation/demodulation is performed by using the Fast Hartley Transform (FHT). The system is modeled and simulated using latest commercial software, Optisystem. This is an exquisite method that uses standard components of optical telecommunication. As a result this model can be used with different wireless communication systems such as high date rate Wireless LANs, Fiber-To-Home (FTTH), Wi-Max and the 4th generation cellular systems. It also find applications in inter connecting nano-photonic systems remotely over wireless systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Advanced Nanomaterials & Emerging Engineering Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596024/6609218/06609358.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"546","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Advanced Nanomaterials & Emerging Engineering Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICANMEET.2013.6609358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICANMEET.2013.6609358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low complex real photonic OFDM for Radio-over-Fiber system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","OFDM","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","Fourier transforms","Hartley transforms","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real photonic OFDM","Radio-over-fiber system","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing","optical communication","subcarriers","trigonometric transforms","Fourier Transform","all-optical signal processing","RoF OFDM","modulation-demodulation","Fast Hartley Transform","Optisystem software","optical telecommunication","Wireless LAN","Fiber-To-Home","Wi-Max","4th generation cellular systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)","Discrete Hartley Transform (DHT)","Fast Hartley Transform (FHT)","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"A low complex real photonic OFDM for Radio-over-Fiber system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609358/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13798321","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low complex real photonic OFDM for Radio-over-Fiber system","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"XXIISN11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04817S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596024","isNumber":"6609218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596024","xplore-issue":"6609218","articleId":"6609358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6609382,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

This platform is composed of silicon nanotweezers to manipulate the biological samples and an open microfluidic to handle solution and reactive agents. The tweezers are fabricated by standard Silicon-On-Insulator based micromachining processes (2 masks +1 additional mask for special tips) and integrate actuator, trapping tips and sensor. The microfluidic device is produced from common polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micromolding and integrates active valves for controlling the biological medium. Combining both technologies, a versatile experimental setup, built up in an enclosed space (<; 10 cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n), enables direct interrogation of molecules or cells in solution. The silicon nanotweezers sense slight biological modifications of the trapped molecules or cell by monitoring the mechanical resonance response, which keeps a high Q factor (over 20) in liquid. Biomolecular assays (molecule trapping and enzymatic reaction kinetics) as well as characterizations of cells are reported here. The system provide molecular level resolution and is sensitive enough to capture cell biomechano-transduction activities. Moreover as the system is handy, it may be an easy, fast and quantitative alternative to existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609459","publicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596169/6609410/06609459.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated MEMS platform with silicon nanotweezers and open microfluidic device for real-time and routine biomechanical probing on molecules and cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609459/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated MEMS platform with silicon nanotweezers and open microfluidic device for real-time and routine biomechanical probing on molecules and cells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13812757","pubMedId":"24109646","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609459/","conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated MEMS platform with silicon nanotweezers and open microfluidic device for real-time and routine biomechanical probing on molecules and cells","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00382697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08105S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596169","isNumber":"6609410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596169","xplore-issue":"6609410","articleId":"6609459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6609584,"authors":[{"name":"Hasitha Muthumala Waidyasooriya","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hasitha Muthumala","lastName":"Waidyasooriya","id":"37704567800"},{"name":"Masanori Hariyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Hariyama","id":"37273494000"},{"name":"Michitaka Kameyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Michitaka","lastName":"Kameyama","id":"37273490500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0216-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"6609584","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"abstract":"The mapping of millions of short DNA fragments to a large genome is a great challenge in modern computational biology. Usually, it takes many hours or days to map a large genome using software. However, the recent progress of programmable hardware such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provides a cost effective solution to this challenge. FPGAs contain millions of programmable logic gates to design massively parallel accelerators. This paper proposes a hardware architecture to accelerate the short-read mapping using Burrows-Wheeler alignment. The speed-up of the proposed architecture is estimated to be at least 10 times compared to its equivalent software application.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596169/6609410/06609584.pdf","startPage":"651","endPage":"654","publicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a custom hardware-accelerator for short-read mapping using Burrows-Wheeler alignment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Software","Bandwidth","Hardware","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","computer software","DNA","field programmable gate arrays","genomics","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["custom hardware-accelerator","short-read mapping","burrows-wheeler alignment","DNA fragments","genomics","computational biology","software","programmable hardware","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","programmable logic gates","massive parallel accelerators","hardware architecture","equivalent software application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","short-read mapping","sequence alignment"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Automatic Data Processing","Base Sequence","Computers","High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","Humans","Sequence Alignment","Sequence Analysis, DNA","Software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a custom hardware-accelerator for short-read mapping using Burrows-Wheeler alignment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609584/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13813083","pubMedId":"24109771","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a custom hardware-accelerator for short-read mapping using Burrows-Wheeler alignment","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"01811671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06033S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596169","isNumber":"6609410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6609410","articleId":"6609584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6609586,"authors":[{"name":"Kelly Byron","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kelly","lastName":"Byron","id":"37075161200"},{"name":"Vlad Bluvshtein","affiliation":["Minnetronix, Inc., Saint Paul, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Vlad","lastName":"Bluvshtein","id":"37074921100"},{"name":"Lori Lucke","affiliation":["Minnetronix, Inc., Saint Paul, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Lori","lastName":"Lucke","id":"37352324900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0216-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"6609586","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609586","abstract":"Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) wirelessly transmit power through the skin. TETS is particularly desirable for ventricular assist devices (VAD), which currently require cables through the skin to power the implanted pump. Optimizing the inductive link of the TET system is a multi-parameter problem. Most current techniques to optimize the design simplify the problem by combining parameters leading to sub-optimal solutions. In this paper we present an optimization method using a genetic algorithm to handle a larger set of parameters, which leads to a more optimal design. Using this approach, we were able to increase efficiency while also reducing power variability in a prototype, compared to a traditional manual design method.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609586","startPage":"659","endPage":"662","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596169/6609410/06609586.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm optimization of transcutaneous energy transmission systems for implantable ventricular assist devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Couplings","Coils","Optimization","Prototypes","Manuals","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","prosthetic power supplies","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm optimization","transcutaneous energy transmission system","implantable ventricular assist device","wireless power transmission","skin","implanted pump","inductive link","TET system","suboptimal solution","optimization method","optimal design","power variability reduction","traditional manual design method"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Electric Power Supplies","Heart-Assist Devices","Humans","Models, Genetic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm optimization of transcutaneous energy transmission systems for implantable ventricular assist devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609586/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13812311","pubMedId":"24109773","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm optimization of transcutaneous energy transmission systems for implantable ventricular assist devices","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"01830590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046948S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596169","isNumber":"6609410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6609410","articleId":"6609586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6609608,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Liu","id":"38200994900"},{"name":"Lei Yao","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yao","id":"37574498200"},{"name":"Xiaodan Zou","affiliation":["Qualcomm CDMA Technologies Asia-Pacific Pte.

The IC consists of a low-noise neural amplifier, an AP detection circuit and an analog buffer with digital delay. The neural amplifier makes use of a current-reuse technique to maximize the transconductance efficiency for attaining a good noise efficiency factor. The AP detection circuit uses an adaptive threshold voltage to generate an enable signal for the subsequent functional blocks. The analog buffer with digital delay is employed using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter which preserves the AP waveform before the enable signal as well as provides low-pass filtering.

Both amplifier types employ the same operational-transconductance amplifier (OTA), which was fabricated in a 0.35um CMOS process.

Current devices do not seamlessly transition between modes such as level walking, stairs and slopes. The purpose of this study was to develop an intent recognition system and test its performance across five different modes. A Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) was used for classification of neural and mechanical signals while four amputees completed a circuit containing level-walking, ramp ascent, ramp descent, stair ascent and stair descent. Our results indicate that transitional and steady-state stair steps had a high recognition rate (>99%), while ramp steps were significantly more difficult to classify (p<;0.01) (13.7% error on transition steps and 1.3% on steady-state steps). With all five modes trained into the same system, the transitional error rate was 11.3%. Transitional error could be reduced by 31% by training the ramp ascent mode as level walking, and 92% by training both ramp ascent and descent as level walking. This is a viable solution when the level-walking mode can accommodate ramp modes which is currently the case with the ramp ascent. The high recognition rates for recognizing stairs shown in this study demonstrates the potential for an intent recognition system using neural information to allow amputees to naturally transition between locomotion modes on powered prostheses.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609818","publicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596169/6609410/06609818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609410","startPage":"1587","endPage":"1590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An intent recognition strategy for transfemoral amputee ambulation across different locomotion modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An intent recognition strategy for transfemoral amputee ambulation across different locomotion modes","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609818/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13812618","pubMedId":"24110005","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6609818/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An intent recognition strategy for transfemoral amputee ambulation across different locomotion modes","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"04160880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050189S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596169","isNumber":"6609410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596169","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6609410","articleId":"6609818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6609819,"authors":[{"name":"Koh Inoue","affiliation":["Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Koh","lastName":"Inoue","id":"38468804500"},{"name":"Hiroaki Hobara","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Hobara","id":"38468679300"},{"name":"Takahiro Wada","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatus, Siga, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Wada","id":"37329590300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0216-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"6609819","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Joints","Thigh","Knee","Hybrid fiber coaxial cables","Hip","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial properties effect","transfemoral prosthesis","leg swing motion","step-over-step gait","motor task","transfemoral amputation","foot placement effects","able-bodied subjects","full-foot contact","half-foot contact","ambulation strategies","inertial motion","stair ascent strategy","transfemoral amputees","stair ascent swing phase","joint moment","joint reaction force","simulated kinetic parameters"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Amputation","Amputees","Artificial Limbs","Biomechanical Phenomena","Femur","Gait","Humans","Joints","Knee Joint","Leg","Male","Movement","Prosthesis Design","Stress, Mechanical","Walking","Young Adult"]}],"abstract":"Stair ascent, especially the step-over-step gait, is a difficult motor task for people with transfemoral amputation. Our previous study demonstrated the effects of foot placement on the leg swing of able-bodied subjects. The study examined stair ascent with full-foot contact (FFC) and half-foot contact (HFC) as ambulation strategies. The results suggested that HFC causes the leg swing to have a greater inertial motion than FFC, as well as the applicability of the stair ascent strategy for transfemoral amputees with transfemoral prostheses without a motorized prosthetic knee joint. The present study investigated the effects of the inertial properties of a transfemoral prosthesis on leg motion during the stair ascent swing phase in simulation trials. The joint moment at the hip became smaller than that of an able-bodied subject. The peak values of the horizontal and vertical components of the joint reaction force were approximately the same as those of an able-bodied subject. These results suggest that a transfemoral prosthesis leg swing can be achieved with similar or smaller kinetic demand at the hip joint when half-foot contact on the stair steps is used as a stair ascent strategy. The mass had the largest effect of the inertial properties on the variability of the simulated kinetic parameters. The results of the present study may enhance prosthesis design with regard to the inertial properties and usability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of inertial properties of transfemoral prosthesis on leg swing motion during stair ascent","publicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609819","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596169/6609410/06609819.pdf","startPage":"1591","endPage":"1594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Effects of inertial properties of transfemoral prosthesis on leg swing motion during stair ascent","conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609819/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13813345","pubMedId":"24110006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of inertial properties of transfemoral prosthesis on leg swing motion during stair ascent","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"04171997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050977S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596169","isNumber":"6609410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6609410","articleId":"6609819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6609824,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Amine Miled","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed Amine","lastName":"Miled","id":"37423694200"},{"name":"Mohamad Sawan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Sawan","id":"37276702600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0216-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"}],"articleNumber":"6609824","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Glass","Packaging","Integrated circuit interconnections","CMOS integrated circuits","Dielectrophoresis","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological fluid dynamics","bioMEMS","CMOS integrated circuits","electrodes","lab-on-a-chip","particle separators","prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low voltage DEP microsystem","submicron particle manipulation","artificial cerebrospinal fluid","biochip","microparticle separation","nanoparticle separation","crossover frequency","electrode surface","CMOS chip","fast testing","prototyping","voltage 3.3 V","size 500 nm to 4 mum"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biosensing Techniques","Brain","Cerebrospinal Fluid","Computer Simulation","Dimethylpolysiloxanes","Electrodes","Equipment Design","Humans","Lab-On-A-Chip Devices","Microfluidic Analytical Techniques","Microspheres","Nanoparticles","Pressure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609824","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609824","publicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new low voltage biochip for micro and nanoparticle separation.

The described system in this work is focusing on the particle frequency dependent separation. Experimental results in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) show that each particle has its own crossover frequency. Thus based on the crossover frequency, particles are attracted to the electrode's surface, while others are pushed away. Five different particles are tested with different diameters in the range of 500 nm to 4 \u03bcm. All separation process is controlled by a CMOS chip fabricated using 0.18 \u03bcm technology from TSMC and powered with 3.3 V. Efficient particle separation is observed with low voltage, below 3.3V unlike other techniques in the range of kV. The proposed platform includes an advanced PDMS based assembly technique for fast testing and prototyping in addition to reconfigurable electrode architecture.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609410","startPage":"1611","endPage":"1614","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596169/6609410/06609824.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-voltage DEP microsystem for submicron particle manipulation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6609824/","displayDocTitle":"Low-voltage DEP microsystem for submicron particle manipulation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid","conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13812536","pubMedId":"24110011","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-voltage DEP microsystem for submicron particle manipulation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"04220831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072883S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596169","isNumber":"6609410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596169","xplore-issue":"6609410","articleId":"6609824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6609832,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Ping Shen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.

It is the best suitable candidate to develop a simplified screening technique for the management of respiratory diseases in timely manner, both in developing and developed countries, particularly in remote areas where medical facilities are limited. However, major issue hindering the development is the non-availability of reliable technique to automatically identify cough events. Medical practitioners still rely on manual counting, which is laborious and time consuming. In this paper we propose a novel method, based on the neural network to automatically identify cough segments, discarding other sounds such a speech, ambient noise etc. We achieved the accuracy of 98% in classifying 13395 segments into two classes, `cough' and `other sounds', with the sensitivity of 93.44% and specificity of 94.52%. Our preliminary results indicate that method can develop into a real-time cough identification technique in continuous cough monitoring systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual

VLSI design of fast singular value decomposition (SVD) processor for real-time electroencephalography (EEG) system based on on-line recursive independent component analysis (ORICA). Since SVD is used frequently in computations of the real-time EEG system, a low-latency and high-accuracy SVD processor is essential. During the EEG system process, the proposed SVD processor aims to solve the diagonal, inverse and inverse square root matrices of the target matrices in real time. Generally, SVD requires a huge amount of computation in hardware implementation. Therefore, this work proposes a novel design concept for data flow updating to assist the pipeline VLSI implementation. The SVD processor can greatly improve the feasibility of real-time EEG system applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). The proposed architecture is implemented using TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology. The sample rate of EEG raw data adopts 128 Hz. The core size of the SVD processor is 580\u00d7580 um\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and the speed of operation frequency is 20MHz. It consumes 0.774mW of power during the 8-channel EEG system per execution time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609908","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609908","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596169/6609410/06609908.pdf","startPage":"1944","endPage":"1947","publicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pipeline VLSI design of fast singular value decomposition processor for real-time EEG system based on on-line recursive independent component analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A pipeline VLSI design of fast singular value decomposition processor for real-time EEG system based on on-line recursive independent component analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2013","conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13812840","pubMedId":"24110095","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6609908/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pipeline VLSI design of fast singular value decomposition processor for real-time EEG system based on on-line recursive independent component analysis","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"05201414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063961S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596169","isNumber":"6609410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6609410","articleId":"6609908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6609996,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos A.

These data are prone to movement artifacts, especially in infants who move or need to be handled often. Therefore segments of PPG data contaminated by movement artifact must be detected as a first stage of analysis. In ACS this identification is generally done manually, by having an expert visually assess the quality of the signal. This is subjective and very time consuming, especially for long data records. For this reason we present a novel detector of PPG movement artifacts that uses moving average filters to remove trends, reduce the effect of white noise, and notch filter pulse-related information. The normalized root mean square of the filtered signal is then used as a detection statistic. We demonstrate its detection properties using a data set from infants recovering from anesthesia, and show that it performs better than other automated methods based on entropy or higher-order statistics. Furthermore, the new method is more robust than the other methods in the presence of large noise.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609996","publicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596169/6609410/06609996.pdf","startPage":"2295","endPage":"2299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new movement artifact detector for photoplethysmographic signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6609996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6609996/","displayDocTitle":"A new movement artifact detector for photoplethysmographic signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13812537","pubMedId":"24110183","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6609996/","conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new movement artifact detector for photoplethysmographic signals","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"06081514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069035S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596169","isNumber":"6609410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596169","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6609410","articleId":"6609996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"}]
