To match the impedance of the sensor and the coaxial transmission line, a kind of micro strip impedance transformer which is of an exponentially gradual type is designed, the parameters of which are defined through simulation. Two improvement schemes for the designed transformer are also proposed to make an easy package and installation for the sensor and the transformer. Then, the physical model is made and tested.

The linear systems are obtained by multiple linearisations at points spread across a training trajectory. The points have to be judiciously selected, as the quality of approximation and complexity of the reduced order model is dependant on them. In this work, limitations of the previous schemes used for linearisation point selection are pointed out and areas of improvement are identified. A new strategy, based on the insights gained from a study of the previous ones is suggested. The new method is an innovative way to identify parts of the nonlinear system trajectory where more linearisation points are needed or redundant ones have been formed. It is based on a new error measure, indicative of how well a linear system represents the nonlinear system evolution in its neighbourhood. Additionally, it requires no new information about the nonlinear system and gives considerably improved results without increasing the computational burden.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260100","publicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2012

First, some characteristics of the hyperspectral remotely sensed data, such as high correlation, high redundancy, etc., are investigated. Based on the above analysis, we propose to use the principal component analysis to capture the main information existing in the hyperspectral images and reduce its dimensionality consequently. Next, we use neural networks to classify the reduced hyperspectral data. Since the back-propagation neural network we used is easy to suffer from the local minimum problem, we adopt a genetic algorithm to optimize the BP network's weights and the threshold. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy is improved and the time of calculation is reduced as well.","doi":"10.1109/RSETE.2012.6260384","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 2nd International Conference on Remote Sensing, Environment and Transportation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257549/6260340/06260384.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 2nd International Conference on Remote Sensing, Environment and Transportation Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSETE.2012.6260384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Hyperspectral Classification Algorithm Based on Back-Propagation Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Biological neural networks","Principal component analysis","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image classification","neural nets","principal component analysis","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral classification algorithm","back-propagation neural networks","hyperspectral image classification","principal component analysis","genetic algorithm","artificial neural networks","hyperspectral remotely sensed data","BP network optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Hyperspectral Classification Algorithm Based on Back-Propagation Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6260384/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12931707","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Hyperspectral Classification Algorithm Based on Back-Propagation Neural Networks","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04931S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257549","isNumber":"6260340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257549","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6260340","articleId":"6260384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6260446,"authors":[{"name":"Aylin Turhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Turhan","id":"38467328900"},{"name":"Murat Alanyali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Alanyali","id":"37283096100"},{"name":"David Starobinski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Starobinski","id":"37265040200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-45-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2294-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-47-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6260446","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","Markov processes","Equations","Computational modeling","Dynamic programming","Aerospace electronics","Ad hoc networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260446","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","abstract":"We study optimal admission control of secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio (CR) networks in presence of preemption. In this model, when a primary user (PU) arrives to the system and finds all the channels busy, it preempts an SU unless all the users in the system are PUs. We apply admission control on the SUs only. Using dynamic programming (DP), we find the optimal admission control policy that maximizes the long-run average profit. As our main contribution, we show that the optimal admission control of the SUs depends only on the total number of users in the system (i.e. it does not depend on the number of PUs and SUs in the system individually) and is of threshold type. Therefore, although the system is modeled as a two-dimensional Markov chain, our findings allow simple and efficient computation of the optimal control policy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260438","startPage":"138","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247524/6260438/06260446.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal admission control of secondary users in preemptive cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6260446/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal admission control of secondary users in preemptive cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"14-18 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal admission control of secondary users in preemptive cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Paderborn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p138turhan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055869S","chronDate":"14-18 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247524","isNumber":"6260438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247524","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6260438","articleId":"6260446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6260448,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed M.

We consider an overlay secondary network employing a random access scheme in which secondary users access the channel by certain access probabilities that are function of the spectrum sensing metric. In setting our problem, we assume that secondary users can eavesdrop on the primary link's feedback. We study the cognitive radio network from a queuing theory point of view. Access probabilities are determined by solving a secondary throughput maximization problem subject to a constraint on the primary queues' stability. First, we formulate our problem which is found to be non-convex. Yet, we solve it efficiently by exploiting the structure of the secondary throughput equation. Our scheme yields improved results in, both, the secondary user throughput and the primary user packet delay. In addition, it comes very close to the optimal genie-aided scheme in which secondary users act upon the presumed perfect knowledge of the primary user's activity\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6260448/","conferenceDate":"14-18 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A soft sensing-based cognitive access scheme exploiting primary feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A soft sensing-based cognitive access scheme exploiting primary feedback","confLoc":"Paderborn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p153arafa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066595S","chronDate":"14-18 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247524","isNumber":"6260438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247524","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6260438","articleId":"6260448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6260450,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyue Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Dongyue","lastName":"Xue","id":"37722173400"},{"name":"Eylem Ekici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Eylem","lastName":"Ekici","id":"37265480800"},{"name":"Mehmet C.

The aim is to compute the scheduling policy to determine which actions to choose at each time slot in order to maximize the expected total discounted reward. We first establish the threshold structure of the optimal policy when the underlying channel statistics are known. We then consider the more challenging case when the statistics are unknown. For this problem, we map different threshold policies to arms of a suitably defined multiarmed bandit problem.

We conducted high precision latency measurements in operational LTE and HSPA networks, deploying a hybrid approach of active probing and withe-box testing. It allowed us to separately assess the one-way delay contributions of the radio access network and the core network for both technologies. The results show that LTE outperforms HSPA in the case of medium to high data rates. However, due to differences in the radio access procedures, the HSPA uplink connection offers lower delay for specific traffic patterns. A comparison between our measurement results and the requirements for delay sensitive applications exhibits that LTE is not (yet) the generally preferable technology. Hence, further optimizations of the LTE scheduling and resource allocation policies are required to fully exhaust all feasible latency improvements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Probes","Downlink","Mobile communication","IP networks","Radio access networks","Synchronization"]}],"publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247524/6260438/06260469.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison between one-way delays in operating HSPA and LTE networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison between one-way delays in operating HSPA and LTE networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260469/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6260469/","conferenceDate":"14-18 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison between one-way delays in operating HSPA and LTE networks","confLoc":"Paderborn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p286laner.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079541S","chronDate":"14-18 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247524","isNumber":"6260438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247524","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6260438","articleId":"6260469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6260473,"authors":[{"name":"Karina Gomez","affiliation":["CREATE-NET International Research Institute, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Karina","lastName":"Gomez","id":"37582051600"},{"name":"Roberto Riggio","affiliation":["CREATE-NET International Research Institute, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Riggio","id":"37391696200"},{"name":"Tinku Rasheed","affiliation":["CREATE-NET International Research Institute, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Tinku","lastName":"Rasheed","id":"37297065900"},{"name":"Daniele Miorandi","affiliation":["CREATE-NET International Research Institute, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Miorandi","id":"37283245800"},{"name":"Fabrizio Granelli","affiliation":["University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Granelli","id":"37283745900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-45-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2294-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-47-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6260473","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":861},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Monitoring","Energy consumption","Wireless networks","Sensors","Transmitters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy consumption monitoring","hardware","software","wireless","testbed","arduino"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260473","abstract":"Accurate measurement of energy consumption of practical wireless deployments is vital to the research community to develop pragmatic simulators and analytical models for the synthesis of new energy-aware and energy-efficient protocols and algorithms for wireless networks.

Further, these results are used to obtain tight upper and lower bounds for the success probability at the PU; defined as the probability that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is beyond a certain operating threshold.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260438","startPage":"349","endPage":"354","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247524/6260438/06260481.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference characteristics and success probability at the primary user in a cognitive radio network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6260481/","displayDocTitle":"Interference characteristics and success probability at the primary user in a cognitive radio network","conferenceDate":"14-18 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference characteristics and success probability at the primary user in a cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Paderborn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p349madhusudhanan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091485S","chronDate":"14-18 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247524","isNumber":"6260438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247524","xplore-issue":"6260438","articleId":"6260481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6260486,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Hoydis","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, Sup\u00e9lec, France"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Hoydis","id":"37573341600"},{"name":"Axel M\u00fcller","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, Sup\u00e9lec, France"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"38467764200"},{"name":"Romain Couillet","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, Sup\u00e9lec, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Couillet","id":"37546137300"},{"name":"M\u00e9rouane Debbah","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, Sup\u00e9lec, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9rouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-45-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2294-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-47-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6260486","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Analytical models","Equations","Irrigation"]}],"abstract":"We consider the uplink of a one-dimensional 2-cell network with fixed base stations (BSs) and randomly distributed user terminals (UTs).

However, their deployment is nontrivial because of the extra interference that the femtocell nodes cause to the macrocell nodes with which they share the same portion of the spectrum. This paper proposes a non-cooperative power control approach for interference mitigation in a two-tier femtocell network where the first tier is a conventional cellular network and the second tier is a set of (short-range) femtocells. We define objective functions that are different for Femtocell Mobile Nodes (FMNs) and macrocell Mobile Nodes (MNs). We then define a power control game, we prove the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) for that game and we analyze the necessary and sufficient conditions so that the NE is unique. Based on the best response dynamics method, we propose a distributed iterative power control scheme that, starting from any initial power vector, converges to that NE. We simulate various scenarios that are based on realistic assumptions and topologies. Results show that, in many cases, in the NE, smooth coexistence of all entities of the topology is feasible.","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247524/6260438/06260490.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260438","startPage":"398","endPage":"405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control under best response dynamics for interference mitigation in a two-tier femtocell network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power control under best response dynamics for interference mitigation in a two-tier femtocell network","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260490/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6260490/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control under best response dynamics for interference mitigation in a two-tier femtocell network","confLoc":"Paderborn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p398douros.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096243S","chronDate":"14-18 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247524","isNumber":"6260438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247524","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6260438","articleId":"6260490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6260494,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey Garnaev","affiliation":["St. Petersburg State University, Russia"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Garnaev","id":"37545521500"},{"name":"Yezekael Hayel","affiliation":["University of Avignon, France"],"firstName":"Yezekael","lastName":"Hayel","id":"37282414400"},{"name":"Eitan Altman","affiliation":["INRIA, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Eitan","lastName":"Altman","id":"37266347900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-45-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2294-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-47-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6260494","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Transmitters","Games","Fading","Bayesian methods","Interference","Signal to noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"The goal of this paper is to investigate how incomplete information on the fading channel gains impacts transmission parameters.

The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg (leader-follower) game where first the PO sets the network subscription price to maximize its revenue. Then, users perform the network selection process, deciding whether to pay for having a guaranteed service, or use a cheaper, best-effort secondary network, where congestion and low throughput may be experienced. Such process is modeled as a population game to study the strategic interactions among a large number of agents. For our pricing and network selection game, we provide equilibrium and convergence properties, and derive optimal stable price and network selection settings. Numerical results illustrate that our game model captures the main factors behind cognitive network pricing and channel selection, thus representing a promising framework for the design and understanding of cognitive radio systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247524/6260438/06260501.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260438","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","startPage":"49","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint pricing and cognitive radio network selection: A game theoretical approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint pricing and cognitive radio network selection: A game theoretical approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260501/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6260501/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","conferenceDate":"14-18 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint pricing and cognitive radio network selection: A game theoretical approach","confLoc":"Paderborn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p49elias.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092215S","chronDate":"14-18 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247524","isNumber":"6260438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247524","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6260438","articleId":"6260501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6260504,"authors":[{"name":"Sanaz Barghi","affiliation":["Departmentartment of EECS, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Sanaz","lastName":"Barghi","id":"37542471000"},{"name":"Amir Khojastepour","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Khojastepour","id":"38234792500"},{"name":"Karthik Sundaresan","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Sundaresan","id":"37274483000"},{"name":"Sampath Rangarajan","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Sampath","lastName":"Rangarajan","id":"37282909600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-45-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2294-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-47-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6260504","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":681},"abstract":"Using additional antennas and signal processing techniques to build a full-duplex radio is becoming a popular topic in the networking research community. However, additional antennas are used for MIMO (multiple input multiple output) transmissions, traditionally, and it is well-known that increasing the number of antennas on either transmitter or receiver side increases the MIMO link capacity. Therefore, deployment of extra antennas on a transceiver has twofold applications, first increasing the capacity of half-duplex MIMO link, second providing full-duplex capability for the radio. In this work, we look at the performance comparison between using multiple-antennas for capacity enhancement in a half-duplex MIMO link with that of utilizing them to build a full-duplex radio. Our results indicate that under certain conditions, using additional antennas for building full-duplex radio can provide performance boost compared to utilizing them to form a high capacity MIMO link.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247524/6260438/06260504.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"74","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing the throughput gain of single cell MIMO wireless systems with full duplex radios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Radio frequency","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Downlink"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing the throughput gain of single cell MIMO wireless systems with full duplex radios","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6260504/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","conferenceDate":"14-18 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing the throughput gain of single cell MIMO wireless systems with full duplex radios","confLoc":"Paderborn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p68barghi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036749S","chronDate":"14-18 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247524","isNumber":"6260438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247524","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6260438","articleId":"6260504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6260505,"authors":[{"name":"Sumudu Samarakoon","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Sumudu","lastName":"Samarakoon","id":"38467989600"},{"name":"Mehdi Bennis","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bennis","id":"37299803500"},{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Saad","id":"37392237900"},{"name":"Matti Latva-aho","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-aho","id":"37270610400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-45-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2294-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-47-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6260505","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Wireless communication","Games","Interference","Macrocell networks","Ad hoc networks","Resource management"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop novel two-tier interference management strategies that enable macrocell users (MUEs) to improve their performance, with the help of open-access femtocells. To this end, we propose a rate-splitting technique using which the MUEs optimize their uplink transmissions by dividing their signals into two types: a coarse message that is intended for direct transmission to the macrocell base station and a fine message that is decoded by a neighboring femtocell and subsequently relayed over a heterogeneous (wireless/wired) backhaul. For deploying the proposed technique, we formulate a non-cooperative game between the MUEs in which each MUE can decide on its relaying femtocell while maximizing a utility function that captures both the achieved throughput and the expected backhaul delay. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields up to 125% rate improvement and up to 2 times delay reduction with wired backhaul and, 150% rate improvement and up to 10 times delay reduction with wireless backhaul, relative to classical interference management approaches, with no cross-tier cooperation.","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247524/6260438/06260505.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling relaying over heterogeneous backhauls in the uplink of femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260505/","displayDocTitle":"Enabling relaying over heterogeneous backhauls in the uplink of femtocell networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6260505/","conferenceDate":"14-18 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling relaying over heterogeneous backhauls in the uplink of femtocell networks","confLoc":"Paderborn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p75samarakoon.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059012S","chronDate":"14-18 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247524","isNumber":"6260438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247524","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6260438","articleId":"6260505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6260600,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Liu","affiliation":["Basic Science School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Liu","id":"38467465300"},{"name":"Guangmin Wu","affiliation":["Basic Science School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Guangmin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37403455000"},{"name":"Jianming Chen","affiliation":["Basic Science School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406658600"},{"name":"Guoqiong Zhou","affiliation":["Basic Science School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Guoqiong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37593409900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0875-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0872-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0874-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6260600","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260600","abstract":"The responses of neural networks for uniform and normal distribution are studied, especially the BP and RBF neural networks and the question of combination between neural networks and fuzzy logical is answered by experiments.

Packets are organized into flows based on a set of packet header fields and a predefined rule is applied on the packets in each flow to filter malicious network traffic. This is realized using packet classification, which is implemented in secure networking environments where mere best-effort delivery of packets is not adequate. Existing packet classification solutions are highly dependent on the properties (or features) of the ruleset. We present a bit vector based lookup scheme and a parallel hardware architecture that does not rely on ruleset features. A detailed performance analysis of the proposed scheme is given under different configurations. Post place-and-route results of our parallel pipelined architecture on a state-of-the-art Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device shows that for real-life firewall rulesets, the proposed solution achieves 400G+ throughput. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first packet classification engine that achieves 400G+ rate on a single FPGA. Further, on the average we achieve 2.5\u00d7 power efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"StrideBV: Single chip 400G+ packet classification","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2012.6260820","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6249799/6260814/06260820.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2012.6260820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"StrideBV: Single chip 400G+ packet classification","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6260820/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12911154","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"StrideBV: Single chip 400G+ packet classification","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"061569565333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117151S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6249799","isNumber":"6260814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6249799","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6260814","articleId":"6260820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6260830,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Qu","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Qu","id":"38236293200"},{"name":"Yi-Hua E.

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets. Post-place-and-route results show that when 8 characters are matched per cycle, our design can achieve 180 MHz clock rate, leading to a throughput of 11.8 Gbps.","doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2012.6260830","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6249799/6260814/06260830.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2012.6260830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale multi-flow regular expression matching on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260830/","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale multi-flow regular expression matching on FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6260830/","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12911164","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale multi-flow regular expression matching on FPGA","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"161569569281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055031S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6249799","isNumber":"6260814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6249799","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6260814","articleId":"6260830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6260835,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil M.

For actuation of the valve the membrane was deflected by externally applied magnetic force which can close either of the channels. The flow manipulation and proper operation of the valve depends on thickness and percentage loading of magnetic material in membrane as well as dimensions of channel, chamber and membrane with respect to the location of outlet channels. The microfluidic channel was completely close for any fluid flow rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6260969/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Magnetically controlled flexible valve for flow manipulation in polymer microfluidic devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetically controlled flexible valve for flow manipulation in polymer microfluidic devices","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085297S","chronDate":"7-10 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6248434","isNumber":"6260860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6248434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6260860","articleId":"6260969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6260993,"authors":[{"name":"Lijuan Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Lijuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"38248087500"},{"name":"Jun Shen","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shen","id":"37279547000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3048-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4757-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-7703"}],"articleNumber":"6260993","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information management","Data handling","Data storage systems","Quality of service","Cloud computing","Biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocomputing","data handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired cost minimisation","data-intensive service provision","digital information","big data","automatic business process","biological systems","autonomy","scalability","adaptability","robustness","service oriented systems","optimal data service solution","data management","service maintenance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["service provision","data-intensive","large-scale service computing","bio-inspired algorithms","cloud computing","Big Data","QoS"]}],"abstract":"The world is filled with an unimaginably vast amount of digital information which is getting even vaster and even growing more rapidly. The enormous new data is impacting every area of our society. The real strategic value of the data can determine what will happen and what can be discovered in the future. To better use the so called \"Big Data\", automatic business process or workflow is needed to process large quantity of data. Biological systems present fascinating features, such as autonomy, scalability, adaptability, and robustness. The bio-inspired concepts and mechanisms have been successfully applied to service oriented systems. In this study, by reviewing a number of studies which applied biological concepts and principles to solve problems of service provision, we proposed a bio-inspired cost minimisation mechanism for data-intensive service provision. It utilizes bio-inspired mechanisms to search and find the optimal data service solution considering cost of data management and service maintenance. The newly composed data-intensive service will be a timely contribution to \"Big Data\" research.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Bio-inspired Cost Minimisation for Data-Intensive Service Provision","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE First International Conference on Services Economics","doi":"10.1109/SE.2012.14","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE First International Conference on Services Economics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260983/6260984/06260993.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SE.2012.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6260984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6260993","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6260993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Towards Bio-inspired Cost Minimisation for Data-Intensive Service Provision","conferenceDate":"24-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6260993/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12911728","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Bio-inspired Cost Minimisation for Data-Intensive Service Provision","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4757a016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095462S","chronDate":"24-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260983","isNumber":"6260984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260983","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6260984","articleId":"6260993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6261019,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hamdi","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hamdi","id":"37272053600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1382-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1380-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6261019","dbTime":"62 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4544},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Security","Computer architecture","Privacy","Computational modeling","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing security","cloud architectures","pervasive computing","scientific computing","business computing","cloud infrastructures","protection mechanisms","mobile devices","cloud based infrastructures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing security","risk analysis","distributed attacks and threats","software and data isolation"]}],"abstract":"Convergence and ubiquity are the key characteristics of tomorrows service provision infrastructures. Cloud architectures will constitute cost-efficient backbones that will support the transmission, storage, and computing of the applications contents. These architectures can be used for business, scientific, and pervasive computing purposes.

The cost and complexity reduction requirements render the design and development of protection mechanisms even more challenging. In addition, key design features such as confidentiality, privacy, authentication, anonymity, survivability, dependability, and fault-tolerance are, in some extent, conflicting.

These promote the elastic nature of cloud platform but force upon significant challenges to cloud service providers. Particularly, security issues such as inconsistency may arise while dynamic changes such as virtual machine migration occur. In this paper, we propose a formal framework for the specification of virtual machines migration and security policies updates. This framework enables us to verify that the global security policy after the migration is consistently preserved with respect to the initial one. To this end, we define a new calculus, namely cloud calculus that can be used to specify the topology of a cloud computing system and firewall security rules. It also enables specifying the virtual machines migration along with their security policies. The semantics of our calculus is based on structural congruence and a reduction relation. In order to verify the global security policy within the new configuration, we define a testing equivalence over cloud terms. Finally, we provide an illustrative case study to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2012.6261089","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247135/6261004/06261089.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2012.6261089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261004","startPage":"447","endPage":"454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud calculus: Security verification in elastic cloud computing platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cloud calculus: Security verification in elastic cloud computing platform","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261089/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6261089/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud calculus: Security verification in elastic cloud computing platform","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112816S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247135","isNumber":"6261004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247135","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6261004","articleId":"6261089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6261097,"authors":[{"name":"Mu-Hsing Kuo","affiliation":["School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mu-Hsing","lastName":"Kuo","id":"38236205300"},{"name":"Andre Kushniruk","affiliation":["School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Kushniruk","id":"37564710800"},{"name":"Elizabeth Borycki","affiliation":["School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Borycki","id":"38278144900"},{"name":"Feipei Lai","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Biomedical, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Feipei","lastName":"Lai","id":"37279108700"},{"name":"Sarangerel Dorjgochoo","affiliation":["Computer Science & Management School, Mongolian University of Science and Technology, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia"],"firstName":"Sarangerel","lastName":"Dorjgochoo","id":"37698315400"},{"name":"Erdenebaatar Altangerel","affiliation":["Computer Science & Management School, Mongolian University of Science and Technology, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia"],"firstName":"Erdenebaatar","lastName":"Altangerel","id":"37075930100"},{"name":"Chinburen Jigjidsuren","affiliation":["Department of Hepatobiliary-pancreatic Surgery, Mongolian National Cancer Center, Mongolia"],"firstName":"Chinburen","lastName":"Jigjidsuren","id":"37086736886"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1382-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1381-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1380-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6261097","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Cancer","Data mining","Security","Bioinformatics","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Healthcare Data Sharing","Data Mining","Collaborative Research","Service-Oriented Architecture"]}],"abstract":"The aim of this paper is to propose a cloud-based data mining (DM) platform for researchers in three different geographic locations (Canada, Taiwan and Mongolia) for sharing research data/results through the Internet while remaining cost effective, flexible, secure and privacy-preserved.

Therefore, SRAM's robustness is considered crucial to guarantee the reliability of such SoCs over lifetime. In this context, one of the most important phenomena degrading nano-scale SRAMs reliability is related to Negative-Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI). This paper proposes a new approach based on an On-Chip Aging Sensor (OCAS) to detect SRAM aging during system lifetime. The sensor is able to detect any specific aging state of a cell in the SRAM array. The strategy is based on the connection of an OCAS per SRAM column, which periodically performs off-line testing by monitoring write operations into the SRAM cells to detect aging. The approach is application-transparent since it is does not change the SRAM contents after testing. To prevent OCAS from aging by one side and from dissipating static power by the other side, OCAS circuitry is powered-off during idle periods. SPICE simulations in a 65nm CMOS technology demonstrate the high sensor sensitivity to detect early aging states and so, guarantying high memory reliability. Furthermore, area overhead due to sensor insertion is almost negligible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6261238/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investigating the use of an on-chip sensor to monitor NBTI effect in SRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating the use of an on-chip sensor to monitor NBTI effect in SRAM","confLoc":"Quito, Ecuador","sourcePdf":"latw1211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077113S","chronDate":"10-13 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247526","isNumber":"6261223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247526","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6261223","articleId":"6261238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-06"},{"_id":6261241,"authors":[{"name":"J.-H.

Transient and DC (Direct Current) analysis are performed in differential and inverter stages of a simple two-stage operational amplifier. The linearity and voltage swing of both amplifier stages are evaluated, as well as, the effects on the bias current and the output offset voltage. Simulation results show that the NMOS differential amplifier architecture may have an improved robustness in radiation environments, if compared to its PMOS counterpart, when considering the typical behavior of MOS transistors under radiation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOS devices","Transistors","MOSFET circuits","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TID (Total Ionizing Dose)","threshold voltage deviation","radiation effects","analog building-blocks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LATW.2012.6261255","publicationTitle":"2012 13th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 13th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247526/6261223/06261255.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATW.2012.6261255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of TID-induced threshold deviations in analog building-blocks of operational amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of TID-induced threshold deviations in analog building-blocks of operational amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261255/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261255/","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 April 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of TID-induced threshold deviations in analog building-blocks of operational amplifiers","confLoc":"Quito, Ecuador","sourcePdf":"latw1228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046985S","chronDate":"10-13 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247526","isNumber":"6261223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247526","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6261223","articleId":"6261255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6261262,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel N.

Multiple faults induced by single event effects are expected to be seen more often. Thus, reliability has become an important design criterion. In this context we introduce a cost-aware methodology for selective hardening of combinational logic cells. The methodology is based on the SPRA algorithm for calculating logical masking, and it is capable to automatically perform a trade-off between reliability improvements and associated costs, providing a list of the most effective candidates for hardening. The methodology is applied to a set of benchmark circuits using costs extracted from an actual standard cell library. The results then show that the methodology is able to diminish the unreliability of circuits in a cost-effective manner.","doi":"10.1109/LATW.2012.6261262","publicationTitle":"2012 13th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 13th Latin American Test Workshop (LATW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247526/6261223/06261262.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATW.2012.6261262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective hardening methodology for combinational logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 April 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261262/","displayDocTitle":"Selective hardening methodology for combinational logic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261262/","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective hardening methodology for combinational logic","confLoc":"Quito, Ecuador","sourcePdf":"latw1235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053633S","chronDate":"10-13 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247526","isNumber":"6261223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247526","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6261223","articleId":"6261262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6261263,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For this, a new dataset is introduced, together with a detailed description of the process that was followed to create it. Important phenomena such as correlations between different affective dimensions and intercoder agreement are thoroughly discussed and analyzed. Various methodologies for automatically predicting those states are also presented and evaluated.

However, a fundamental question arises: Why would licensed primary users of a spectrum band allow secondary users to share the band and degrade performance for them? And how can we design incentive schemes to enable spectrum sharing using cooperative communication schemes? We consider a principal-agent framework, and propose a contracts-based approach. First, a single primary and a single secondary transmitter-receiver pair with a Gaussian interference channel between them are considered. The two users may contract to cooperate in doing successive-interference cancellation. Under full information, we give equilibrium contracts for various channel conditions. These equilibrium contracts yield Pareto-optimal rate allocations when physically possible. We then allow for time-sharing and observe that in equilibrium contracts there is no actual time-sharing. We show that the designed contracts can be made robust to deviation by either user post-contract. We also show how these can be extended to multiple secondary users. We show that under hidden information, when the primary user has a dominant role, neither user has an incentive to lie about their direct channel coefficients, or manipulate the cross channel measurements, and Pareto-optimal outcomes are achieved at equilibrium.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","accessionNumber":"13707251","htmlLink":"/document/6261316/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sharing through Contracts for Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sharing through Contracts for Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"ttm2013101999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047874S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","isNumber":"6583168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"24","articleId":"6261316","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6261323,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/6303808/6261323/6261323-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Sun received the BS degree from Beijing Jiaotong University in 1992, the MS and PhD degrees from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 1999, and 2007, respectively.

In this paper, we jointly consider data aggregation, information trust, and fault tolerance to enhance the correctness and trustworthiness of collected information. Based on the multilayer aggregation architecture of WMSNs, we design a trust-based framework for data aggregation with fault tolerance with a goal to reduce the impact of erroneous data and provide measurable trustworthiness for aggregated results. By extracting statistical characteristics from different sources and extending Josang's trust model, we propose how to compute self-data trust opinion, peer node trust opinion, and peer data trust opinion. According to the trust transfer and trust combination rules designed in our framework, we derive the trust opinion of the sink node on the final aggregated result. In particular, this framework can evaluate both discrete data and continuous media streams in WMSNs through a uniform mechanism. Results obtained from both simulation study and experiments on a real WMSN testbed demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our framework, which can significantly improve the quality of multimedia information as well as more precisely evaluate the trustworthiness of collected information.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261323","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Wireless sensor networks","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","multimedia communication","security of data","statistical analysis","telecommunication computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant data aggregation","wireless multimedia sensor networks","noisy environments","unattended environments","multilayer aggregation architecture","statistical characteristics","Josang trust model","self-data trust opinion","peer node trust opinion","peer data trust opinion","trust transfer","sink node","discrete data","continuous media streams","uniform mechanism","real WMSN testbed","multimedia information quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless multimedia sensor networks","trust","data aggregation","fault tolerance"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/6303808/06261323.pdf","startPage":"785","endPage":"797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6303808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2012.68","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2012.68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Trust-Based Framework for Fault-Tolerant Data Aggregation in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261323/","displayDocTitle":"A Trust-Based Framework for Fault-Tolerant Data Aggregation in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2012","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"12996659","htmlLink":"/document/6261323/","volume":"9","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trust-Based Framework for Fault-Tolerant Data Aggregation in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttq2012060785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091208S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"6303808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6303808","articleId":"6261323","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6261327,"authors":[{"name":"Jifeng Xuan","affiliation":["School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/6311391/6261327/6261327-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jifeng Xuan received the BSc degree in software engineering from Dalian University of Technology, China, in 2007.

The research on the NRP is restricted by the growing scale of requirements. In this paper, we propose a Backbone-based Multilevel Algorithm (BMA) to address the large scale NRP. In contrast to direct solving approaches, the BMA employs multilevel reductions to downgrade the problem scale and multilevel refinements to construct the final optimal set of customers. In both reductions and refinements, the backbone is built to fix the common part of the optimal customers. Since it is intractable to extract the backbone in practice, the approximate backbone is employed for the instance reduction while the soft backbone is proposed to augment the backbone application. In the experiments, to cope with the lack of open large requirements databases, we propose a method to extract instances from open bug repositories. Experimental results on 15 classic instances and 24 realistic instances demonstrate that the BMA can achieve better solutions on the large scale NRP instances than direct solving approaches. Our work provides a reduction approach for solving large scale problems in search-based requirements engineering.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2011.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311391","startPage":"1195","endPage":"1212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/6311391/06261327.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving the Large Scale Next Release Problem with a Backbone-Based Multilevel Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6261327/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solving the Large Scale Next Release Problem with a Backbone-Based Multilevel Algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13029396","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving the Large Scale Next Release Problem with a Backbone-Based Multilevel Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tts2012051195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160475S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"6311391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6311391","articleId":"6261327","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6261329,"authors":[{"name":"Ammar Zafar","affiliation":["EE Program, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ammar","lastName":"Zafar","id":"38246801200"},{"name":"Redha M.

In the energy-efficiency problem, the total power consumed is minimized while keeping the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) above a certain threshold. In the dual problem of power allocation, the end-to-end SNR is maximized under individual and global power constraints. Closed-form expressions for the optimal source and relay powers and the Lagrangian multiplier are obtained.

The relay nodes perform linear combinations by using network coding to form network-coded symbols and send them to the destination node. At the destination, a graph-based, rateless code is formed on the fly. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of an analytical symbol error rate (SER) bound for the proposed coding scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Wireless sensor networks","Fading","Network coding","Encoding","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","transform coding","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","distributed network coding","digital fountain rateless LT codes","source nodes","single destination node","relay nodes","two-hop fashion","linear combinations","network-coded symbols","graph-based code","analytical symbol error rate","Luby-transform codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","distributed network coding","network coded cooperation","network-on-graph","rateless codes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.080112.120465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6376570/06261334.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.080112.120465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Network Coding for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Rateless LT Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Network Coding for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Rateless LT Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261334/","volume":"1","issue":"6","publicationDate":"December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261334/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13167855","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Network Coding for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Rateless LT Codes","sourcePdf":"561-wcl1212-pang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05453S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6376570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6376570","articleId":"6261334","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6261513,"authors":[{"name":"Anthea Wain Sy Au","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6583168/6261513/6261513-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anthea Wain Sy Au received the bachelor's degree in engineering science from the University of Toronto in 2008 and the master's degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, in 2010."]},"firstName":"Anthea Wain Sy","lastName":"Au","id":"37073262600"},{"name":"Chen Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6583168/6261513/6261513-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Feng received the bachelor's degree and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

In the system, the location determination problem is solved by first applying a proximity constraint to limit the distance between a coarse estimate of the current position and a previous estimate. Then, a Compressive Sensing-based (CS--based) positioning scheme, proposed in our previous work , , is applied to obtain a refined position estimate. The refined estimate is used with a map-adaptive Kalman filter, which assumes a linear motion between intersections on a map that describes the user's path, to obtain a more robust position estimate. Experimental results with the system that is implemented on a PDA with limited resources (HP iPAQ hx2750 PDA) show that the proposed tracking system outperforms the widely used traditional positioning and tracking systems. Meanwhile, the tracking system leads to 12.6 percent reduction in the mean position error compared to the CS-based stationary positioning system when three APs are used. A navigation module that is integrated with the tracking system provides users with instructions to guide them to predefined destinations. Thirty visually impaired subjects from the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) were invited to further evaluate the performance of the navigation system. Testing results suggest that the proposed system can be used to guide visually impaired subjects to their desired destinations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Tracking and Navigation Using Received Signal Strength and Compressive Sensing on a Mobile Device","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.175","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6583168/06261513.pdf","startPage":"2050","endPage":"2062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583168","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261513/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Tracking and Navigation Using Received Signal Strength and Compressive Sensing on a Mobile Device","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6261513/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13707256","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Tracking and Navigation Using Received Signal Strength and Compressive Sensing on a Mobile Device","sourcePdf":"ttm2013102050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193252S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6583168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"6583168","articleId":"6261513","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6261526,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Weng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Thomas Weng is a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego.

However, for mainstream stack DRAM, MBIR application is hard to implement due to underlayer metal reflection noise. Furthermore, the production control of the stack DRAM storage capacitor is always the major concern of yield loss and reliability problems. Traditionally, the production monitoring of the storage capacitor has been performed by an x-sectional scanning electron microscope in a PFA laboratory or electron beam inspection (EBI). Unfortunately, it is quite time consuming and has a high cost. In this paper, we report a successful MBIR measurement at scribing line scatter spot with void fraction analysis methodology on 50-nm stack DRAM. We demonstrate excellent correlation of the electrical storage capacitance with a special donut shape, the EBI of underetched storage contact, and the neighboring storage capacitor shortage. The repeatability of the MBIR test is good with average sigma values of 0.56% for the top void fraction and 1.73% for the bottom void fraction, which indicate that MBIR can become a powerful metrological tool for improving product yield and reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355894","htmlLink":"/document/6261532/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"In-Line Supermapping of Storage Capacitor for Advanced Stack DRAM Reliability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Line Supermapping of Storage Capacitor for Advanced Stack DRAM Reliability","sourcePdf":"tdmr-lee-2211875-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063207S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"6472755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","xplore-issue":"6472755","articleId":"6261532","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6261536,"authors":[{"name":"Rakhi Narang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6305505/6261536/6261536-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rakhi Narang (S'10) is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electronic Science, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India."]},"firstName":"Rakhi","lastName":"Narang","id":"38074886500"},{"name":"K.

The algorithm corrects time-varying antenna array phase errors that defocus digital beamforming remote sensing radar imagery. Amplitude errors are treated by equalizing the received powers in all elements. As such, the algorithm does not produce an absolute (or radiometric) calibration vector for the array. The performance of the algorithm is studied using a combination of simulated and real radar data under various conditions and is compared with a clutter-based calibration algorithm. An analytical proof showing that maximizing the expected value of the 4-norm metric is equivalent to phase-calibrating the image, except for a linear phase offset, is provided. We find that the clutter calibration algorithm performs best for statistically homogeneous scenes but that the contrast-calibration algorithms perform better with scenes with larger contrast ratios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2205695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469260","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1754","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6469260/06261544.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contrast-Based Phase Calibration for Remote Sensing Systems With Digital Beamforming Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6261544/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Contrast-Based Phase Calibration for Remote Sensing Systems With Digital Beamforming Antennas","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13343310","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"51","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contrast-Based Phase Calibration for Remote Sensing Systems With Digital Beamforming Antennas","sourcePdf":"tgrs-farquharson-2205695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111737S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6469260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6469260","articleId":"6261544","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6261546,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Montzka","affiliation":["Institute of Bio-and Geosciences: Agrosphere (IBG 3), Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, Julich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6469260/6261546/6261546-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carsten Montzka received the Ph.D. degree in geography from the University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany, in 2007, for the integration of multispectral remote sensing data into nitrogen modeling.","In 2004, he joined the Institute of Bio- and Geosciences: Agrosphere (IBG 3) of the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, J\u00fclich, Germany.

In 2010, several airborne campaigns were conducted to validate the SMOS products with microwave emission radiometers at L-band (1.4 GHz). In this paper, we present results from measurements performed in the Rur and Erft catchments in May and June 2010. The measurement sites were situated in the very west of Germany close to the borders to Belgium and The Netherlands. We developed an approach to validate spatial and temporal SMOS brightness temperature products. An area-wide brightness temperature reference was generated by using an area-wide modeling of top soil moisture and soil temperature with the WaSiM-ETH model and radiative transfer calculation based on the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere model. Measurements of the airborne L-band sensors EMIRAD and HUT-2D on-board a Skyvan aircraft as well as ground-based mobile measurements performed with the truck mounted J\u00dcLBARA L-band radiometer were analyzed for calibration of the simulated brightness temperature reference. Radiative transfer parameters were estimated by a data assimilation approach. By this versatile reference data set, it is possible to validate the spaceborne brightness temperature and soil moisture data obtained from SMOS. However, comparisons with SMOS observations for the campaign period indicate severe differences between simulated and observed SMOS data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Soil moisture","Brightness temperature","Radiometers","Soil measurements","L-band"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric radiation","radiative transfer","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brightness temperature product","soil moisture validation","SMOS validation campaign","Rur catchment","Erft catchment","Germany","European Space Agency","ocean salinity","SMOS satellite","AD 2009 11","soil moisture product","terrestrial areas","AD 2010 05","airborne campaigns","SMOS products","microwave emission radiometers","L-band","AD 2010 06","brightness temperature reference","top soil moisture","soil temperature","WaSiM-ETH model","radiative transfer calculation","biosphere model","L-band Microwave Emission","Skyvan aircraft","ground-based mobile measurements","JULBARA L-band radiometer","radiative transfer parameters","data assimilation approach","spaceborne brightness temperature","soil moisture data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brightness temperature","L-band radiometry","Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) validation","soil moisture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2206031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6469260/06261546.pdf","startPage":"1728","endPage":"1743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2206031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brightness Temperature and Soil Moisture Validation at Different Scales During the SMOS Validation Campaign in the Rur and Erft Catchments, Germany","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Brightness Temperature and Soil Moisture Validation at Different Scales During the SMOS Validation Campaign in the Rur and Erft Catchments, Germany","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261546/","volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261546/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13343312","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brightness Temperature and Soil Moisture Validation at Different Scales During the SMOS Validation Campaign in the Rur and Erft Catchments, Germany","sourcePdf":"tgrs-montzka-2206031-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192399S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6469260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6469260","articleId":"6261546","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6261547,"authors":[{"name":"Dina Goldin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Dina Goldin received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering in 2010 and 2011, respectively, from Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.

Results that were previously derived for binary LDPC codes are extended to the nonbinary case. Both simple and generalized nonbinary LDPC codes are considered. It is shown how the algorithm can be implemented efficiently using a finite-field fast Fourier transform. Then, the convergence rate of the algorithm is analyzed. The complexity of the algorithm scales linearly in the block length, and it can approximate, up to an arbitrarily small relative error, the objective function of the exact LP solution. When applied to a typical code from an appropriate nonbinary LDPC code ensemble, the algorithm can correct a constant fraction of errors in linear (in the block length) computational complexity. Computer experiments with the new iterative LP decoding algorithm show that, in the error floor region, it can have better performance compared to belief propagation decoding, with similar computational requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261547/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","volume":"59","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13187804","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6261547/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Linear Programming Decoding of Nonbinary LDPC Codes With Linear Complexity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Linear Programming Decoding of Nonbinary LDPC Codes With Linear Complexity","sourcePdf":"tit-burshtein-2211859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155494S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6387658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6387658","articleId":"6261547","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6261550,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangxiang Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/6365355/6261550/6261550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangxiang Zeng received the B.S. degree in automation from Hunan University, China, in 2005 and the Ph.

Controllers and adaptive updating laws injected in each vertex of networks depend on the state information of its neighborhood. Three sets of Bernoulli stochastic variables are introduced to describe the occurrence probabilities of distributed adaptive controllers, updating laws and nonlinearities, respectively. By the Lyapunov functions method, we show that the distributed synchronization of networks composed of agent systems with multiple randomly occurring nonlinearities, multiple randomly occurring controllers, and multiple randomly occurring updating laws can be achieved in mean square under certain criteria. The conditions derived in this paper can be solved by semi-definite programming. Moreover, by mathematical analysis, we find that the coupling strength, the probabilities of the Bernoulli stochastic variables, and the form of nonlinearities have great impacts on the convergence speed and the terminal control strength. The synchronization criteria and the observed phenomena are demonstrated by several numerical simulation examples. In addition, the advantage of distributed adaptive controllers over conventional adaptive controllers is illustrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","volume":"43","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13256798","pubMedId":"22893438","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6261564/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Synchronization in Networks of Agent Systems With Nonlinearities and Random Switchings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Synchronization in Networks of Agent Systems With Nonlinearities and Random Switchings","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-tang-2207718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228741S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6340245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"6340245","articleId":"6261564","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6261566,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chun Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Chun","lastName":"Shen","id":"37629832300"},{"name":"Hong-Yeh Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hong-Yeh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280775200"},{"name":"Yu-Chi Wang","affiliation":["WIN Semiconductor Corporation, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37337380200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6261566","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1148},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","HEMTs","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Bandwidth","Gallium arsenide","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","heterojunction bipolar transistors","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","microwave bipolar transistors","microwave field effect transistors","microwave power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monolithic HBT-HEMT-common-emitter stacked power amplifier","common-gate stacked power amplifier","common-emitter configuration","CE configuration","CG configuration","common-source amplifier","stacked PA","high output stacking impedance","power added efficiency","frequency 3.5 GHz to 6.5 GHz","size 2 mum","size 0.5 mum","efficiency 38 percent","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GaAs","HBT","HEMT","microwave","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261566","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2012.2210034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2012.2210034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6291805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/6291805/06261566.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Monolithic 3.5-to-6.5 GHz GaAs HBT-HEMT/Common-Emitter and Common-Gate Stacked Power Amplifier","abstract":"This letter describes a monolithic 3.5-to-6.5 GHz stacked power amplifier (PA) in 2 \u03bcm /0.5 \u03bcm GaAs HBT-HEMT process.

It is fabricated in an SiGe: C BiCMOS technology with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f T</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n of 300 and 500 GHz, respectively. Its measured single-ended gain is 21 dB at 243 GHz with a tuning range of 12 GHz, and a noise figure of 33 dB. The input 1-dB compression point is -37 dBm . The receiver dissipates at 358 mW.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2209447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6384895/06261568.pdf","startPage":"3823","endPage":"3833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2209447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"245-GHz LNA, Mixer, and Subharmonic Receiver in SiGe Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"245-GHz LNA, Mixer, and Subharmonic Receiver in SiGe Technology","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6261568/","accessionNumber":"13187865","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"245-GHz LNA, Mixer, and Subharmonic Receiver in SiGe Technology","sourcePdf":"tmtt-mao-2209447-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101639S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6384895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6384895","articleId":"6261568","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6261586,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Tan","affiliation":["SNC Lavalin, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Tan","id":"38489733400"},{"name":"Xuegui Song","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Xuegui","lastName":"Song","id":"37308677000"},{"name":"Cyril Leung","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Leung","id":"37279072600"},{"name":"Julian Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277386100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6261586","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Approximation methods","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio system","Laplacian noise","receiver operating characteristic curve","characteristic function","cumulative distribution function","energy detector","user ON/OFF hypothesis","closed form expression","probability density function","Pearson approximation","Gaussian noise","data fusion rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","Pearson approximation"]}],"abstract":"The receiver operating characteristic curve is evaluated for a cognitive radio system with Laplacian noise.

Instead of constructing a separate feedback path at each PA, we propose a PD technique based on a combined feedback, which adds all the PAs' outputs to form a single feedback. We develop an algorithm for finding the multiple PA characteristics jointly from the combined feedback. The PD parameters are calculated from the identified PA characteristics. Although the proposed method requires more computations for PA identification than the conventional method, its hardware implementation is much simpler and can overcome the crosstalk problem of a radio frequency (RF) selector, which is necessary for multiple feedback selection. The simulation results show that, despite its simple structure, the linearization performance of the proposed method is almost the same as the separate multiple feedback method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2012.080312.120224","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2012.080312.120224","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6331035/06261591.pdf","startPage":"1572","endPage":"1575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Predistortion Based on Combined Feedback in MIMO Transmitters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Digital Predistortion Based on Combined Feedback in MIMO Transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13057017","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6261591/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Predistortion Based on Combined Feedback in MIMO Transmitters","sourcePdf":"1572-cl1210-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068592S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6331035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6331035","articleId":"6261591","onlineDate":"06 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6261613,"authors":[{"name":"Dietmar Kasper","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Group Research and Advanced Engineering, B\u00f6blingen"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5117645/6261595/6261613/6261613-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dietmar Kasper received his diploma degree in technical computer sciences from the University of Applied Sciences in Esslingen in 2006.

The approach exploits the advantages of an introduced lane-related coordinate system together with individual occupancy schedule grids for all modeled vehicles. This combination allows an efficient classification of the existing vehicle-lane and vehicle- vehicle relations in traffic scenes and thus substantially improves the understanding of complex traffic scenes. Probabilities and variances within the network are propagated systematically which results in probabilistic sets of the modeled driving maneuvers. Using this generic approach, the network is able to classify a total of 27 driving maneuvers including merging and object following.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fall  2012","publicationDate":"Fall 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261613/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2012","volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Object-Oriented Bayesian Networks for Detection of Lane Change Maneuvers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object-Oriented Bayesian Networks for Detection of Lane Change Maneuvers","sourcePdf":"04mits03-kasper-2203229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065084S","chronDate":"Fall  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5117645","isNumber":"6261595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5117645","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6261595","articleId":"6261613","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6261651,"authors":[{"name":"Su-il Choi","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Su-il Choi","id":"37405758000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1378-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1377-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1376-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"CD","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-8528"}],"articleNumber":"6261651","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":634},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261651","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Lighting","Signal to noise ratio","High speed optical techniques","Wireless communication","Power cables","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","light emitting diodes","light sources","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLC channel","white-light led lighting shape","visible light communication","solid-state LED","information broadcasting","optical wireless communication","optical source"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical wireless","visible light communication","whitelight LED"]}],"abstract":"Visible light communications (VLC) uses modern solid-state LEDs to broadcast information.

In this paper, we focus on the resource management for the group handover in mobile femtocellular network deployment. We discuss a number of group handover scenarios. We propose a resource management scheme that contains bandwidth adaptation policy and dynamic bandwidth reservation policy. The simulation results show that the proposed bandwidth management scheme significantly reduces the handover call dropping probability without reducing the bandwidth utilization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6252853/6261644/06261685.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group handover management in mobile femtocellular network deployment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile computing","Bandwidth","Macrocell networks","Quality of service","Ultrafast electronics","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","femtocellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group handover management","mobile femtocellular network deployment","group handover scenarios","resource management scheme","bandwidth adaptation policy","dynamic bandwidth reservation policy","bandwidth management scheme","handover call dropping probability","bandwidth utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile femtocell","handover","group handover","call dropping probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Group handover management in mobile femtocellular network deployment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261685/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12932906","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group handover management in mobile femtocellular network deployment","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06155S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6252853","isNumber":"6261644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6252853","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6261644","articleId":"6261685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6261686,"authors":[{"name":"Kiyohide Nakauchi","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyohide","lastName":"Nakauchi","id":"37427967600"},{"name":"Yozo Shoji","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yozo","lastName":"Shoji","id":"37269001300"},{"name":"Nozomu Nishinaga","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nozomu","lastName":"Nishinaga","id":"37282103700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1378-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1377-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1376-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"CD","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-8528"}],"articleNumber":"6261686","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":572},"abstract":"Wireless network virtualization is needed to build a virtual network over wireless and wired networks, which enables a rapid deployment of novel mobile services or novel mobile network architectures on a shared infrastructure. This paper proposes an airtime-based resource control technique for wireless network virtualization, in which wireless network resources are allocated among competing virtual networks while keeping their programmability. A WLAN system adopting the proposed technique is developed by enhancing an IEEE 802.11e EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) MAC (Media Access Control) mechanism. The operation of the resource control technique is demonstrated by a simulation and the performance of airtime usage and throughput are investigated. It is shown that technique can successfully control the wireless network resource allocations with a target ratio even under conditions when the WLAN system suffers interferences.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6252853/6261644/06261686.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"169","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Airtime-based resource control in wireless LANs for wireless network virtualization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Wireless networks","Wireless LAN","Resource management","Indexes","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","channel allocation","interference suppression","mobile radio","quality of service","resource allocation","virtual private networks","virtualisation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airtime-based resource control","wireless LAN","wireless network virtualization","virtual network","wired network","mobile service deployment","mobile network architecture","shared infrastructure","WLAN","IEEE 802.11e","EDCA","enhanced distributed channel access","MAC","media access control","airtime usage","throughput","resource allocation","interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Virtualization","Wireless Virtualization","Resource Control","Wireless LAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Airtime-based resource control in wireless LANs for wireless network virtualization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261686/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12932907","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Airtime-based resource control in wireless LANs for wireless network virtualization","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048725S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6252853","isNumber":"6261644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6252853","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6261644","articleId":"6261686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6261688,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a macro user moves closer to femtocell, macro user generates greater interference to femto user. If macro user is closer than a critical distance from femto BS, we show that it is better for femto BS to allow access to macro user. By allowing access to macro user, the reduction in available bandwidth for femto user can be compensated by the elimination of interference generated by macro user. We also define an operating region where both the macro user and femto BS has motivation to operate in open access mode. Finally we discuss two policies for open access mode that share the benefits of open access mode differently among the femto user and macro user.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6252853/6261644/06261688.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair admission control policies for femtocell operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Interference","Throughput","Bandwidth","Base stations","Downlink","Admission control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","femtocellular radio","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["admission control policies","femtocell operation","femto BS","bandwidth reduction","femto user","interference elimination","open access mode","base stations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["femtocell","open access","closed access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fair admission control policies for femtocell operation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261688/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12932909","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair admission control policies for femtocell operation","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"2B6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079141S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6252853","isNumber":"6261644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6252853","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6261644","articleId":"6261688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6261700,"authors":[{"name":"Juhyeon Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronics & Communication, Korea University of Technology and Education, Cheonan, Korea"],"lastName":"Juhyeon Lee","id":"37086630015"},{"name":"Hyung-Kun Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronics & Communication, Korea University of Technology and Education, Cheonan, Korea"],"lastName":"Hyung-Kun Park","id":"37402926700"},{"name":"Nam Ho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics, and Control Engineering, Hankyong National University, Anseong, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"lastName":"Nam Ho Kim","id":"37655564600"},{"name":"Yun Seop Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics, and Control Engineering, Hankyong National University, Anseong, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"lastName":"Yun Seop Yu","id":"37086748511"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1378-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1377-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1376-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"CD","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-8528"}],"articleNumber":"6261700","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Sensors","Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Interference","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","channel selection","channel characteristics","throughput","proportional fairness scheduling","primary user behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Channel schedulin","Proportional Fair","Primary user"]}],"abstract":"Channel selection is one of important issues in Cognitive Radio (CR) networks and it is closely related to the channel characteristics and primary user's behavior.

In single-rate technique, most widely used schemes are to skew the multicast group rates to suit the user with least channel gain (LCG) or transmit based on the group average throughput (AVG). However, LCG and AVG cannot provide satisfactory level of fairness and spectral efficiency. In this paper, we show a heuristic algorithm which evidently confirms that we should neither perform single-rate transmissions based on LCG scheme, nor with AVG scheme, but rather we should distribute the high-rate multimedia information over the lower rates using a scalable amortize factor (SAF). Simulation results show that SAF-based single-rate MDRA algorithm is flexible, extensible, offers higher capacity than LCG scheme, and potentially provides rate fairness comparable to AVG scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261706","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6252853/6261644/06261706.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261644","startPage":"255","endPage":"260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation in multicast OFDMA transmissions using scalable amortize factor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation in multicast OFDMA transmissions using scalable amortize factor","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261706/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12932927","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6261706/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource allocation in multicast OFDMA transmissions using scalable amortize factor","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048711S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6252853","isNumber":"6261644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6252853","xplore-issue":"6261644","articleId":"6261706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6261707,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Sani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Sani","id":"38468044500"},{"name":"Aliazam Abbasfar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Aliazam","lastName":"Abbasfar","id":"37276622400"},{"name":"Milad Fozooni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Milad","lastName":"Fozooni","id":"38468211200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1378-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1377-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1376-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"CD","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-8528"}],"articleNumber":"6261707","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Quality of service","Complexity theory","Optimization","OFDM","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","communication complexity","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDMA","QOS","performance optimization","communication networks","quality of service","complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource allocation","OFDMA","Weighted sum rate optimization","Power allocation","QOS"]}],"abstract":"Performance optimization of communication networks with quality of services (QOS) considerations for all active users is highly desirable.

MC-MU-MIMO relay system sets a multi-antenna relay station (RS) at the cell boundary and the RS is shared with adjacent cells. The proposed relay system can improve the throughput of cell boundary due to increasing signal to noise ratio and reducing adjacent cell interference. Since MC-MU-MIMO relay system transmits the data simultaneously toward multiple users located in adjacent cells, a user pairing control for simultaneous data transmission is important to improve the efficiency of channel. This paper proposes a user pairing control method with distributed ordering users for communication by considering the effectiveness of the relay. From computer simulations, we can confirm that the proposed method can improve the throughput performance without increasing the number of RSs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6252853/6261644/06261729.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"368","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-cell shared multi-user MIMO relay with user pairing control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","MIMO","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","interference suppression","MIMO communication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell shared multiuser MIMO relay","user pairing control method","MC-MU-MIMO relay system","cellular networks","multi-antenna relay station","RS","cell boundary","signal to noise ratio","adjacent cell interference reduction","multiple users","data transmission","computer simulations","throughput performance improvement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multi-cell shared multi-user MIMO relay with user pairing control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261729/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12932949","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-cell shared multi-user MIMO relay with user pairing control","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"4B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048595S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6252853","isNumber":"6261644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6252853","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6261644","articleId":"6261729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6261731,"authors":[{"name":"Eiji Okamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37074851100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1378-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1377-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1376-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"CD","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-8528"}],"articleNumber":"6261731","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Chaos","MIMO","Security","Encoding","Vectors","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","chaotic communication","cooperative communication","cryptographic protocols","decoding","diversity reception","MIMO communication","modulation coding","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure cooperative relay transmission","chaos MIMO scheme","cooperative diversity schemes","SNR","multihop transmission","relay terminal","forwarding information decoding","wireless communication systems","upper layer protocol","secure protocol","physical layer security","encrypted relaying","chaos multiple-input multiple-output scheme","C-MIMO scheme","chaos-based encrypted coded-modulation","transmit antenna","dual-hop amplify and forward relaying","AF relaying","coding gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chaos modulation","chaos MIMO","cooperative diversity","amplify-and-forward relay"]}],"abstract":"In wireless communications, cooperative diversity schemes has attracted much attention as an SNR improving technique in multi-hop transmission recently. However, in the multi-hop transmission, usually a relay terminal can decode the forwarding information, which can be a problem in terms of security. In current wireless communication systems, the security is ensured at upper layer protocols. These secure protocols are never exclusive and multiple uses of them are rather desirable as a firmer security is provided. Hence, a physical layer security in conjunction with upper layer security is also important. If the physical layer security is provided, an encrypted relaying can be composed, but there are few studies in conventional works. Therefore in this paper, we propose a secure cooperative relay transmission scheme using chaos multiple-input multiple-output (C-MIMO) scheme in which the relay terminal cannot decode the forwarding information but a cooperative diversity effect and a chaos coding gain are obtained at the destination terminal. C-MIMO is a chaos-based encrypted coded-modulation applied to each transmit antenna of MIMO. By utilizing it into a dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying, the physical layer security, coding gain, and cooperative diversity are obtained. We show the performances of the proposed scheme by computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261731","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6252853/6261644/06261731.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A secure cooperative relay transmission using chaos MIMO scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261731/","displayDocTitle":"A secure cooperative relay transmission using chaos MIMO scheme","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12932951","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261731/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A secure cooperative relay transmission using chaos MIMO scheme","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"4B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061897S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6252853","isNumber":"6261644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6252853","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6261644","articleId":"6261731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6261732,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Tao Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Tao Chiang","id":"37403444300"},{"name":"Kuei-Ping Shih","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuei-Ping Shih","id":"37267411600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1378-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1377-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1376-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"CD","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-8528"}],"articleNumber":"6261732","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"Burst is an atomic bandwidth allocation unit in IEEE 802.16 OFDMA systems.

The BOSS is to alleviate the number of over allocated OFDMA slots caused by the allocation constraint of downlink bandwidth by means of allowing two neighboring bursts to share these over allocated slots.

We propose a novel spatial codebook design with low complexity, and perform dynamic quantization via bit allocations to adapt to the asymmetry of the interference topology.

The availability of good smart phones and better data connectivity are encouraging mobile users to use video services. This huge increase in usage will pose a lot of challenges to the wireless networks. The existing wireless networks lack content awareness within an application. In this paper, we present an approach to content awareness at the Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) level of Long Term Evolution (LTE) system by changing the retransmission count based on the importance of packet being scheduled. This scheme improves the received video quality by up to 8% for users under poor channel conditions with negligible increase in packet delay and Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) utilization factor. The main benefits of this scheme are its simplicity and ease of implementation without compromising on performance of the network elements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAAHR: Content aware adaptive HARQ retransmission scheme for 4G/LTE network","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261749","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6252853/6261644/06261749.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"CAAHR: Content aware adaptive HARQ retransmission scheme for 4G/LTE network","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261749/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12932969","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAAHR: Content aware adaptive HARQ retransmission scheme for 4G/LTE network","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"5A5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060877S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6252853","isNumber":"6261644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6252853","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6261644","articleId":"6261749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6261886,"authors":[{"name":"Dajin Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dajin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37963665500"},{"name":"Liangyan Gui","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liangyan","lastName":"Gui","id":"37969111100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1892-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1890-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1891-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-9660"}],"articleNumber":"6261886","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261886","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Network coding","Noise measurement","Channel coding","Decoding","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","multicast communication","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy network coding scheme","causal channel state information","CSI","discrete memoryless multicast network","DM-MN","relay node","source node","precod- ing","Shannon strategy","message information"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a noisy network coding scheme for relay noisy networks with causal channel state information (CSI). We mainly focus on two models: discrete memoryless multicast network (DM-MN) and discrete memoryless network (DMN). Two different situations are investigated: 1) causal CSI only at the relay nodes, 2) causal CSI at all the nodes. The second situation is easily specialized to other cases: causal CSI at both the source and relay nodes; causal CSI at both the destination and relay nodes. Typically, causal CSI at the transmitter is only used for precoding, known as Shannon strategy. However, in our scheme causal CSI is compressed and transmitted with message information. Wyner-Ziv binning is used for compression and Shannon strategy is exploited to transmit both the message and CSI. It is a channel coding problem with respect to the message. On the other hand, it is a distributed source coding problem for sharing the CSI. We are the first to characterize noisy network coding inner bound with causal CSI. We also recover the result for relay channel (RC) as special case of DM-MN. And we indicate that our bound contains others in previous work. We also discuss some cases in which our scheme is strictly better.","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Network Coding (NetCod)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Network Coding (NetCod)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253017/6261874/06261886.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2012.6261886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2012.6261886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noisy network coding with causal channel state information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Noisy network coding with causal channel state information","htmlLink":"/document/6261886/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12933116","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-30 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noisy network coding with causal channel state information","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07256S","chronDate":"29-30 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253017","isNumber":"6261874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253017","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6261874","articleId":"6261886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6261896,"authors":[{"name":"Kaveh Mahdaviani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Kaveh","lastName":"Mahdaviani","id":"37680572600"},{"name":"Masoud Ardakani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Ardakani","id":"37272335000"},{"name":"Hossein Bagheri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Bagheri","id":"37317319000"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1892-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1890-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1891-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-9660"}],"articleNumber":"6261896","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Network coding","Equations","Encoding","Parity check codes","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","linear codes","network coding","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gamma codes","low-overhead linear-complexity network coding solution","sparse random linear network codes","outer-code","gamma function","decoding complexity","encoding complexity","block length"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a family of sparse random linear network codes with outer-code.

To precisely detect network anomalies (with a few false alarms), an intrusion detection system requires reliable methods. A potential solution in predicting network bandwidth usage is using a time-series model with a threshold. This paper proposes a network anomaly detection technique based on SARIMA, a time-series model, to capture seasonal behavior of bandwidth usage of most networks. Our proposed SARIMA based anomaly detection is capable of detecting network bandwidth anomalies effectively when a threshold equals to 8.5 percents of maximum bandwidth in a day. Our result yields 3.57 percents of false alarms. We concluded that SARIMA is a better instrumental tool for intrusion detection comparing to ARIMA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Ninth International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6250574/6261804/06261934.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"2012 Ninth International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)","doi":"10.1109/JCSSE.2012.6261934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCSSE.2012.6261934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SARIMA based network bandwidth anomaly detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Predictive models","Mathematical model","Intrusion detection","Equations","Computers","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","computer network security","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SARIMA based network bandwidth anomaly detection","intrusion detection system","time-series model","seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forecasting","Intrusion detection","SARIMA","Security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2012-June 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"SARIMA based network bandwidth anomaly detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261934/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12932820","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SARIMA based network bandwidth anomaly detection","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"P020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078957S","chronDate":"May 30 2012-June 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6250574","isNumber":"6261804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6250574","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6261804","articleId":"6261934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6261939,"authors":[{"name":"Sorrachai Yingchareonthawornchai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sorrachai","lastName":"Yingchareonthawornchai","id":"38468024800"},{"name":"Chatchawit Aporntewan","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chatchawit","lastName":"Aporntewan","id":"37427404500"},{"name":"Prabhas Chongstitvatana","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Prabhas","lastName":"Chongstitvatana","id":"37299250300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1921-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1920-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1919-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6261939","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":494},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum computing","Genetic algorithms","Computers","Registers","Vectors","Educational institutions","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","genetic algorithms","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact genetic algorithm implementation","quantum computer programming","evolutionary computation","quantum bit","information storage","quantum register representation","qubit manipulation","solution quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Compact Genetic Algorithms","Quantum Computers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261939","abstract":"Programming a quantum computer posts a challenge. It is not straight forward to transfer the current programming skill on a classical computer to a quantum computer. This work presents an example of programming a quantum computer. The compact genetic algorithm is used as a target as it is powerful and popular method in evolutionary computation. A quantum bit (qubit) concept was introduced as a basis for storing information. The representation of quantum register has benefits over classical computing, i.e. the quantum operation allows manipulating qubits in the way that it is impossible in a classical computer.

Unlike conventional PSO, inertia weight component in the proposed technique is calculated separately for each particle and modification is based on the iteration dependent velocity and position components. With this approach better global and local exploration is achieved which resulted in faster convergence to near global optimal solution. Performance of the proposed PSOIIW based approach is compared with some well accepted evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and real coded genetic algorithm (RGA). From the simulation study it is established that the proposed optimization technique PSOIIW outperforms RGA and PSO, not only in the accuracy of the designed filter but also in the convergence speed and solution quality, i.e., the stop band attenuation, transition width, pass band and stop band ripples. Further, the pole zero analysis justifies the stability of the designed optimal IIR filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2012-June 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261942/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12932828","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6261942/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Digital stable IIR low pass filter optimization using particle swarm optimization with improved inertia weight","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital stable IIR low pass filter optimization using particle swarm optimization with improved inertia weight","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"P028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087425S","chronDate":"May 30 2012-June 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6250574","isNumber":"6261804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6250574","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6261804","articleId":"6261942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6261946,"authors":[{"name":"Abhisek Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Abhisek","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"38468190200"},{"name":"Rajib Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Rajib","lastName":"Kar","id":"37411564000"},{"name":"Durbadal Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Durbadal","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37408356700"},{"name":"Sangeeta Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Sangeeta","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37089131011"},{"name":"S.

In this paper a recently proposed multi-objective swarm optimization algorithm called particle swarm optimization with improved inertia weight (PSOIIW) is applied for the design of optimal linear phase digital band stop finite impulse response (FIR) filter. PSOIIW adopts a new definition for the velocity vector and swarm updating and hence the solution quality is improved. The inertia weight has been modified for the PSO to enhance its search capability to obtain the global optimal solution. The key feature of the applied modified inertia weight mechanism is to monitor the weights of particles, which linearly decrease in general applications. In the design process, the filter length, pass band and stop band frequencies, feasible pass band and stop band ripple sizes are specified. The simulation results obtained prove the superiority of the algorithm compared to the other prevailing optimization algorithms like real code genetic algorithm (RGA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE) for the solution of the multimodal, non-differentiable, highly non-linear, and constrained FIR filter design problems.","doi":"10.1109/JCSSE.2012.6261946","pdfPath":"/iel5/6250574/6261804/06261946.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"173","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Ninth International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)","publicationTitle":"2012 Ninth International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCSSE.2012.6261946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6261804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of linear phase FIR band stop filter using particle swarm optimization with improved inertia weight technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6261946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2012-June 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of linear phase FIR band stop filter using particle swarm optimization with improved inertia weight technique","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12932831","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6261946/","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of linear phase FIR band stop filter using particle swarm optimization with improved inertia weight technique","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"P032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065609S","chronDate":"May 30 2012-June 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6250574","isNumber":"6261804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6250574","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6261804","articleId":"6261946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6261979,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It is expected to improve communication capabilities while maintaining low operational cost using a newly proposed antenna system. The system will consist of a large, stationary spherical reflector fed by multiple, steerable feeds. The size of the reflector will improve signal gain and resolvability of individual signals. This paper will use a derivation of far field solutions for spherical shaped current sources. These solutions will be used to look at the interaction between current distributions on the reflector and the resulting EM field distributions. This will allow for estimation of the beam quality of the system as a function of the reflector geometry, and feed illumination. Other methods may be applied as needed to determine the feed systems. This may include ray-tracing code for reflector based systems, and numerical simulations for phased array systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTEM.2012.6262305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6262280","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15 International Symposium on Antenna Technology and Applied Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6248758/6262280/06262305.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spherical antenna design for satellite communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6262305/","displayDocTitle":"Spherical antenna design for satellite communications","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12932680","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical antenna design for satellite communications","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"FPAN036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042211S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6248758","isNumber":"6262280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6248758","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6262280","articleId":"6262305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6262317,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Fuchs","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electro magnetics and Acoustics, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Fuchs","id":"37319851800"},{"name":"Anja Skrivevik","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electro magnetics and Acoustics, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Anja","lastName":"Skrivevik","id":"38017204300"},{"name":"Juan R.

The geometry of this antenna is designed as a hexagonal cylinder and composed of two major parts. One is the dipole antenna at the center of the structure as an excitation source and the other part is the active selective surfaces (FSS). A bowtie pattern is used as the unit cell of FSS, and its characteristic is carefully optimized. In this study, when the diode is turned on, the FSS becomes transparent, and when the diode is turned off, the FSS is opaque, which is unlike conventional operation. The default operation is to set 3 sidewalls transparent and 3 sidewalls opaque. The opaque sidewalls act as a reflector. The measured results show that radiation pattern can be swept in six steps along the entire azimuth plane with moderate gain of 5dBi and 80\u00b0 beam-width at 2.5GHz. With these features, this simple and low cost beam-switching antenna is suitable for wireless communication system and the application of low power base station system.","doi":"10.1109/ANTEM.2012.6262333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTEM.2012.6262333","publicationTitle":"2012 15 International Symposium on Antenna Technology and Applied Electromagnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15 International Symposium on Antenna Technology and Applied Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6248758/6262280/06262333.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6262280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable beam-switching antenna base on active FSS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable beam-switching antenna base on active FSS","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12932708","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6262333/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable beam-switching antenna base on active FSS","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"FPAN079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039797S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6248758","isNumber":"6262280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6248758","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6262280","articleId":"6262333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6262354,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed I.

The paper covers the transmission systems for SHV program production and satellite broadcasting. For short-haul transmission, an optical digital interface for video equipment was developed. It wavelength-multiplexes eight 10-Gb/s optical signals. It was experimentally confirmed that the transmission distance was at least 2 km, and that a series connection of the interfaces did not severely deteriorate jitter performance. We are also developing a 120-GHz-band wireless contribution short-haul link consisting of three transmitter/receiver pairs. All three pairs transmit and receive a 10.3-Gb/s signal at the same frequency. Experiments showed that transmission with little crosstalk is possible over a distance of 1.25 km when the receiver spacing is 8 m. A long-haul optical contribution link that we developed can transmit a 24-Gb/s SHV signal over a distance of 260 km by using optical amplifiers and no electronic repeaters. An IP network would be a good choice for long-distance links such as an international live contribution link. Several live IP transmissions of compressed video were conducted. Satellite relay transmission and broadcasting technology is also being developed. In particular, we have developed a QPSK/8PSK wide-band modem that uses LDPC and BCH codes. The modem could transmit 251-Mb/s (QPSK) and 677-Mb/s (8PSK) signals and was used in a live SHV satellite-transmission experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6384783/06262441.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2012.2193851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2012.2193851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384783","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6262441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progress of Transmission Technologies for UDTV","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HDTV","Optical amplifiers","Broadcasting","Adaptive optics","Satellite communication","Bit error rate","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","direct broadcasting by satellite","high definition television","IP networks","jitter","modems","parity check codes","quadrature phase shift keying","television receivers","television transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission technologies","research and development","super Hi-Vision","ultrahigh-definition television","UHDTV","SHV program production","satellite broadcasting","short-haul transmission","optical digital interface","video equipment","wavelength-multiplexes","jitter performance","wireless contribution short-haul link","transmitter-receiver pairs","crosstalk","long-haul optical contribution link","optical amplifiers","IP network","IP transmissions","compressed video","satellite relay transmission","broadcasting technology","QPSK-8PSK","wide-band modem","BCH codes","LDPC codes","live SHV satellite-transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital TV","HDTV","satellite broadcasting","video equipment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Progress of Transmission Technologies for UDTV","volume":"101","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6262441/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13187993","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progress of Transmission Technologies for UDTV","sourcePdf":"jproc-oyamada-2193851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078845S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6384783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6384783","articleId":"6262441","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6262444,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Comaschi","affiliation":["Electronic Systems Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Biophysical and Electronic Engineering Department, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6359940/6262444/6262444-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Comaschi was born in Novi Ligure, Italy, on April 23, 1987.

The third-order nonlinearity is suppressed due to the polarization dependent electrooptic coefficients of an X-cut MZM.

In addition, the adjacent channel power ratio and third-order intermodulation distortion to carrier power ratio of an OFDM UWB signal transmitted by an RoF link using mixed polarization sd-xMZM are expressed in closed forms.

In recent years, most multichannel processing for DSL had focused on zero-forcing (ZF) processing that was proven to be near optimal. This near optimality has been observed in numerical evaluations as well as in real life systems. However, this near optimality has only been demonstrated theoretically by relatively loose bounds. In this paper we prove novel bounds on the performance of ZF processing in DSL systems. These bounds are simpler and yet tighter than currently known bounds. These novel bounds support previously published results, and further confirm the near optimality of ZF processing.","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6475983/06262457.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6475983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2212011","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2212011","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6262457","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DSL","Optical network units","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Vectors","Electromagnetic coupling","Interference","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","digital subscriber lines","electromagnetic coupling","interference suppression","numerical analysis","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero forcing DSL systems","multichannel processing","electromagnetic coupling mitigation","wires","multiple users","numerical evaluations","ZF DSL Systems","digital subscriber line systems","zero forcing precoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Performance of Zero Forcing DSL Systems","accessionNumber":"13411110","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6262457/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Performance of Zero Forcing DSL Systems","sourcePdf":"lsp-bergel-2212011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087966S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6475983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6475983","articleId":"6262457","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6262466,"authors":[{"name":"Debasmita Mondal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/6472755/6262466/6262466-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Debasmita Mondal received the B.E. degree from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India in 2009.

In addition, a reduced-order observer is designed to estimate those immeasurable states. Based on the Lyapunov stability method, it is proven that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, and the system outputs track the reference signals to a small neighborhood of the origin by choosing the design parameters appropriately.

Firstly, design and implementation of the low cost dual purpose triangular neural network based device for monitoring the power quality and hence, protecting the grid has been explained and its performance has been presented through numerical investigations. Going a step further, the device has also been experimentally tested using an in-house electric vehicle containing a commercially available battery charger and the measured results are analyzed. Secondly, a high-performance vector-controlled bi-directional off-board level-3 charger for faster and efficient charging has been developed and investigations have been performed on the healthy charger to analyze its performance. The primary aim of developing this charger was to elicit the usage and performance of the previously developed M&P device to protect the grid in case of some typical charger malfunction problem in such a charger, which is not detectable by conventional low cost sensors employed with such chargers. Once the module detects any abnormalities in the charger's operation, information gathered can be used to tune the controller in the charger to obtain a constant improved performance of the charger or the power transfer can be terminated.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2205950","startPage":"1670","endPage":"1678","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6397636/06262471.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2205950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual Purpose Triangular Neural Network Based Module for Monitoring and Protection in Bi-Directional Off-Board Level-3 Charging of EV/PHEV","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Harmonic analysis","Power system harmonics","Performance evaluation","Neural networks","Power quality","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","neural nets","power engineering computing","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual purpose triangular neural network","bi-directional off-board level-3 charging","EV/PHEV","performance charging technology","power quality monitoring","power quality protection","high-performance vector-controlled bi-directional off-board level-3 charger","cost sensors","power transfer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","bi-directional off-board level-3 charger","electric vehicles","monitoring and protection","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","triangular functions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Dual Purpose Triangular Neural Network Based Module for Monitoring and Protection in Bi-Directional Off-Board Level-3 Charging of EV/PHEV","volume":"3","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6262471/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13190960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual Purpose Triangular Neural Network Based Module for Monitoring and Protection in Bi-Directional Off-Board Level-3 Charging of EV/PHEV","sourcePdf":"tsg-iyer-2205950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088994S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6262471","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6262472,"authors":[{"name":"Adamo Ferro","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6469260/6262472/6262472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adamo Ferro received the M.S. degree (summa cum laude) in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In this context, the analysis of the structure of the ice stratigraphy is of primary importance for the study of the past history and for the prediction of the evPolution of icy environments. However, as proven by planetary missions, orbiting radar sounders provide a huge amount of data. Thus, the development of automatic techniques for the analysis of these data is of fundamental importance for proper data exploitation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the automatic detection of subsurface linear features from radar sounder data acquired in icy regions showing extended layering. The proposed method allows the estimation of the position of the linear features with subpixel accuracy. Moreover, each detected linear interface is treated as a single object which is completely described by the position of its points, the estimated local width, and the contrast. This allows the direct measurement of geometrical and radiometric parameters (e.g., slope angle and intensity) without the need of further postprocessing steps. This paper also proposes some measurements for deriving from the output of the proposed technique important variables that can characterize quantitatively the properties of the detected linear features (e.g., mean depth and mean intensity) and their distribution (e.g., number and density of layers). The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the results obtained on several radargrams acquired by the Shallow Radar on the North Pole of Mars.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2206078","startPage":"1622","endPage":"1634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2206078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469260","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6469260/06262472.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Extraction and Analysis of Ice Layering in Radar Sounder Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262472/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Extraction and Analysis of Ice Layering in Radar Sounder Data","volume":"51","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6262472/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13343313","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Extraction and Analysis of Ice Layering in Radar Sounder Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ferro-2206078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.209921S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6469260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6469260","articleId":"6262472","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6262475,"authors":[{"name":"David G.M.

In the first part of this paper, using asymptotic methods to obtain lower bounds on the free distance to constraint length ratio, we show that several ensembles of regular and irregular LDPC convolutional codes derived from protograph-based LDPC block codes have the property that the free distance grows linearly with respect to the constraint length, i.e., the ensembles are asymptotically good. In particular, we show that the free distance to constraint length ratio of the LDPC convolutional code ensembles exceeds the minimum distance to block length ratio of the corresponding LDPC block code ensembles. A large free distance growth rate indicates that codes drawn from the ensemble should perform well at high signal-to-noise ratios under maximum-likelihood decoding. When suboptimal decoding methods are employed, there are many factors that affect the performance of a code. Recently, it has been shown that so-called trapping sets are a significant factor affecting decoding failures of LDPC codes over the additive white Gaussian noise channel with iterative message-passing decoding. In the second part of this paper, we study the trapping sets of the asymptotically good protograph-based LDPC convolutional codes considered earlier. By extending the theory presented in part one and using similar bounding techniques, we show that the size of the smallest non-empty trapping set grows linearly with the constraint length for these ensembles.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2211995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2211995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6387658/06262475.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Distance and Trapping Set Analysis of Protograph-Based LDPC Convolutional Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Distance and Trapping Set Analysis of Protograph-Based LDPC Convolutional Codes","volume":"59","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13187805","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262475/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Distance and Trapping Set Analysis of Protograph-Based LDPC Convolutional Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-mitchell-2211995-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092891S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"6387658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"40","articleId":"6262475","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6262477,"authors":[{"name":"Henrique Oliveira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es-Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisbon, Portugal","Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gest\u00e3o do Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Beja, Beja, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6470717/6262477/6262477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Henrique Oliveira (M'10) received the degree in civil engineering and the M.Sc. degree in geographic information systems in 1995 and 2001, respectively, from the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisbon, Portugal, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Since October 1995, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Engineering Department, Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gest\u00e3o\u2013Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Beja, Beja, Portugal.

The system classifies nonoverlapping image blocks as either containing crack pixels or not. The second task deals with crack type characterization, for which another classification system is constructed, to characterize the detected cracks' connect components. Cracks are labeled according to the types defined in the Portuguese Distress Catalog, with each different crack present in a given image receiving the appropriate label. Moreover, a novel methodology for the assignment of crack severity levels is introduced, computing an estimate for the width of each detected crack. Experimental crack detection and characterization results are presented based on images captured during a visual road pavement surface survey over Portuguese roads, with promising results. This is shown by the quantitative evaluation methodology introduced for the evaluation of this type of system, including a comparison with human experts' manual labeling results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6470717/06262477.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2012.2208630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2012.2208630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6470717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6262477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Road Crack Detection and Characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Surface cracks","Labeling","Training","Feature extraction","Standards","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","road traffic","traffic engineering computing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic road crack detection","automatic road crack characterization","integrated system","road flexible pavement surfaces","visual surveys","image database","unsupervised training","Portuguese distress catalog","image receiving","visual road pavement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","crack characterization","crack severity level","road crack detection","segmentation","unsupervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Road Crack Detection and Characterization","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6262477/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13565841","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Road Crack Detection and Characterization","sourcePdf":"tits-oliveira-2208630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082723S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6470717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"6470717","articleId":"6262477","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6262478,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Gaussens","affiliation":["SATIE, ENS Cachan, CNRS, UniverSud Cachan, Cachan, France"],"bio":{"p":["Benjamin Gaussens was born in Toulouse, France, in 1987.

The analytical method is based on the magnetomotive force (MMF)-permeance theory. The doubly-salient air-gap permeance, developed here, is derived from an exact solution of the slot permeance. Indeed, the relative slot permeance is obtained by solving Maxwell's equations in a subdomain model and applying boundary and continuity conditions. In addition, during a no-load study, we found that, regarding the stator-rotor teeth combination, phase distributions were modified. Hence, in this paper, phase MMF distributions, for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n phases, several stator-rotor combinations and also phase winding distribution (single- or double-layers) are proposed. We compare extensively magnetic field distributions calculated by the analytical model with those obtained from finite-element analyses. Futhermore, the model is used to predict the machine inductances. Once again, FE results validate the analytical prediction, showing that the developed model can be advantageously used as a design tool of FE-FS machine.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2012.2211886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6392328/06262478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2012.2211886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392328","startPage":"628","endPage":"641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Armature Reaction Field Prediction in Field-Excited Flux-Switching Machines Using an Exact Relative Permeance Function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6262478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Armature Reaction Field Prediction in Field-Excited Flux-Switching Machines Using an Exact Relative Permeance Function","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13189918","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6262478/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Armature Reaction Field Prediction in Field-Excited Flux-Switching Machines Using an Exact Relative Permeance Function","sourcePdf":"tmag-gaussens-2211886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140334S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6392328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6392328","articleId":"6262478","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6262485,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph S.

Though heretofore impractical, diode logic allows for the execution of logic circuits that are faster, smaller, and dissipate less power than conventional architectures. In this paper, magnetoresistive semiconductor heterojunctions are used to produce the first complete logic family based solely on diodes. We utilize the diode magnetoresistance states to create a binary logic family based on high and low currents in which a full range of logic functions is executed. The diode is used as a switch by manipulating its magnetoresistance with current-carrying wires that generate magnetic fields. Using this device structure, we present basis logic elements and complex circuits consisting of as few as 10% of the devices required in their conventional CMOS counterparts. This diode logic family is therefore an intriguing potential replacement for CMOS technology as Si scaling reaches its inherent limits.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2012.2211892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6294481/06262485.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2012.2211892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6294481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spin-Diode Logic Family","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6262485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262485/","displayDocTitle":"A Spin-Diode Logic Family","volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12961418","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6262485/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spin-Diode Logic Family","sourcePdf":"tnano-wessels-2211892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06973S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6294481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6294481","articleId":"6262485","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6262487,"authors":[{"name":"Weiyi Feng","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6361328/6262487/6262487-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiyi Feng (S\u201906) was born in China in 1983.

The model is general enough to also include various random wireless channel dynamics such as fading and shadowing arising from multi-path propagation and obstacles existing in the communication environment.

An explicit expression for the scaling coefficient is obtained as a function of fading statistics and the path-loss function.

We develop two iterative methods to solve the highly nonconvex joint source, relay, and receiver optimization problem. In particular, we show that for given source precoding matrices, the optimal relay amplifying matrix diagonalizes the source-relay-destination channel. While for fixed relay matrix and source matrices of all other users, the source matrix of each user has a general beamforming structure.

When the power grid requires frequency regulation service to the aggregator to adjust the grid frequency, the PEVs participating in providing the service can either draw energy (as it is usually done to charge the vehicle) or deliver energy to the grid by means of the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) interface. Under the general framework of optimizing the aggregator profit, different methods, such as state-dependent allocation and the water-filling approach, are proposed to achieve a final state of charge (SOC) of the PEVs that satisfy the desired fairness criteria once the regulation service has been carried out.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6262497/","accessionNumber":"13038916","displayDocTitle":"Fair Design of Plug-in Electric Vehicles Aggregator for V2G Regulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Design of Plug-in Electric Vehicles Aggregator for V2G Regulation","sourcePdf":"tvt-escuderogarzas-2212218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089934S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6330019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6330019","articleId":"6262497","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6262500,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["Wireless and Networking Technologies Laboratory, Information and Communication Technologies Center, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6353156/6262500/6262500-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nan Yang (S'09\u2013M'11) received the B.S. degree in electronics from China Agricultural University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","From 2008 to 2010, he was a Visiting Ph.D. student with the School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.

Based on the asymptotic SSER, we prove that beamforming and antenna selection have the same diversity order. The diversity order is dominated by the weaker source-relay link, which is determined by the product of the number of source antennas and the fading parameter. We proceed to characterize the fundamental difference between the two schemes in terms of their array gains and average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). To obtain further insights, we address the key question of \u201cHow to allocate the total transmit power such that the SSER is minimized?\u201d Our answer is given in the form of new concise expressions for the power-allocation factor that optimally distributes the total transmit power between the sources and the relay. A pivotal conclusion is reached that antenna selection offers the same SSER as beamforming when the source in the weaker link is equipped with a single antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6353156/06262500.pdf","startPage":"3996","endPage":"4008","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2211906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2211906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6262500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Way Relaying With Multi-Antenna Sources: Beamforming and Antenna Selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Relays","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel allocation","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","Nakagami channels","phase shift keying","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiantenna source","beamforming","antenna selection","multiple input multiple output","MIMO two-way relaying scheme","amplify and forward protocol","Nakagami-m fading channel","antenna relay","nonidentical fading parameter","source relay links","sum symbol error rate","M-ary phase shift keying","M-PSK","asymptotic SSER","diversity order","signal-to-noise ratio","power allocation","power distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna selection","beamforming","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relaying","Nakagami- $m$ fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Two-Way Relaying With Multi-Antenna Sources: Beamforming and Antenna Selection","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6262500/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115778","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Way Relaying With Multi-Antenna Sources: Beamforming and Antenna Selection","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2211906-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094317S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6353156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6353156","articleId":"6262500","onlineDate":"07 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6262501,"authors":[{"name":"Yegui Cai","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Yegui","lastName":"Cai","id":"38468455400"},{"name":"F.

To efficiently handle the highly mobile environment of a UAV ad-hoc network, a token-based technique is used to update information in the network as well. The MAC schemes in the presence of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and a discrete stochastic optimization problem, respectively.

The goal is to determine the beamforming matrix so that the signal to noise plus interference ratio at the destination is maximized while respecting power constraints. The considered power constraint here is a total (source and relays) maximum constant power. The key point of this paper is that we propose to use only the second order statistics of channel state information which is a more realistic scenario than the case where instantaneous channel coefficients are assumed to be perfectly known by the relays. We show that, despite some losses compared to the case of zero forcing using perfect channel information, second order statistics based beamforming algorithms are good candidates to reliably support multiple parallel data streams with signal to noise plus interference requirements in multiuser multi-relay systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262575/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12932592","publicationDate":"June 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6262575/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative beamforming for multi-user multi-relay networks based on second-order statistics of channel state information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative beamforming for multi-user multi-relay networks based on second-order statistics of channel state information","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"p37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05753S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255879","isNumber":"6262524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255879","xplore-issue":"6262524","articleId":"6262575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6262588,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Sirbu","affiliation":["Basis of Electronics Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Sirbu","id":"38182105800"},{"name":"Lacrimioara Grama","affiliation":["Basis of Electronics Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Lacrimioara","lastName":"Grama","id":"37872488800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0058-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0057-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0056-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6262588","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Delay","Delay effects","Receivers","Wireless LAN","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network reliability","computer network security","mobile handsets","notebook computers","OFDM modulation","signal processing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WLAN devices location","OFDM signals time synchronization","smart terminals","mobile phones","portable computers","tablets","network security issues","employee security","company security","employee reliability","company reliability","triangulation","advanced signal processsing tehniques","baseband signal","indoor location","acces point","mobile user"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["indoor location","WLAN","time synchronization","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of indoor location for devices that are connected to WLAN.

Accordingly, a number of new terminal and network functionalities are required to solve the technical problems and to provide efficient management of CRNs. The paper advances a new solution for routing in CRNs, providing communication between Secondary Users (SUs) occupying different so-called Spectrum Opportunities (SOPs), i.e., portions of spectrum not occupied by Primary Users (PUs). This entails solving a complex process composed by two fundamental elements. These elements are multi-constraint routing and multi-dimensional adaptation for multiple cognitive radio dimensions like space, frequency, power and time. The goal of the paper is to develop optimization algorithms necessary to provide end-to-end (e2e) routing paths for communication between SUs with associated QoE demands.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262613/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12932630","publicationDate":"June 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6262613/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"p87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049776S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255879","isNumber":"6262524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255879","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6262524","articleId":"6262613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6262619,"authors":[{"name":"Scutariu Adrian-Ionut","affiliation":["University of Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Scutariu","lastName":"Adrian-Ionut","id":"38468124900"},{"name":"Zevedei Dalina","affiliation":["University of Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Zevedei","lastName":"Dalina","id":"38468090000"},{"name":"Mariana Jurian","affiliation":["University of Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Mariana","lastName":"Jurian","id":"37298342100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0058-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0057-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0056-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6262619","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6262619","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Least squares approximation","Antenna radiation patterns","Arrays","Approximation algorithms","Adaptive algorithms","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","convergence of numerical methods","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speed convergence least squares constant modulus algorithm","smart antenna beamforming","least mean squares algorithm","VSSLMS algorithm","variable step size LMS algorithm","constant envelope","hybrid blind equalization algorithm","CMA algorithms","antenna radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart Antenna Systems","Least Mean Squares","Constant Modulus","Speed Convergence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICComm.2012.6262619","publicationTitle":"2012 9th International Conference on Communications (COMM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th International Conference on Communications (COMM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255879/6262524/06262619.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICComm.2012.6262619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6262524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A speed convergence Least Squares Constant Modulus Algorithm for smart antenna beamforming","abstract":"Adaptive algorithms used in smart antenna systems have been thoroughly studied along the years.

Other class of algorithms like the CMA (Constant Modulus Algorithm) does not use a reference signal and has a good performance for signals with a constant envelope.

The insertion loss of two chip stack was evaluated by simulation to realize the signal transmission effects in high speed digital signaling via TSV and micro-joint interconnect. To satisfy the throughput and cost requirement for mass production in future, a wafer-level 3D integration scheme with Cu TSVs based on Cu/Sn micro-bump and BCB adhesive hybrid bonding was demonstrated. Key techniques including TSV fabrication, micro-bumping, hybrid bonding, wafer thinning and backside RDL formation were well developed and integrated to perform the 3D integration scheme.

To realize high-speed image sensor, we have proposed a block-parallel signal processing with 3-D stacked structure. The proposed block-parallel analog signal processing elements contains CMOS image sensor, correlated double sampling (CDS) array, and ADC array. Each circuit layer is vertically stacked and electrically connected by through-Si vias (TSVs), which can improve sensor performance. On the other hand, the block-parallel system requires ADC with extremely low-power and small circuit area. Therefore, the trade-off among area, power dissipation and conversion speed is important factor, and critical challenge. To achieve extremely low circuit area and low power dissipation, ADC designed in the prototype chip for fundamental evaluation employed the time interleaved charge-redistribution successive approximation (SAR) method.

Although process bricks are almost all available now, there are still several challenges to solve before it is introduced in standard flows. One of those which is not commonly addressed is to get final customer's interest by showing him evaluations and results on real industrial applications. Heterogeneous integration and the possibility to partition different functions of a product in separate layers is one of the advantages of 3D integration. In this paper, product partitioning with TSV and 3D integration is demonstrated without inducing any impact on final product functionality and on early package level reliability

Among many issues in 3D IC design and production, testing remains one of the major challenges. This paper introduces a new design-for-test technique called 3D-GESP, an efficient Built-In-Self-Repair (BISR) algorithm to fulfill the test and reliability needs for 3D-stacked memories. Instead of the local testing and redundancy allocation method as most current BISR techniques employed, we introduce a global 3D BISR scheme, which not only enables redundancy sharing, but also parallelizes the BISR procedure among all the stacked layers of a 3D memory. Our simulation results show that our proposed technique will significantly increase the memory repair rate and reduce the test time.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2012.6262967","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC), 2011 IEEE International","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC), 2011 IEEE International","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253019/6262941/06262967.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6262941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2012.6262967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Built-In Self-Repair for 3D memories with redundancy sharing and parallel testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6262967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2012-Feb. 2 2012","displayDocTitle":"Global Built-In Self-Repair for 3D memories with redundancy sharing and parallel testing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6262967/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12936357","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6262967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Jan.-2 Feb. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Built-In Self-Repair for 3D memories with redundancy sharing and parallel testing","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056831S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2012-Feb. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253019","isNumber":"6262941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253019","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6262941","articleId":"6262967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6262979,"authors":[{"name":"John H.

capacitance of through-silicon-vias (TSV) in the silicon interposer as the decoupling capacitor. Because the electrostatic capacity of the TSV acts as a decoupling capacitor, it is enabled to decrease the power distribution network (PDN) impedance. Therefore, the dependency to the PDN impedance in the effect of the layout and the shape of the TSV capacitor was analyzed. By introducing the 3-D electromagnetic field simulator, precise PDN impedance analysis was carried out. As a result, TSV functions enough as a decoupling capacitor. PDN impedance of the silicon inter-poser with TSV-decoupling capacitor decrease compared with that of the silicon interposer without TSV. Especially, PDN impedance of the silicon interposer with 200-micrometer pitch TSVs shows PDN impedance without the resonance peak from the low-frequency region to the high frequency area.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2012.6263017","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC), 2011 IEEE International","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC), 2011 IEEE International","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253019/6262941/06263017.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2012.6263017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6262941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PDN impedance analysis of TSV-decoupling capacitor embedded Silicon interposer for 3D-integrated CMOS image sensor system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2012-Feb. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263017/","displayDocTitle":"PDN impedance analysis of TSV-decoupling capacitor embedded Silicon interposer for 3D-integrated CMOS image sensor system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12943932","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263017/","conferenceDate":"31 Jan.-2 Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PDN impedance analysis of TSV-decoupling capacitor embedded Silicon interposer for 3D-integrated CMOS image sensor system","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"P21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069366S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2012-Feb. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253019","isNumber":"6262941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253019","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6262941","articleId":"6263017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6263018,"authors":[{"name":"Nam Hee Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Nano Bio and Energy Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Nam Hee","lastName":"Kwon","id":"38468984500"},{"name":"S.

An extra interposer layer, however, is introduced for interconnect in a 2.5D design. With 2D, 2.5D, and 3D design options, the fabrication cost is an important metric to decide which technology should be adopted for different designs. In this paper, we present a cost estimation method for 2.5D ICs by extending a 3D floorplanning tool and the 3D cost models. This method can provide an estimated cost comparison among three technologies as a reference of choosing the strategy during the early design stage. We apply our method to several design benchmarks and compare the cost with different design strategies. Moreover, the interconnect delay and temperature results are also provided for comparison.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2012.6263032","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC), 2011 IEEE International","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC), 2011 IEEE International","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253019/6262941/06263032.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2012.6263032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6262941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication cost analysis for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D IC designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Jan.-2 Feb. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2012-Feb. 2 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication cost analysis for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D IC designs","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6263032/","accessionNumber":"12943947","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication cost analysis for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D IC designs","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"P223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048032S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2012-Feb. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253019","isNumber":"6262941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253019","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6262941","articleId":"6263032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6263033,"authors":[{"name":"Seyyed Hasan Moallempour","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and IT, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyyed Hasan","lastName":"Moallempour","id":"38468287800"},{"name":"Seyyed Ahmad Razavi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and IT, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyyed Ahmad","lastName":"Razavi","id":"38181103300"},{"name":"Morteza Saheb Zamani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and IT, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Morteza Saheb","lastName":"Zamani","id":"37408743600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2190-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2189-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2188-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6263033","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TSV reduction in homogeneous 3D FPGAs by logic resource and input pad replication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263033","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Pins","Routing","Delay","Switches","Wires","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated logic circuits","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TSV reduction","3D FPGA","logic resource","input pad replication","three-dimensional integrated circuit fabrication process","through silicon vias manufacturing","MCNC benchmarks","delay","logic blocks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Three dimensional FPGA","Through silicon via","Replication"]}],"abstract":"One of the major challenges in the process of three-dimensional integrated circuit fabrication is the manufacturing of through silicon vias (TSV).

Experiments show that, compared to PCRAM, the proposed CBRAM-crossbar based memory achieves 10x~100x faster accessing time, at least 100x less operation power, and 100x longer endurance.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2012.6263047","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC), 2011 IEEE International","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC), 2011 IEEE International","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253019/6262941/06263047.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2012.6263047","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6262941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design exploration of 3D stacked non-volatile memory by conductive bridge based crossbar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2012-Feb. 2 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design exploration of 3D stacked non-volatile memory by conductive bridge based crossbar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263047/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12943962","conferenceDate":"31 Jan.-2 Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design exploration of 3D stacked non-volatile memory by conductive bridge based crossbar","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"P27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086095S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2012-Feb. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253019","isNumber":"6262941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253019","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6262941","articleId":"6263047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6263197,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These channels show up in certain practical scenarios, such as in the deep-water horizontal transmissions and in the underwater broadcasting networks, and introduce both interblock interference and intercarrier interference (IBI/ICI) in the received signal. For joint IBI and ICI mitigation, we propose a factor-graph-based equalization method, in which estimation of information symbols is performed via messages passing over a well-designed graph. We also present a sparse channel estimator by treating the two clusters of the long channel as two virtual quasi-synchronous channels. Both channel estimation and equalization are integrated into a progressive receiver framework. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the receiver performance in both deep-water horizontal channels and underwater broadcasting networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Factor-Graph-Based Joint IBI/ICI Mitigation for OFDM in Underwater Acoustic Multipath Channels With Long-Separated Clusters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2012.2205639","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/6311303/06263251.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2012.2205639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6311303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Factor-Graph-Based Joint IBI/ICI Mitigation for OFDM in Underwater Acoustic Multipath Channels With Long-Separated Clusters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6263251/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038432","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factor-Graph-Based Joint IBI/ICI Mitigation for OFDM in Underwater Acoustic Multipath Channels With Long-Separated Clusters","sourcePdf":"joe-zhou-2205639-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118832S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6311303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6311303","articleId":"6263251","onlineDate":"08 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6263252,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan A.

Coherent receivers used in these systems measure the amplitude and phase of the optical signals for both orthogonally polarized components carrying information. Knowledge of the amplitude and phase of the optical field, in combination with digital signal processing, gives the receiver an inherent metrology and performance monitoring capability. As the optical signal propagates from the transmitter over optical fiber to the receiver, a signal transformation and degradation is expected. The receiver observes the properties of the transmitted optical signal as degraded by the impairments of the transmission medium. The details of monitoring optical signal parameters and link impairments are the focus of this paper. The optical signal parameters include polarization state and residual carrier phase; optical link impairments include chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion. Two distinct techniques are presented: one based on Stokes space analysis, and the other on Kalman filtering. The Stokes space techniques are modulation-format independent and do not require demodulation. The Kalman filtering provides optimal estimation of the physical quantities that describe the optical signal and the optical medium.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2212234","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6401181/06263258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2212234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6401181","startPage":"648","endPage":"663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Monitoring and Measurement Techniques for Coherent Optical Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Monitoring and Measurement Techniques for Coherent Optical Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13234180","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6263258/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Monitoring and Measurement Techniques for Coherent Optical Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-szafraniec-2212234-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074468S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6401181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6401181","articleId":"6263258","onlineDate":"08 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6263260,"authors":[{"name":"Antoine Descoeudres","affiliation":["Institute of Microengineering (IMT), Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Descoeudres","id":"37595070900"},{"name":"Zachary C.

The new LIVE Mobile Video Quality Assessment (VQA) database consists of 200 distorted videos created from 10 RAW HD reference videos, obtained using a RED ONE digital cinematographic camera. While the LIVE Mobile VQA database includes distortions that have been previously studied such as compression and wireless packet-loss, it also incorporates dynamically varying distortions that change as a function of time, such as frame-freezes and temporally varying compression rates. In this article, we describe the construction of the database and detail the human study that was performed on mobile phones and tablets in order to gauge the human perception of quality on mobile devices. The subjective study portion of the database includes both the differential mean opinion scores (DMOS) computed from the ratings that the subjects provided at the end of each video clip, as well as the continuous temporal scores that the subjects recorded as they viewed the video. The study involved over 50 subjects and resulted in 5,300 summary subjective scores and time-sampled subjective traces of quality. In the behavioral portion of the article we analyze human opinion using statistical techniques, and also study a variety of models of temporal pooling that may reflect strategies that the subjects used to make the final decision on video quality. Further, we compare the quality ratings obtained from the tablet and the mobile phone studies in order to study the impact of these different display modes on quality. We also evaluate several objective image and video quality assessment (IQA/VQA) algorithms with regards to their efficacy in predicting visual quality. A detailed correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing is carried out. Our general conclusion is that existing VQA algorithms are not well-equipped to handle distortions that vary over time. The LIVE Mobile VQA database, along with the subject DMOS and the continuous temporal scores is being made available to researchers in the field of VQA at no cost in order to further research in the area of video quality assessment.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2212417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6301690/06263265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2212417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6301690","startPage":"652","endPage":"671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Quality Assessment on Mobile Devices: Subjective, Behavioral and Objective Studies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Video Quality Assessment on Mobile Devices: Subjective, Behavioral and Objective Studies","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12999315","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6263265/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Quality Assessment on Mobile Devices: Subjective, Behavioral and Objective Studies","sourcePdf":"jstsp-moorthy-2212417-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135196S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6301690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"6301690","articleId":"6263265","onlineDate":"08 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6263266,"authors":[{"name":"Haowen Chen","affiliation":["Research Institute of Space Electronics Information Technology in Electronics Science and Engineering School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Haowen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600761300"},{"name":"Jin Yang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Space Electronics Information Technology in Electronics Science and Engineering School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37676817400"},{"name":"Wei Zhou","affiliation":["Research Institute of Space Electronics Information Technology in Electronics Science and Engineering School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37590580000"},{"name":"Hongqiang Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Space Electronics Information Technology in Electronics Science and Engineering School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hongqiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538484400"},{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["Research Institute of Space Electronics Information Technology in Electronics Science and Engineering School, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37280877200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6263266","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","MIMO radar","Geometry","Reflection coefficient","Radar antennas","Noise level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dimension theory","direction-finding (DF)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) radar","parameter identification capacity (PIC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263266","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2012.2212173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the number of targets that can be uniquely localized by a direction-finding (DF) multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) radar system, often referred to as the parameter identification capacity (PIC), regardless of any certain DF algorithm.

Finally, the PICs of four representative antenna geometries are investigated and compared.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2012.2212173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170612","startPage":"949","endPage":"952","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6170612/06263266.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Unique Localization of Multiple Targets by MIMO Radars","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6263266/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Unique Localization of Multiple Targets by MIMO Radars","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Unique Localization of Multiple Targets by MIMO Radars","sourcePdf":"lawp-chen-2212173-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046418S","chronDate":"2012","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6170612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6170612","articleId":"6263266","onlineDate":"08 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6263267,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 A.

However, if the available data from that scene are insufficient, the fuzzy systems trained will suffer from weak generalization for the modeling task in this scene. In order to overcome this problem, a fuzzy system with knowledge-leverage capability, which is known as a knowledge-leverage-based fuzzy system (KL-FS), is proposed in this paper. The KL-FS not only makes full use of the data from the current scene in the learning procedure but can effectively make leverage on the existing knowledge from the reference scene, e.g., the parameters of a fuzzy system obtained from a reference scene, as well. Specifically, a knowledge-leverage-based Mamdani-Larsen-type fuzzy system (KL-ML-FS) is proposed by using the reduced set density estimation technique integrating with the corresponding knowledge-leverage mechanism. The new fuzzy system modeling technique has been verified by experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, where KL-ML-FS has better performance and adaptability than the traditional fuzzy modeling methods in scenarios with insufficient data.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2212444","startPage":"597","endPage":"609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2212444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6572863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6572863/06263294.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-Leverage-Based Fuzzy System and Its Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263294/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-Leverage-Based Fuzzy System and Its Modeling","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6263294/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13692643","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-Leverage-Based Fuzzy System and Its Modeling","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wang-2212444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151552S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6572863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6572863","articleId":"6263294","onlineDate":"08 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6263296,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Molkaraie","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada","Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Mehdi Molkaraie received his M.Sc. degree from University of Tehran, Iran in 2002, and his Ph.D. from EPF Lausanne, Switzerland in 2007.

The viability of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2212413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2212413","startPage":"495","endPage":"503","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6387658/06263296.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo Algorithms for the Partition Function and Information Rates of Two-Dimensional Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo Algorithms for the Partition Function and Information Rates of Two-Dimensional Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","volume":"59","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263296/","accessionNumber":"13187807","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263296/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo Algorithms for the Partition Function and Information Rates of Two-Dimensional Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-molkaraie-2212413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142622S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6387658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6387658","articleId":"6263296","onlineDate":"08 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6263297,"authors":[{"name":"Rahil Garnavi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, NICTA Victoria Research Laboratory, Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","IBM Research Australia, Carlton, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/6353358/6263297/6263297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rahil Garnavi (M'10) received the Bachelor's degree in software engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, the Master's degree in artificial intelligence from Isfahan University, Isfahan, Iran, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nicta Victoria Research Lab., University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic., Australia, in 2011, developing a computer-aided diagnostic system for melanoma.","In June 2011, she joined IBM Research Australia, where her main research is on healthcare.

The novelty lies in the optimized selection and integration of features derived from textural, border-based, and geometrical properties of the melanoma lesion. The texture features are derived from using wavelet-decomposition, the border features are derived from constructing a boundary-series model of the lesion border and analyzing it in spatial and frequency domains, and the geometry features are derived from shape indexes. The optimized selection of features is achieved by using the gain-ratio method, which is shown to be computationally efficient for melanoma diagnosis application. Classification is done through the use of four classifiers; namely, support vector machine, random forest, logistic model tree, and hidden naive Bayes. The proposed diagnostic system is applied on a set of 289 dermoscopy images (114 malignant, 175 benign) partitioned into train, validation, and test image sets. The system achieves an accuracy of 91.26% and area under curve value of 0.937, when 23 features are used. Other important findings include 1) the clear advantage gained in complementing texture with border and geometry features, compared to using texture information only, and 2) higher contribution of texture features than border-based features in the optimized feature set.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Melanoma Using Border- and Wavelet-Based Texture Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2012.2212282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/6353358/06263297.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2012.2212282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Melanoma Using Border- and Wavelet-Based Texture Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6263297/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13168265","pubMedId":"22893445","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Melanoma Using Border- and Wavelet-Based Texture Analysis","sourcePdf":"titb-garnavi-2212282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161935S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"6353358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"6353358","articleId":"6263297","onlineDate":"08 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6263307,"authors":[{"name":"Zuyuan Yang","affiliation":["Faculty of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6298049/6263307/6263307-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zuyuan Yang received the B.E. degree from the Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2010.","He is a currently a Researcher with the Faculty of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou.

Based on this measure, a new NBSS model is derived, and an iterative sparseness maximization (ISM) approach is proposed to solve this model. In the ISM approach, the NBSS problem can be cast into row-to-row optimizations with respect to the unmixing matrix, and then the quadratic programming (QP) technique is used to optimize each row. Furthermore, we analyze the source identifiability and the computational complexity of the proposed ISM-QP method. The new method requires relatively weak conditions on the sources and the mixing matrix, has high computational efficiency, and is easy to implement.

To reduce the computational complexity of antenna selection (AS), two sequential AS algorithms, joint AS (JAS) and separate AS (SAS), are proposed. JAS jointly selects a pair of receive-transmit antennas at each sequential step. In contrast, SAS separates receive and transmit AS into a two-stage algorithm; the receive antenna set is selected first, followed by selection of the transmit antennas.

practical error control SWA communication system. Herein, as one of the dynamic coding schemes, rate compatible LDPC (RC-LDPC) codes combing OFDM technique are proposed to improve the system reliability for SWA communications. Based on the automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanism, the proposed SWA OFDM system consists of three important preprocessing: channel state information (CSI) estimator, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimator and RC-LDPC pattern. The design of RC-LDPC codes and SWA channel profile are described. A look-up table (LUT) of RC-LDPC performances for ARQ-SWA system is built via statistical simulation test. For the proposed scheme, we define and derive the sensitivity to channel time variations and the effects of different performance target BER threshold, which are further confirmed via numerical results. It is shown that RC-LDPC codes have good performances with wide range of rates in SWA channels.

The hybrid-driven underwater glider is a new breed of underwater platform, which combines the features of a conventional glider and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The neural network controller based on multilayer perceptron has been designed as a predictive control. The design objective is to map the control input as well as achieving the target output. A three-layer network, which has six input nodes (control inputs), six hidden layer nodes, and fourteen output nodes is designed as the forward model architecture. Meanwhile, the inverse model of the network is used for the neural network controller. The simulation demonstrates that the control inputs of the glider motion and the target outputs of the reference model are successfully predicted and achieved. The results show that the glider is stable, and the performance of neural network controller is satisfactory, where the value of accuracy is more than 90%.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263429","pdfPath":"/iel5/6248433/6263358/06263429.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Oceans - Yeosu","publicationTitle":"2012 Oceans - Yeosu","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks control of hybrid-driven underwater glider","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks control of hybrid-driven underwater glider","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12932300","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6263429/","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks control of hybrid-driven underwater glider","confLoc":"Yeosu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"120112046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078782S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6248433","isNumber":"6263358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6248433","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6263358","articleId":"6263429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6263530,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It investigates of the use of Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OOFDM) as a modulation scheme and presents the characteristics of the underwater propagation channel for amplitude modulated optical waves. Although system under investigation utilizes a data rate of 1 Mbpsm, it is evident that higher data rates are possible with minor changes in the optical front-end hardware and the signal processing chain. To evaluate the system performance, tests were conducted in clear water for distances up to three meters and in three simulated scenarios of dirty water (deep, medium and shallow) for a distance of half a meter. All test were performed in a controlled laboratory environment using a water tank. The performance of the system has been evaluated using offline processing of the received OOFDM symbols. The Bit-Error Rate (BER) performance of the system is investigated as function of bandwidth, distance of transmission, and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Additionally, the transfer function of the optical underwater channel characteristics are presented along with measured statistics of delay spread of the channel to show the presence or absence of multi-path effects. It should be noted that the intended application of this system is docking of remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles, where high speed data transfers are essential. Another possible application is data collection from deployed sensors gathering data over a long periods of time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Oceans - Yeosu","pdfPath":"/iel5/6248433/6263358/06263530.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 Oceans - Yeosu","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-range optical OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical signal processing","Optical receivers","Adaptive optics","Optical sensors","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical communication","telecommunication channels","underwater acoustic communication","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-range optical OFDM","OOFDM","short range underwater optical wireless communication system","optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OOFDM symbols","underwater propagation channel","amplitude modulated optical waves","optical front-end hardware","signal processing chain","controlled laboratory environment","bit-error rate","BER performance","signal- to-noise ratio","SNR","optical underwater channel characteristics","delay statistics","multipath effects","autonomous underwater vehicles","remotely operated underwater vehicles","data gathering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Short-range optical OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263530/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12932373","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-range optical OFDM","confLoc":"Yeosu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"120113118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059177S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6248433","isNumber":"6263358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6248433","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6263358","articleId":"6263530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6263539,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang Hwa Lee","affiliation":["Department of the Navy, Panama City Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Kwang Hwa","lastName":"Lee","id":"38468227400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2091-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2089-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2090-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6263539","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Boundary conditions","Equations","Vectors","Mathematical model","Scattering","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic wave scattering","distributed processing","finite element analysis","geophysics computing","Helmholtz equations","oceanographic techniques","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain decomposition method","acoustic-structure finite element model","DDM","nonsymmetric sections","acoustic scattering","underwater target","Helmholtz equation","infinite exterior region truncation","nonreflecting absorbing boundary conditions","radiation boundary conditions","multigrid meshes","mapping function","decoupled sections","equilibrium","memory size","run time reduction","distributed computational system","ASFEM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic-Structure Finite Element Method","Domain Decomposition Method","Distributed System"]}],"abstract":"A new Domain Decomposition Method (DDM) is proposed, which breaks an Acoustic-Structure Finite Element Model (ASFEM) into multiple non-symmetric sections, computes the scattering by each one as an independent system, and combines all the solutions of the individual segments to get the entire scattering solution. In general, the approach to get a finite element solution for acoustic scattering from an underwater target uses the Helmholtz equation as the governing equation and non-reflecting absorbing or radiation boundary conditions to truncate the infinite exterior region. The solution is obtained in the frequency domain and is stationary by nature. Our purpose here is to devise a hybrid, stationary, ASFEM solution using the DDM to enable more efficient use of memory for very complex targets. Taking advantage of the stationary of the solution and using multi-grid meshes with a mapping function to update boundary conditions on the surface of separated sections, the final solution for all the decoupled sections is determined iteratively, taking sufficient steps to reach equilibrium in all sections. The method can make it possible to get a solution for an ASFEM whose geometry is not symmetric in any space direction and requires too many elements to run on a single processor due to the limited memory size. It can also be used to reduce the run time of an ASFEM solution using a distributed computational system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain decomposition method for solution of acoustic-structure finite element method for distributed computation","publicationTitle":"2012 Oceans - Yeosu","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263539","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Oceans - Yeosu","pdfPath":"/iel5/6248433/6263358/06263539.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Domain decomposition method for solution of acoustic-structure finite element method for distributed computation","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263539/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12932382","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain decomposition method for solution of acoustic-structure finite element method for distributed computation","confLoc":"Yeosu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"120113134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05585S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6248433","isNumber":"6263358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6248433","xplore-issue":"6263358","articleId":"6263539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6263548,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Xu","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309524600"},{"name":"Huihong Shi","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huihong","lastName":"Shi","id":"38468091900"},{"name":"Huiquan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huiquan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37067527200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2091-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2089-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2090-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6263548","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Arrays","Gratings","Receivers","Sensors","Equations","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","echo","geophysical signal processing","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse reconstruction based high resolution beamforming","multibeam systems","linear equation","spatial sparsity","echoes","direction of arrival"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse-reconstruction-based high resolution beamforming and its application to multi-beam systems","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263358","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 Oceans - Yeosu","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Oceans - Yeosu","pdfPath":"/iel5/6248433/6263358/06263548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263548","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263548","abstract":"In this paper, we present a high resolution beam-forming (BF) method for multi-beam systems based on sparse reconstruction algorithms.

Distributed beamforming is a cooperative transmission scheme whereby a number of nodes in a wireless network organize themselves into a virtual antenna array and focus their transmission in the direction of the intended receiver, potentially achieving order of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency. The main technical challenge in realizing these gains is in precisely synchronizing the radio frequency signals of the cooperating nodes. This idea has been studied extensively over the past decade, and several techniques and architectures for its practical implementation have been developed. In this work, we demonstrate our recent implementation of distributed beamforming on a standard, open-source, software-defined radio platform, where the low quality oscillators make synchronization particularly challenging. Our demonstration will consist of three cooperating transmitters sending signals that add up constructively at the receiver. Low-rate feedback packets broadcast from the receiver are employed for frequency and phase synchronization at each transmitter in completely distributed fashion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12933032","htmlLink":"/document/6263729/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Demonstrating distributed transmit beamforming with software-defined radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstrating distributed transmit beamforming with software-defined radios","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03DemoDemonstratingdistributedtransmitbeamformingw.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087322S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253016","isNumber":"6263669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253016","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6263669","articleId":"6263729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6263752,"authors":[{"name":"Namrata Bapat","affiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Namrata","lastName":"Bapat","id":"38468057500"},{"name":"Violet R.

In a cognitive radio ad hoc network (CRAHN) setting, such reconfiguration is challenging due to the lack of centralized control and fixed infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the throughput of secondary users (SUs) in a CRAHN by dynamically adapting their sensing and transmission times. First, we conduct a designed experiment on five CR parameters in the ns-2 network simulator with extensions to support CRAHNs. A statistical analysis of the resulting data attributes the contribution of each parameter, and interactions among them, to SU throughput. Based on these results, we propose for each SU to measure its instantaneous throughput and adapt its sensing and transmission times according to the predicted throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that SUs achieve higher throughput by adapting their sensing and transmission times than by using default static values for these parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263752/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12933055","publicationDate":"June 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263752/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adapting sensing and transmission times to improve throughput in cognitive radios ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapting sensing and transmission times to improve throughput in cognitive radios ad hoc networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WSCORALAdaptiveSensingandTransmissiontimestoimprov.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052595S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253016","isNumber":"6263669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253016","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6263669","articleId":"6263752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6263753,"authors":[{"name":"Xiukui Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xiukui","lastName":"Li","id":"37065208900"},{"name":"Seyed A.

The 2-D ST spectrum sensing allows the secondary users to search and detect white spaces along different spatial directions at a given time instance. This 2-D ST interrogation of the radio environment enables efficient sharing of primary frequency bands over multiple spatial directions in different instances of time. The use of frequency agile antennas is highlighted to mitigate interferences at known frequencies. Broadband/intermediate-frequency (IF) and analog/digital realizations of 2-D ST filters are proposed to perform the directional enhancement of signals. A low complexity highly-selective tunable 1-D digital BPF is proposed to be used with energy detection to perform spectral sensing along the required direction in space. The tunable BPF eliminates the need of computationally intensive high resolution FFT for frequency scanning. A prototype FPGA implementation of the BPF operating at 66 MHz is used to study the effect of finite precision arithmetic with a word length of 8 bits.","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263754","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253016/6263669/06263754.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263754","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional spectrum sensing using tunable multi-D space-time discrete filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Directional spectrum sensing using tunable multi-D space-time discrete filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263754/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263754/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12933057","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional spectrum sensing using tunable multi-D space-time discrete filters","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WSCORALDirectionalSpectrumSensingusingTunableMulti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064517S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253016","isNumber":"6263669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253016","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6263669","articleId":"6263754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6263755,"authors":[{"name":"Peyman Setoodeh","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Laboratory, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Setoodeh","id":"37565875600"},{"name":"Simon Haykin","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Laboratory, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Haykin","id":"37285076500"},{"name":"Keyvan Rezaei Moghadam","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Keyvan Rezaei","lastName":"Moghadam","id":"38072963700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1239-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1238-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1237-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6263755","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Hilbert space","Interference","Receivers","Predictive models","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Hilbert spaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-layer dynamics","cognitive radio networks","wireless communications","cognitive wireless world","spectrum holes","master-slave relationship","multiple-time-scale dynamic system","secondary users change","double-layer dynamic systems","time-dependent equilibria","time-dependent behaviour","evolutionary variational inequalities","projected dynamic systems","Hilbert spaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Affine variational inequality (AVI)","cognitive radio","double-layer dynamic systems","evolutionary variational inequalities (EVI)","hybrid dynamic systems","iterative waterfilling algorithm (IWFA)","projected dynamic (PD) systems","variational inequalities (VI)"]}],"abstract":"There are two worlds of wireless communications: the legacy wireless world and the cognitive wireless world. Spectrum holes are the medium through which the two worlds interact. Releasing subbands by primary users allows the cognitive radio users to perform their normal tasks and, therefore, to survive. In other words, the old world affects the new world through appearance and disappearance of the spectrum holes and there is a master-slave relationship between them. Hence, the two worlds of wireless communications are going on side by side. This makes a cognitive radio network a multiple-time-scale dynamic system: a large-scale time in which the activities of primary users change and a small-scale time in which the activities of secondary users change accordingly. Such systems are called double-layer dynamic systems. A model is built that can be used as a testing tool for policy forecast and incorporates time evolution as the life span (control horizon) of a given policy. Two types of time dependency are studied: time-dependent equilibria and time-dependent behaviour away from the predicted curve of equilibria. Theories of evolutionary variational inequalities and projected dynamic systems on Hilbert spaces are used to study these two types of time dependency, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263755","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253016/6263669/06263755.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263755","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double-layer dynamics of cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Double-layer dynamics of cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263755/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263755/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12933058","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-layer dynamics of cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WSCORALDoubleLayerDynamicsofCognitiveRadioNetworks.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057777S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253016","isNumber":"6263669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253016","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6263669","articleId":"6263755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6263756,"authors":[{"name":"Peyman Setoodeh","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Laboratory, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Setoodeh","id":"37565875600"},{"name":"Simon Haykin","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Laboratory, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Haykin","id":"37285076500"},{"name":"Keyvan Rezaei Moghadam","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Keyvan","lastName":"Rezaei Moghadam","id":"38072963700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1239-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1238-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1237-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6263756","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263756","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supply chains","Cognitive radio","TV","Transportation","Vectors","Radio transmitters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","pricing","supply chains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic spectrum supply chain model","cognitive radio networks","supply chain network theory","spectrum market","decision makers","legacy owners","spectrum brokers","secondary users","governing equilibrium conditions","transient behavior","prices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","projected dynamic (PD) systems","supply chain network","variational inequalities (VI)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263756","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253016/6263669/06263756.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum supply chain model for cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Built on the theory of supply chain networks, this paper presents a model for the spectrum market, which includes three different tiers of decision makers; legacy owners, spectrum brokers, and secondary users (cognitive radios).

By employing the proposed algorithms, we can contribute to efficient implementation of spectrum sensing process as well as intelligent coexistence mechanisms in TV white space.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12933061","htmlLink":"/document/6263758/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficient multi-channel signal detection algorithms for cognitive radio systems in TV white space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient multi-channel signal detection algorithms for cognitive radio systems in TV white space","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WSCORALEfficientmultichannelsignaldetectionalgorit.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055957S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253016","isNumber":"6263669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253016","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6263669","articleId":"6263758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6263760,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Robertson","affiliation":["Networks and Communications Systems Branch, Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington DC, DC, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Robertson","id":"38468118300"},{"name":"Lan Tran","affiliation":["Networks and Communications Systems Branch, Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington DC, DC, USA"],"lastName":"Lan Tran","id":"37274772100"},{"name":"Joseph Molnar","affiliation":["Networks and Communications Systems Branch, Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington DC, DC, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Molnar","id":"37289292200"},{"name":"Er-Hsien Frank Fu","affiliation":["KEYW Corporation, Hanover, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Er-Hsien Frank","lastName":"Fu","id":"38468001100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1239-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1238-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1237-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6263760","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Clocks","Face","Cognitive radio","Heuristic algorithms","Indexes","Communication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","military communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind rendezvous algorithms","tactical networks","spectrally agile radios problem","communication channels","GNU radio testbed","modified modular clock","MMC algorithm","random channel access algorithms","channel configurations","accessible channels","control-channel","asynchronization","rendezvous time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind rendezvous","dynamic spectrum access","modular clock algorithm","cognitive radio"]}],"abstract":"We examine the problem of spectrally agile radios executing blind rendezvous over a set of communication channels using a GNU radio testbed. The performances of the Modified Modular Clock (MMC) and random channel access (RA) algorithms are compared across channel configurations that tactical radios will likely face. We assume no pre-coordinated channel indexing, no knowledge of the set or number of other nodes' accessible channels, and no control-channel. We find that the MMC algorithm generally outperforms RA modestly in terms of average rendezvous time and substantially in terms of worst-case rendezvous time.

For any localization scheme to be effective, it must be able to adapt over time as a CR adapts to its surroundings. In this paper an extended semi range-based localization (ESRB) scheme is proposed to accomplish this task. The proposed scheme estimates the position of a CR using the collaborative spectrum sensing results of a wireless radio frequency sensor network (WSN) in a CR environment. The central idea behind the proposed scheme is to exploit the relationships between spatial, frequency, and temporal parameters of the environment to solve for the position of the CR. The proposed scheme is modeled in the MATLAB programming language, and its efficacy is demonstrated through simulation. It is shown that over time the proposed scheme is capable of estimating the frequency band of operation and the location of a CR, and is thus capable of accounting for both frequency and spatial mobility inherent in the CR environment.","doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263764","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253016/6263669/06263764.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263764","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source localization in a cognitive radio environment consisting of frequency and spatial mobility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Source localization in a cognitive radio environment consisting of frequency and spatial mobility","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263764/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263764/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12933067","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source localization in a cognitive radio environment consisting of frequency and spatial mobility","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WSCORALSourceLocalizationinaCognitiveRadioEnvironm.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048863S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253016","isNumber":"6263669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253016","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6263669","articleId":"6263764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6263790,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Bonetto","affiliation":["DEI, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Bonetto","id":"38468095600"},{"name":"Nicola Bui","affiliation":["Consorzio Ferrara Ricerche, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Bui","id":"37391787600"},{"name":"Vishwas Lakkundi","affiliation":["Patavina Technologies, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Vishwas","lastName":"Lakkundi","id":"37299506100"},{"name":"Alexis Olivereau","affiliation":["Commissariat \u00e0 lEnergie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, Saclay, France"],"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Olivereau","id":"37708208700"},{"name":"Alexandru Serbanati","affiliation":["CATTID, University of Roma La Sapienza, Italy"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Serbanati","id":"38468261900"},{"name":"Michele Rossi","affiliation":["DEI, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37271350900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1239-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1238-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1237-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6263790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":3726},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Protocols","Authentication","Logic gates","Servers","Virtual private networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","Internet","protocols","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure communication","smart IoT objects","protocol stacks","security procedures","constrained IoT devices","security architecture","constrained communication stack","ISO/OSI model","end-to-end secure channels","IoT devices protection","encryption","authentication","security functionalities","unconstrained domains","computationally intensive operations","trusted unconstrained nodes","computationally intensive tasks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information Security","Internet of Things","Smart Objects","6LoWPAN","IPsec","IKEv2"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we discuss security procedures for constrained IoT devices.

The proposed method is lightweight and allows the protection of IoT devices through strong encryption and authentication means, so that constrained devices can benefit from the same security functionalities that are typical of unconstrained domains, without however having to execute computationally intensive operations. To make this possible, we advocate using trusted unconstrained nodes for the offloading of computationally intensive tasks.

In particular in case of bad network conditions, network and service providers have to trade off between these two impairment types, i.e. between the devil and the deep blue sea. In this paper we investigate this tradeoff in order to guide the design and development of Internet applications and network management approaches. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we quantify the impact of initial delays on the user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) for different application scenarios by means of subjective laboratory and crowdsourcing studies. We show that QoE for a given waiting time strongly depends on the concrete application at hand but that rating diversity remains fairly application-invariant. Secondly, using the example of YouTube video streaming we compare the influence of initial delays and interruptions (stallings) during watching. Our results demonstrate that users are extremely sensitive to interruptions and that services should be designed accordingly e.g. by increasing initial delay for prebuffering to overcome lack of resources.","doi":"10.1109/QoMEX.2012.6263849","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255875/6263832/06263849.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QoMEX.2012.6263849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Initial delay vs. interruptions: Between the devil and the deep blue sea","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Initial delay vs. interruptions: Between the devil and the deep blue sea","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263849/","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12932510","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Initial delay vs. interruptions: Between the devil and the deep blue sea","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074747S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255875","isNumber":"6263832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255875","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6263832","articleId":"6263849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6263888,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Thus, end-user quality perception in the context of interactive data services is dominated by waiting times; the longer the latter, the less satisfied the user becomes. As opposed to heavily researched multimedia experience, perception of waiting times is still not strongly explored in the context of Quality of Experience (QoE). This tutorial will contribute to closing this gap. In its first part, it addresses perception principles and discusses their applicability towards fundamental relationships between waiting times and resulting QoE. It then investigates to which extent the same relationships can also be used to describe QoE for more complex services such as web browsing. Finally, it discusses applications where waiting times determine QoE, amongst other factors. For example, the past shift from UDP media streaming to TCP media streaming (e.g. youtube.com) has extended the relevance of waiting times also to the domain of online video services. In particular, user-perceived quality suffers from initial delays when applications are launched, as well as from freezes during the delivery of the stream. These aspects, which have to be traded against each other to some extent, will be discussed mainly for HTTP video streaming in the last part of this tutorial.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Streaming media","Web pages","Humans","Tutorials","Psychology","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypermedia","interactive systems","Internet","multimedia computing","user interfaces","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waiting times","quality-of-experience","Web based services","e-mail browsing","online picture viewing","file downloads","end-user quality perception","interactive data services","multimedia experience","perception principles","Web browsing","UDP media streaming","TCP media streaming","online video services","HTTP video streaming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Waiting Time Perception","Web QoE","YouTube Video Streaming","Stalling","Initial Delay","QoE","Subjective Tests"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QoMEX.2012.6263888","startPage":"86","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255875/6263832/06263888.pdf","doi":"10.1109/QoMEX.2012.6263888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waiting times in quality of experience for web based services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Waiting times in quality of experience for web based services","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12932549","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6263888/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waiting times in quality of experience for web based services","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10008S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255875","isNumber":"6263832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255875","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6263832","articleId":"6263888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6263934,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfeng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38252668500"},{"name":"Patrick P.

To reduce the probability of data unavailability, it is important to recover the lost data of any failed storage node efficiently. In practice, storage nodes are of heterogeneous types and have different transmission bandwidths. Thus, traditional recovery solutions that simply minimize the number of data blocks being read may no longer be optimal in a heterogeneous environment. We propose a cost-based heterogeneous recovery (CHR) algorithm for RAID-6-coded storage systems. We formulate the recovery problem as an optimization model in which storage nodes are associated with generic costs. We narrow down the solution space of the model to make it practically tractable, while still achieving the global optimal solution in most cases. We implement different recovery algorithms and conduct testbed experiments on a real networked storage system with heterogeneous storage devices. We show that our CHR algorithm reduces the total recovery time of existing recovery solutions in various scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263934/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12933161","publicationDate":"June 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263934/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A cost-based heterogeneous recovery scheme for distributed storage systems with RAID-6 codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cost-based heterogeneous recovery scheme for distributed storage systems with RAID-6 codes","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081583S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253623","isNumber":"6263904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253623","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6263904","articleId":"6263934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6263949,"authors":[{"name":"Rami Melhem","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Melhem","id":"37273234900"},{"name":"Rakan Maddah","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Rakan","lastName":"Maddah","id":"37697676800"},{"name":"Sangyeun Cho","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sangyeun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37293575700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1625-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1624-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1623-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-3927"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0889"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1530-0889"}],"articleNumber":"6263949","dbTime":"121 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Noise measurement","Hardware","Radiation detectors","Random access memory","Computer architecture","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","error correction codes","fault diagnosis","fault tolerance","flash memories","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","phase change memories","probability","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RDIS","recursively defined invertible set scheme","multiple stuck-at fault tolerance","resistive memory","charge-based DRAM","flash memory","cell reliability","process variation","write endurance","faulty worn-out cells","robust error correction scheme","data retrieval","read time","failure probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error Correction Code","Hard Faults","Phase Change Memory","Fault Tolerance","Reliability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263949","abstract":"With their potential for high scalability and density, resistive memories are foreseen as a promising technology that overcomes the physical limitations confronted by charge-based DRAM and flash memory. Yet, a main burden towards the successful adoption and commercialization of resistive memories is their low cell reliability caused by process variation and limited write endurance. Typically, faulty and worn-out cells are permanently stuck at either `0' or `1'. To overcome the challenge, a robust error correction scheme that can recover from many hard faults is required. In this paper, we propose and evaluate RDIS, a novel scheme to efficiently tolerate memory stuck-at faults. RDIS allows for the correct retrieval of data by recursively determining and efficiently keeping track of the positions of the bits that are stuck at a value different from the ones that are written, and then, at read time, by inverting the values read from those positions. RDIS is characterized by a very low probability of failure that increases slowly with the relative increase in the number of faults. Moreover, RDIS tolerates many more faults than the best existing scheme-by up to 95% on average at the same overhead level.","publicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012)","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2012.6263949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2012.6263949","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253623/6263904/06263949.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RDIS: A recursively defined invertible set scheme to tolerate multiple stuck-at faults in resistive memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263949/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"RDIS: A recursively defined invertible set scheme to tolerate multiple stuck-at faults in resistive memory","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12933176","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263949/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RDIS: A recursively defined invertible set scheme to tolerate multiple stuck-at faults in resistive memory","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11839S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253623","isNumber":"6263904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253623","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6263904","articleId":"6263949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6263951,"authors":[{"name":"Ulya R.

Unfortunately, compared to the conventional Super-Threshold Computing (STC), NTC is more sensitive to process variations, which results in higher power consumption and lower frequencies than would otherwise be possible, and potentially a non-negligible fault rate. To help address variations at NTC at the architecture level, this paper presents the first microarchitectural model of process variations for NTC. The model, called VARIUS-NTV, extends the existing VARIUS variation model. Its key aspects include: (i) adopting a gate-delay model and an SRAM cell type that are tailored to NTC, (ii) modeling SRAM failure modes emerging at NTC, and (iii) accounting for the impact of leakage in SRAM models. We evaluate a simulated 11nm, 288-core tiled manycore at both NTC and STC. The results show higher frequency and power variations within the NTC chip. For example, the maximum difference in on-chip tile frequency is \u22482.3\u00d7 at STC and \u22483.7\u00d7 at NTC. We also validate our model against an experimental chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253623/6263904/06263951.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012)","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2012.6263951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2012.6263951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VARIUS-NTV: A microarchitectural model to capture the increased sensitivity of manycores to process variations at near-threshold voltages","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Delay","Random access memory","Mathematical model","Computer architecture","Logic gates","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","failure analysis","leakage currents","multiprocessing systems","performance evaluation","power aware computing","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VARIUS-NTV","microarchitectural model","many-core process variations","near-threshold voltages","near-threshold computing","energy-efficient computing","power consumption","VARIUS variation model","gate-delay model","SRAM failure mode modeling","simulated 288-core tiled manycore architecture evaluation","power variations","NTC chip","on-chip tile frequency","size 11 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Process variations","Near-threshold voltage","Manycore architectures","SRAM fault models","Power constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"VARIUS-NTV: A microarchitectural model to capture the increased sensitivity of manycores to process variations at near-threshold voltages","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6263951/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12933178","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VARIUS-NTV: A microarchitectural model to capture the increased sensitivity of manycores to process variations at near-threshold voltages","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150547S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253623","isNumber":"6263904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253623","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6263904","articleId":"6263951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6263955,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Shen","affiliation":["MOE KLNNIS Laboratory, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Shen","id":"38002527800"},{"name":"Zhongmin Cai","affiliation":["MOE KLNNIS Laboratory, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhongmin","lastName":"Cai","id":"37398888700"},{"name":"Xiaohong Guan","affiliation":["MOE KLNNIS Laboratory, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China","Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems and TNLIST Laboratory, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Guan","id":"37275635600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1625-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1624-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1623-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-3927"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0889"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1530-0889"}],"articleNumber":"6263955","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mice","Computers","Wheels","Encoding","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","human computer interaction","mouse controllers (computers)","pattern classification","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mouse dynamics","user identification","mouse operating characteristics","intrinsic behavioral variability","pattern growth-based mining method","frequent-behavior segment extraction","stable mouse characteristics","one-class classification algorithms","continuous user authentication","FAR","FRR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mouse dynamics","one-class learning","anomaly detection","pattern mining","human computer interaction"]}],"abstract":"Mouse dynamics is the process of identifying individual users based on their mouse operating characteristics. Although previous work has reported some promising results, mouse dynamics is still a newly emerging technique and has not reached an acceptable level of performance. One of the major reasons is intrinsic behavioral variability. This study presents a novel approach by using pattern-growth-based mining method to extract frequent-behavior segments in obtaining stable mouse characteristics, employing one-class classification algorithms to perform the task of continuous user authentication. Experimental results show that mouse characteristics extracted from frequent-behavior segments are much more stable than those from holistic behavior, and the approach achieves a practically useful level of performance with FAR of 0.37% and FRR of 1.12%. These findings suggest that mouse dynamics suffice to be a significant enhancement for a traditional authentication system.

These processes lead to increased gate delays, more failures during runtime and eventually reduced operational lifetime. Currently, to ensure correct functionality for a certain operational lifetime, additional timing margins are added to the design. However, this approach implies a significant performance loss and may fail to meet reliability requirements. Therefore, aging-aware microarchitecture design is inevitable. In this paper we present ExtraTime, a novel microarchitectural aging analysis framework, which can be used in early design phases when detailed transistor-level information is not yet available to model, analyze, and predict performance, power and aging. Furthermore, we show a comprehensive investigation using ExtraTime of various clock and power gating strategies as well as aging-aware instruction scheduling policies as a case study to show the impact of the architecture on aging.","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2012.6263957","publicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253623/6263904/06263957.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2012.6263957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263904","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ExtraTime: Modeling and analysis of wearout due to transistor aging at microarchitecture-level","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ExtraTime: Modeling and analysis of wearout due to transistor aging at microarchitecture-level","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263957/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12933184","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6263957/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ExtraTime: Modeling and analysis of wearout due to transistor aging at microarchitecture-level","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149776S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253623","isNumber":"6263904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253623","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6263904","articleId":"6263957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6263958,"authors":[{"name":"Yubin Xia","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China","Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Yubin Xia","id":"37087192683"},{"name":"Yutao Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China","Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Yutao Liu","id":"37087193309"},{"name":"Haibo Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539848500"},{"name":"Binyu Zang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China"],"firstName":"Binyu","lastName":"Zang","id":"37540644700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1625-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1624-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1623-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-3927"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0889"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1530-0889"}],"articleNumber":"6263958","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1298},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6263958","abstract":"Many classic and emerging security attacks usually introduce illegal control flow to victim programs. This paper proposes an approach to detecting violation of control flow integrity based on hardware support for performance monitoring in modern processors. The key observation is that the abnormal control flow in security breaches can be precisely captured by performance monitoring units. Based on this observation, we design and implement a system called CFIMon, which is the first non-intrusive system that can detect and reason about a variety of attacks violating control flow integrity without any changes to applications (either source or binary code) or requiring special-purpose hardware. CFIMon combines static analysis and runtime training to collect legal control flow transfers, and leverages the branch tracing store mechanism in commodity processors to collect and analyze runtime traces on-the-fly to detect violation of control flow integrity. Security evaluation shows that CFIMon has low false positives or false negatives when detecting several realistic security attacks. Performance results show that CFIMon incurs only 6.1% performance overhead on average for a set of typical server applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Law","Security","Program processors","Runtime","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CFIMon","control flow integrity violation detection","performance counters","illegal control flow","victim programs","security attacks","hardware support","abnormal control flow capture","security breaches","performance monitoring units","nonintrusive system","static analysis","runtime training","legal control flow transfer collection","branch tracing store mechanism","commodity processors","runtime traces on-the-fly collection","runtime traces on-the-fly analysis","server applications"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6263904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2012.6263958","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253623/6263904/06263958.pdf","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2012.6263958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CFIMon: Detecting violation of control flow integrity using performance counters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CFIMon: Detecting violation of control flow integrity using performance counters","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12933185","publicationDate":"June 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6263958/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6263958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFIMon: Detecting violation of control flow integrity using performance counters","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078117S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253623","isNumber":"6263904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253623","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6263904","articleId":"6263958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6264050,"authors":[{"name":"George Kousiouris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Zografou, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/6679380/6264050/6264050-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["George Kousiouris received a diploma in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Patras, Greece, in 2005 and the PhD degree in grid and cloud computing from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), in March 2012.

Furthermore, a variety of software toolkits exist that implement an extended set of algorithms applicable to workload forecasting. However, their automated use as services in the distributed computing paradigm includes a number of design and implementation challenges. In this paper, a decoupled framework is presented, for taking advantage of software like GNU Octave in the process of creating and using prediction models during the service life cycle of a SOI. A performance analysis of the framework is also conducted. In this context, a methodology for creating parametric or gearbox services with multiple modes of operations based on the execution conditions is portrayed and is applied to transform the aforementioned service framework to optimize service performance. A new estimation algorithm is introduced, that creates performance rules of applications as black boxes, through the creation and usage of genetically optimized artificial neural networks. Through this combination, the critical parameters of the networks are decided through an evolutionary iterative process.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2012.21","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/6679380/06264050.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2012.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6679380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric Design and Performance Analysis of a Decoupled Service-Oriented Prediction Framework Based on Embedded Numerical Software","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Parametric Design and Performance Analysis of a Decoupled Service-Oriented Prediction Framework Based on Embedded Numerical Software","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13952249","htmlLink":"/document/6264050/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Design and Performance Analysis of a Decoupled Service-Oriented Prediction Framework Based on Embedded Numerical Software","sourcePdf":"tsc2013040511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10141S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"6679380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6679380","articleId":"6264050","onlineDate":"09 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6264068,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Wei Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Graduate Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6518158/6264068/6264068-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hung-Wei Chiu (M'09) was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

The implantable stimulator is a high-Q class-E driver that delivers a sine-wave pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) stimulation, which was verified to have a superior efficacy in pain relief to a square wave. The proposed duty-cycle-controlled class-E PRF driver designed with a high-Q factor has two operational modes that are able to achieve 100% DC-AC conversion, and involves only one switched series inductor and an unchanged parallel capacitor. The measured output amplitude under low-voltage (LV) mode using a 22% duty cycle was 0.98 V with 91% efficiency, and under high-voltage (HV) mode using a 47% duty cycle was 2.95 V with 92% efficiency. These modes were inductively controlled by a duty-cycle detector, which can detect the duty-cycle modulated signal generated from the external complementary low-Q class-E power amplifier (PA). The design methodology of the low-Q inductive interface for a non-50% duty cycle is presented. The experimental results exhibits that the 1.5-V PA that consumes DC power of 14.21 mW was able to deliver a 2.9-V sine wave to a 500 \u03a9 load. The optimal 60% drain efficiency of the system from the PA to the load was obtained at a 10-mm coupling distance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6264068/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13529104","pubMedId":"23853324","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Mode Highly Efficient Class-E Stimulator Controlled by a Low-Q Class-E Power Amplifier Through Duty Cycle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Mode Highly Efficient Class-E Stimulator Controlled by a Low-Q Class-E Power Amplifier Through Duty Cycle","sourcePdf":"tbcas-chiu-2205245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116651S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"6518158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6518158","articleId":"6264068","onlineDate":"09 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6264071,"authors":[{"name":"Sanne Elling","affiliation":["Utrecht Institute of Linguistics (UIL-OTS), University of Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Sanne Elling is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Utrecht Institute of Linguistics (UIL-OTS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.

However, there is still debate about the validity of the method, partly focusing on the usefulness and exhaustiveness of participants' verbalizations. The rise of eye-tracking technology sheds new light on this discussion, as participants' working processes can now be observed in more detail. Research questions: (1) What kinds of verbalizations do participants produce, and how do they relate to the information that can be directly observed using eye tracking? (2) What do eye movements reveal about cognitive processes at times when participants stop verbalizing? Literature review: Our study replicates an earlier study by Cooke (2010), who used a combination of CTA protocols and eye tracking in a small sample with experienced and highly educated participants to investigate the validity of CTA. Cooke's results suggest that the additional value of participants' verbalizations is limited: at least 77% of the verbalizations referred to things that could be easily observed with eye tracking. Methodology: We conducted a study in which 60 participants with different characteristics performed tasks on informational websites. During their task performance, they verbalized their thoughts, and simultaneously their eye movements were measured. The resulting think-aloud protocols were divided in verbalization units, which were coded into content types. Silences were registered, and eye movements during these silences were analyzed. Results and discussion: We found a different distribution of verbalization types than Cooke (2010) reported, with far more verbalizations where participants formulated doubts, judgments on the website, or expressions of frustration. In our study, verbalizations provided a substantial contribution in addition to the directly observable user problems. We measured a rather high percentage of silences (27%), during which participants most often were scanning pages for information. During these silences, interesting observations could be made about users' processes and obstacles on the website. The implication of our study is that we now have a better understanding of the types of verbalizations that a CTA evaluation might generate. Further, we know that relevant usability observations can be made during silences. A limitation is that we do not know yet the influence of specific characteristics of the evaluation setting on the types of verbalizations and silences. Future research should focus on the influence of evaluation settings on the outcomes of an evaluation, in particular, the influence of characteristics of the participants who are involved in the study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264071/","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6264071/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12933538","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Combining Concurrent Think-Aloud Protocols and Eye-Tracking Observations: An Analysis of Verbalizations and Silences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Concurrent Think-Aloud Protocols and Eye-Tracking Observations: An Analysis of Verbalizations and Silences","sourcePdf":"tpc-elling-2206190-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080855S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"47","isNumber":"6276341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"47","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6276341","articleId":"6264071","onlineDate":"09 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6264075,"authors":[{"name":"P\u00e4ivikki Repo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"P\u00e4ivikki","lastName":"Repo","id":"38542046300"},{"name":"Antti Haarahiltunen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Haarahiltunen","id":"38299240700"},{"name":"Lauri Sainiemi","affiliation":["Division of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland","Microsoft, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Lauri","lastName":"Sainiemi","id":"37705532100"},{"name":"Marko Yli-Koski","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Yli-Koski","id":"38540069900"},{"name":"Heli Talvitie","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Heli","lastName":"Talvitie","id":"38530458700"},{"name":"Martin C.

We utilize cache access locality and error-free resources in a cost-effective manner. First, we classify cache lines into fully and partially accessed groups and apply appropriate methods to each group. For the partially accessed group, we propose a method of matching memory access behavior and error locations with intra-cache line word-level remapping. In order to reduce the area overhead used to store the cache access information history, we present an access pattern-learning line-fill buffer (LFB). For the fully accessed group, we propose the utilization of error-free assist functions in the cache, i.e., a LFB and victim cache with no process variation-induced error at the target minimum supply voltage. We also present an error-aware prefetch method that allows us to utilize the error-free victim cache to achieve a further reduction in cache misses due to faulty resources.

To increase the frame rate, parallel beamforming is a commonly used technique for fast cardiac imaging. Conventionally, a 4 multiple-line-acquisition (4MLA) system increases the frame rate by a factor of 4, making use of a broadened transmit beam to reduce block-like artifacts. As an alternative, it has been proposed to transmit an unfocused beam (i.e., plane wave or diverging wave) for which a large number of parallel receive beams (i.e., 16) can be formed for each transmit. However, to keep the spatial resolution acceptable in these approaches, spatial compounding of overlapping successive transmits is required. As a result, the effective gain in frame rate is similar to that of a 4MLA system. To date, it remains unclear how conventional 4MLA compares to plane-wave or diverging-wave imaging when operating at similar frame rate. The goal of this study was therefore to directly contrast the performance of these beamforming methods by computer simulation. In this study, the performance of 4 different imaging systems was investigated by quantitatively evaluating the characteristics of their beam profiles. The results showed that the conventional 4MLA and plane wave imaging were very competitive imaging strategies when operating at a similar frame rate. 4MLA performed better in the near field (i.e., 10 to 50 mm), whereas plane-wave imaging had better beam profiles in the far field (i.e., 50 to 90 mm). Although diverging-wave imaging had the poorest performance in the present study, it could potentially be improved by optimizing the settings.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6264119/06264130.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264119","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of conventional parallel beamforming with plane wave and diverging wave imaging for cardiac applications: a simulation study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6264130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of conventional parallel beamforming with plane wave and diverging wave imaging for cardiac applications: a simulation study","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2012","pubMedId":"22899113","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6264130/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of conventional parallel beamforming with plane wave and diverging wave imaging for cardiac applications: a simulation study","sourcePdf":"t1281654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059633S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6264119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6264119","articleId":"6264130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6264142,"authors":[{"name":"Hayrettin Koymen","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6264119/6264142/6264142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hayrettin K\u00f6ymen received the B.Sc. and M.

The force model is rederived so that the energy and power is preserved in the equivalent circuit model. The model is able to predict the entire behavior of CMUT until the membrane touches the substrate. Many intrinsic properties of the CMUT cell, such as the collapse condition, collapse voltage, the voltage\u2013displacement interrelation and the force equilibrium before and after collapse voltage in the presence of external static force, are obtained as a direct consequence of the model. The small signal equivalent circuit for any bias condition is obtained from the large signal model. The model can be implemented in circuit simulation tools and model predictions are in excellent agreement with finite element method simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6264119/06264142.pdf","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved lumped element nonlinear circuit model for a circular CMUT cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6264142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264142/","displayDocTitle":"An improved lumped element nonlinear circuit model for a circular CMUT cell","volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2012","pubMedId":"22899125","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6264142/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved lumped element nonlinear circuit model for a circular CMUT cell","sourcePdf":"t1281791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071118S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6264119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6264119","articleId":"6264142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6264143,"authors":[{"name":"Shuji Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Nanomechanics, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6264119/6264143/6264143-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuji Tanaka (M'07) received B.E., M.E., and Dr.E. degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1994, 1996, and 1999, respectively. from 1996 to 1999, he was a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

However, thanks to a wide range of parameter configurations, the DVB-T2 standard is also well-suited for mobile reception, which is currently evaluated in a field trial with DVB-T2 in the northern part of Germany. As no mobile measurement receivers are available, we developed the world's first software-based mobile DVB-T2 measurement receiver for evaluating the performance of DVB-T2 within this field trial. Besides the decoding of the Transport Stream, the receiver is also able to measure detailed transmission channel characteristics and link them to their geographical position using GPS data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6264238/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12934098","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A software-based mobile DVB-T2 measurement receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A software-based mobile DVB-T2 measurement receiver","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MM12021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057593S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255877","isNumber":"6264224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255877","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6264224","articleId":"6264238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6264246,"authors":[{"name":"Seunghwan Choi","affiliation":["Digital Transmission Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seunghwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37715827000"},{"name":"Jong-Seob Baek","affiliation":["Digital Transmission Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Seob","lastName":"Baek","id":"37288653000"},{"name":"Jong-Soo Seo","affiliation":["Digital Transmission Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Soo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292426500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0293-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0294-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-504"}],"articleNumber":"6264246","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Digital video broadcasting","Antennas","Gain","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","diversity reception","encoding","MIMO communication","multiplexing","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-polarized MIMO transmission analysis","digital terrestrial broadcasting systems","multipath Ricean fading channel","polarization division multiplexing","diversity technologies","second generation terrestrial digital video broadcasting","DVB-T2 evolution","distributed space-frequency code","dual-polarized multiinput multioutput mode","cross-polarization discrimination","XPD","polarized MIMO zero-forcing","ZF combined successive cancelation","ZF-SIC detections","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","MIMO ZF detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the polarization division multiplexing (PDM) and diversity technologies for the second generation terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T2) evolution. The polarization diversity is built upon two sets of distributed space-frequency coded (SFC) and dual-polarized multi-input multi-output (MIMO) mode. In particular, we analyze a depolarization effect caused by a cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) by considering the polarized MIMO zero-forcing (ZF) and ZF combined with a successive cancelation (ZF-SIC) detections. From an approximate analysis of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in terms of XPD, it is shown that the output SINR of MIMO ZF detection increases as an absolute XPD increases. It is also shown that the output SINR of ZF-SIC detection converges to that of ZF detection as the absolute XPD increases.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264246","publicationTitle":"IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255877/6264224/06264246.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of dual-polarized MIMO transmission for digital terrestrial broadcasting systems over multipath Ricean fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6264246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264246/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of dual-polarized MIMO transmission for digital terrestrial broadcasting systems over multipath Ricean fading channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12934106","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6264246/","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of dual-polarized MIMO transmission for digital terrestrial broadcasting systems over multipath Ricean fading channel","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MM12031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057414S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255877","isNumber":"6264224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255877","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6264224","articleId":"6264246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6264248,"authors":[{"name":"Lorena Mart\u00ednez","affiliation":["Electronics and Computing Department, University of Mondragon, Arrasate-Mondragon, Spain"],"firstName":"Lorena","lastName":"Mart\u00ednez","id":"37400842000"},{"name":"Pello Ochandiano","affiliation":["Electronics and Computing Department, University of Mondragon, Arrasate-Mondragon, Spain"],"firstName":"Pello","lastName":"Ochandiano","id":"37596568800"},{"name":"Iker Sobr\u00f3n","affiliation":["Electronics and Computing Department, University of Mondragon, Arrasate-Mondragon, Spain"],"firstName":"Iker","lastName":"Sobr\u00f3n","id":"37391630900"},{"name":"Mikel Mendicute","affiliation":["Electronics and Computing Department, University of Mondragon, Arrasate-Mondragon, Spain"],"firstName":"Mikel","lastName":"Mendicute","id":"37391629300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0293-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0294-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-504"}],"articleNumber":"6264248","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":250},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6264248","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Digital video broadcasting","OFDM","Receivers","Doppler effect","Bit error rate","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital video broadcasting","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","signal detection","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative BEM channel estimation","BP detection","ICI cancellation","DVB systems","terrestrial television broadcasting","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM transmission","intercarrier interference","time-varying channel estimation","belief-propagation based ICI-aware detector","iterative receiver architecture","soft information transfer","complex-exponential CE-BEM channel estimator","clustered frequency-domain pilots","iteration patterns","optimized pilot clusters design","basis expansion model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","time-varying channels","interference cancellation","DVB-T2","DVB-NGH"]}],"abstract":"Modern terrestrial television broadcasting, which is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, suffers from inter-carrier interference (ICI) in time-varying channels, due to the loss of orthogonality among subcarriers. This ICI term, which cannot be neglected in middle and high mobility scenarios, can even offer increased diversity if it is correctly processed by the detector, which requires a good knowledge of the complete channel, including ICI. In recent years, BEM has been successfully employed to model and estimate time-varying channels using clustered frequency-domain pilots. In this paper, we propose to combine a complex-exponential CE-BEM channel estimator with a belief-propagation based ICI-aware detector in an iterative (turbo) receiver architecture. The soft information transfer among the different receiver blocks, the iteration patterns and the design of optimized pilot clusters are analyzed for high-mobility scenarios. Simulation results show the very good performance of the proposed novel joint algorithm that not only cancels ICI, but also can benefit from the diversity it introduces, providing specially good results under high mobility scenarios.","publicationTitle":"IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255877/6264224/06264248.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative BEM channel estimation and BP detection for ICI cancellation in DVB systems with very high mobility","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Iterative BEM channel estimation and BP detection for ICI cancellation in DVB systems with very high mobility","htmlLink":"/document/6264248/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12934108","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative BEM channel estimation and BP detection for ICI cancellation in DVB systems with very high mobility","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MM12036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058998S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255877","isNumber":"6264224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255877","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6264224","articleId":"6264248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6264256,"authors":[{"name":"Fatimaalzhra Salman","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Design, Brunel University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Fatimaalzhra","lastName":"Salman","id":"38468173300"},{"name":"John Cosmas","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Design, Brunel University, London, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Cosmas","id":"37284216900"},{"name":"Yue Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292464800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0293-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0294-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-504"}],"articleNumber":"6264256","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling and performance of a DVB-T2 channel estimator and equaliser for different pilot patterns","abstract":"In this paper the performance of a pilot aided channel estimator and equalizer for DVB-T2 for the 8 different pilot patterns are explore.

scheme that mitigates cross-tier and inter-femto interference. To mitigate the cross-tier interference, the neighboring area where the macro mobile station (MMS) is regarded as neighboring MMS (NMMS) is decided according to the average signal-to-interference-ratio (ASIR) threshold; then the total spectrum resource is partitioned by the femtocell and its NMMS. Subsequently, RA for each femto-cell is implemented as a strategic non-cooperative game by which the inter-femto interference is mitigated. Simulation results show that better performance can be achieved in terms of macrocell throughput, femtocell throughput on each subcarrier, MMS and femto mobile station (FMS) CDF of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), with negligible femtocell throughput sacrifice.","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264260","publicationTitle":"IEEE international Symposium on Broadband

for Chinese Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) system is proposed. With the consideration of the back compatibility with Chinese Single Input Single Output (SISO) DTMB standard, the adopted frame structure is carefully designed over multiple antennas. The modified time domain correlation channel estimation with frame heads adopted cyclic pseudorandom noise (PN) sequences is addressed for MISO DTMB frequency selective settings. A simple close-form solution about channel estimation can be acquired by constructing linear equation. In order to transform the data from channel output into decoding in the frequency domain, the tail cancellation and cyclic reconstruction (TCCR) process is described briefly. Simulation results indicate that the proposed channel estimation scheme can achieve the same performance as the recently proposed channel estimation with iterative interference cancellation but with a significant complexity reduction.","publicationTitle":"IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255877/6264224/06264284.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified channel estimation scheme for Chinese MISO DTMB systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"A simplified channel estimation scheme for Chinese MISO DTMB systems","htmlLink":"/document/6264284/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12934143","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified channel estimation scheme for Chinese MISO DTMB systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MM12089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081974S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255877","isNumber":"6264224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255877","xplore-issue":"6264224","articleId":"6264284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6264305,"authors":[{"name":"Yaqi Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Yaqi","lastName":"Li","id":"38468196900"},{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279239700"},{"name":"Bo Rong","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Canada"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Rong","id":"37284111200"},{"name":"Yiyan Wu","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Canada"],"firstName":"Yiyan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281231400"},{"name":"Gilles Gagnon","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Canada"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Gagnon","id":"37290454000"},{"name":"Lin Gui","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Gui","id":"37409860500"},{"name":"Wenjun Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278428800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0295-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0293-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0294-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5052"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5044"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-504"}],"articleNumber":"6264305","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6264305","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Decoding","Product codes","Signal to noise ratio","Digital TV","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive decoding","computational complexity","digital television","mobile television","parity check codes","product codes","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC-RS product codes","mobile DTV","terrestrial DTV system","spectrum efficiency","reliability","adaptive decoding algorithm","error estimation","soft value modification","EE approach","SVM approach","random-burst errors","computational complexity","low density parity check code","Reed-Solomon code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC-RS product code","mobile DTV","green transmission"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an LDPC-RS product codes for the future terrestrial DTV system, which has to face an increasing demand of high spectrum efficiency and reliability.

Double cage induction motors are commonly used for applications where successive loaded starts-up are mandatory. Experimental results were performed under healthy and faulty cases, and for different load conditions using each technique. Rotor broken bars fault detection based on sideband current components may fails due to the presence of inter bar currents that reduce the degree of rotor asymmetry, yielding to a decrease of the magnitude of these spectral components. But inter bar currents produce core vibrations in the axial direction, which can be detected using vibration analysis, in order to overcomes the limits of the classical (MCSA) in this condition.","doi":"10.1109/SPEEDAM.2012.6264465","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Power Electronics Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Power Electronics Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253398/6264368/06264465.pdf","startPage":"1360","endPage":"1365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPEEDAM.2012.6264465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264368","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6264465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of motor current signature and vibration analysis for diagnosing rotor broken bars in double cage induction motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of motor current signature and vibration analysis for diagnosing rotor broken bars in double cage induction motors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6264465/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12934748","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of motor current signature and vibration analysis for diagnosing rotor broken bars in double cage induction motors","confLoc":"Sorrento, Italy","sourcePdf":"EMD0353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0511S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253398","isNumber":"6264368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253398","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6264368","articleId":"6264465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-18"},{"_id":6264469,"authors":[{"name":"J.

attention on energy autonomous sensing and computing systems which can operate unattended tens of years, have made energy harvesting and power conversion techniques key technologies for the future. The goal is to power systems nearly perpetually if the scavenger is exposed to reasonable environmental energy conditions. However, the system is still threatened to run out of energy, if a prolonged lack of energy intake happens. The last frontiers of perpetual operating systems is combining cutting edge technologies for energy generation from the environment and long-term and green energy supply using small factor fuel cells with few cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n. In this paper we introduce an hybrid power architecture which improves embedded systems power availability. We present a Smart Power Unit (SPU) that is a power supply architecture which manages both energy harvesting and novel fuel cells technologies. SPU provide an efficient air-flow and solar energy harvesting stage and a hydrogen micro fuel cell interface. Each harvester stores energy in a local supercapacitor and, when full, a lithium-ion battery is charged. Micro fuel cell acts as reservoir source for recharging battery in low environmental power condition. The core of the SPU is the microcontroller based power manager that exploits MPPT, energy prevision, battery monitoring and communications with user node.","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Power Electronics Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Power Electronics Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253398/6264368/06264533.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"951","doi":"10.1109/SPEEDAM.2012.6264533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPEEDAM.2012.6264533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Harvester architecture with hybrid storage devices and smart capabilities for low power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Harvester architecture with hybrid storage devices and smart capabilities for low power systems","htmlLink":"/document/6264533/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12934815","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Harvester architecture with hybrid storage devices and smart capabilities for low power systems","confLoc":"Sorrento, Italy","sourcePdf":"PEC0103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062666S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253398","isNumber":"6264368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253398","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6264368","articleId":"6264533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6264543,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, to increase the realism of validation, the real-time model has to reach a high level of accuracy. This objective is balanced by, among others, the computational time ensured by the used digital technology. This is one of the main reasons why Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices are preferred. The proposed paper summarizes the hardware FPGA design of PECs real-time model. The Associate Discrete Circuit (ADC) modeling technique is used for each power switch. To make the necessary functional validation, the Matlab/Simulink SimPowerSystems based model has been taken as a reference design. The proposed case study consists of a H-bridge DC-AC converter that supplies an AC load with a sinusoidal back-EMF. The corresponding FPGA-based real-time model is validated at open loop condition and at closed loop with a digital current controller. In addition to functional simulation results, real-time Hardware In the Loop (HIL) simulation results are provided.","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Power Electronics Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Power Electronics Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253398/6264368/06264543.pdf","startPage":"658","endPage":"663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPEEDAM.2012.6264543","doi":"10.1109/SPEEDAM.2012.6264543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of Power Electronic Converter real-time model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of Power Electronic Converter real-time model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264543/","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6264543/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12934825","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of Power Electronic Converter real-time model","confLoc":"Sorrento, Italy","sourcePdf":"PEC0191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068299S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253398","isNumber":"6264368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253398","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6264368","articleId":"6264543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6264594,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Among those solutions is the control of fully rated converters, blade pitch angle control and capacitor sizing.

When such a failure occurs, rollback and recovery is used so that the execution can resume from the last checkpointed state. The goal is to minimize the expected execution time, and we have to decide in which order to execute the tasks, and whether to checkpoint or not after the completion of each given task. We show that this scheduling problem is strongly NP-complete, and propose a (polynomial-time) dynamic programming algorithm for the case where the application graph is a linear chain. These results lay the theoretical foundations of the problem, and constitute a prerequisite before discussing scheduling strategies for arbitrary DAGS of moldable tasks subject to general failure distributions.","doi":"10.1109/DSNW.2012.6264675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255871/6264647/06264675.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSNW.2012.6264675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6264647","publicationTitle":"IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN 2012)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the complexity of scheduling checkpoints for computational workflows","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6264675/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12934066","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6264675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complexity of scheduling checkpoints for computational workflows","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06394S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255871","isNumber":"6264647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255871","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6264647","articleId":"6264675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6264676,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin A.

In suburban areas, a common deployment model relies on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) communications between mesh routers (MRs), with one MR installed at each user premises. In this paper, we investigate a possible user cooperation path to implement strategic resource allocation in OFDMA WMNs, under the assumption that users want to control their interconnections. In this case, a novel strategic situation appears: How much an MR can demand, how much it can obtain, and how this shall depend on the interference with its neighbors. Strategic interference management and resource allocation mechanisms are needed to avoid performance degradation during congestion cases between MRs. In this paper, we model the problem as a bankruptcy game taking into account the interference between MRs. We identify possible solutions from cooperative game theory, namely the Shapley value and the nucleolus, and show through extensive simulations of realistic scenarios that they outperform two state-of-the-art OFDMA allocation schemes, namely, centralized-dynamic frequency planning, and frequency-ALOHA. In particular, the nucleolus solution offers best performance overall in terms of throughput and fairness, at a lower time complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nucleolus-Based Approach for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Wireless Mesh Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.177","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6604394/06265054.pdf","startPage":"2145","endPage":"2154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265054/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Nucleolus-Based Approach for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Wireless Mesh Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6265054/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795116","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nucleolus-Based Approach for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2013112145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065625S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6604394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6604394","articleId":"6265054","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6265055,"authors":[{"name":"Xianfu Chen","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6604394/6265055/6265055-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xianfu Chen received the PhD degree in signal and information processing from the Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in March 2012.

One of the critical challenges for operating such radios in a network is how to efficiently allocate transmission powers and frequency resource among the secondary users (SUs) while satisfying the quality-of-service constraints of the primary users. In this paper, we focus on the noncooperative power allocation problem in cognitive wireless mesh networks formed by a number of clusters with the consideration of energy efficiency. Due to the SUs' dynamic and spontaneous properties, the problem is modeled as a stochastic learning process. We first extend the single-agent Q-learning to a multiuser context, and then propose a conjecture-based multiagent Q-learning algorithm to achieve the optimal transmission strategies with only private and incomplete information. An intelligent SU performs Q-function updates based on the conjecture over the other SUs' stochastic behaviors. This learning algorithm provably converges given certain restrictions that arise during the learning procedure. Simulation experiments are used to verify the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness of improving the energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.178","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6604394/06265055.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"2155","endPage":"2166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Power Adaptation with Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Power Adaptation with Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265055/","volume":"12","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6265055/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795129","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Power Adaptation with Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2013112155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108057S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6604394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6604394","articleId":"6265055","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6265332,"authors":[{"name":"Ze Dong","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ze","lastName":"Dong","id":"37307982000"},{"name":"Xinying Li","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Beijing, China","Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinying","lastName":"Li","id":"37406889700"},{"name":"Jianjun Yu","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278392400"},{"name":"Nan Chi","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Chi","id":"37277684500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"6265332","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":836},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"The Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing technique enable a solution to achieve high spectral efficiency in long-haul transmission system. Compare to polarization division multiplexing quadrature-phase-shift-keying, even high-level modulation scheme such as polarization division multiplexing 16-quadrature-amplitude-modulation is much more sensitive to intra-channel noise and inter-channel linear crosstalk caused by Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing. We experimentally demonstrated the generation and transmission of the 6 \u00d7 128-Gb/s Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing sixteen quadrature amplitude modulation signal over 1200-km single-mode fiber (SMF)-28 with Erbium-doped fiber amplifier only amplification with a net SE of 7.47 b/s/Hz, which is so far, to our knowledge, the highest SE for the signal with the bit rate above 100-Gb/s using the polarization-division multiplexing 16-quadrature-amplitude-modulation format. This experiment was successfully enabled by digital-signal-processing (DSP) pre-equalization of transmitter-side impairments and DSP post-equalization of the channel and receiver-side impairments. Nyquist-band is considered in the pre- equalization to enhance the tolerance of the polarization-division multiplexing 16-quadrature-amplitude-modulation to the aggressive spectral shaping.

Through the randomization and average of the pulsewidth and the reduction of current mismatch, the frequency synthesizer can reduce the ripples on the control voltage of the voltage-controlled oscillator in order to reduce the reference spur at the output of the phase-locked loop. A random clock generator is used to perform a random selection control. The loop bandwidth of the system can be adjusted by the control voltage so as to reduce the locking time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spur-reduction techniques, a 2.5 GHz to 2.7 GHz FLPLL was designed and fabricated using a TSMC 90-nm CMOS process. The proposed circuit can achieve a phase noise of -114 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 1 MHz and reference spurs below -74 dBc.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6359940/06265345.pdf","startPage":"2815","endPage":"2824","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Pulsewidth Matching Frequency Synthesizer With Sub-Sampling Charge Pump","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Random Pulsewidth Matching Frequency Synthesizer With Sub-Sampling Charge Pump","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6265345/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13146664","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Pulsewidth Matching Frequency Synthesizer With Sub-Sampling Charge Pump","sourcePdf":"tcsi-hung-2206462-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072185S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6359940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6359940","articleId":"6265345","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6265346,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Zheng Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6339093/6265346/6265346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jason Zheng Jiang (M'10) received the B.

This question was studied but not fully resolved in the classical electrical circuit literature. Renewed interest in this question arises in the synthesis of passive mechanical impedances. Recent work by the authors has introduced the concept of a regular positive-real functions. It was shown that five-element networks are capable of realizing all regular and some (but not all) nonregular biquadratic positive-real functions. Accordingly, the focus of this paper is on the realizability of nonregular biquadratics. It will be shown that the only six-element series-parallel networks which are capable of realizing nonregular biquadratic impedances are those with three reactive elements or four reactive elements. We identify a set of networks that can realize all the nonregular biquadratic functions for each of the two cases. The realizability conditions for the networks are expressed in terms of a canonical form for biquadratics. The nonregular realizable region for each of the networks is explicitly characterized.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6339093/06265346.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339093","startPage":"2543","endPage":"2554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Series-Parallel Six-Element Synthesis of Biquadratic Impedances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Series-Parallel Six-Element Synthesis of Biquadratic Impedances","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265346/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13100476","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6265346/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Series-Parallel Six-Element Synthesis of Biquadratic Impedances","sourcePdf":"tcsi-smith-2206492-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192895S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6339093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6339093","articleId":"6265346","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6265357,"authors":[{"name":"Juan F.

Dynamics in full envelope is modeled, with uncertainties represented by the system model error and process noise. The model error depends on both helicopter dynamics and flight mode, and the process noise is assumed unknown but bounded. Based on the set-membership filter, an active modeling based stationary increment predictive control, based on the estimated model error and its boundary to optimally compensate the model error, as well as the aerodynamics time delay, is proposed. The proposed method has been implemented on the ServoHeli-40 unmanned helicopter platform and experimentally tested; the results have demonstrated its effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265383/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13566271","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6265383/","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Active Model-Based Predictive Control and Experimental Investigation on Unmanned Helicopters in Full Flight Envelope","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Model-Based Predictive Control and Experimental Investigation on Unmanned Helicopters in Full Flight Envelope","sourcePdf":"tcst-song-2208968-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082898S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6532340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6532340","articleId":"6265383","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":6265386,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Jian Li","affiliation":["College of Sciences, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37579032000"},{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Guang-Hong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290182400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"6265386","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":999},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Switches","Symmetric matrices","Nonlinear systems","Attenuation","Educational institutions","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","H\u221e control","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching-type H\u221e filter design","T-S fuzzy system","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system","membership function","fuzzy system","nonlinear system","parallel distributed compensator strategy","switching mechanism","filter gain","disturbance attenuation performance","simple fixed-gain filter design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["$H_{\\infty }$ filter","membership functions","switching filter","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n filter design problem for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with unknown or partially unknown membership functions.

Unlike the traditional buck-type voltage source inverter (VSI), the SBI can produce an ac output voltage that is either greater or less than the available dc input voltage. Also, the SBI exhibits better electromagnetic interference noise immunity when compared to the VSI, which enables compact design of the power converter. Another advantage of SBI is that it can supply both dc and ac loads simultaneously from a single dc input. These features make the SBI suitable for dc nanogrid applications. In this paper, the SBI is proposed as a power electronic interface in dc nanogrid. The structure and advantages of the proposed SBI-based nanogrid are discussed in detail. This paper also presents a dq synchronous-reference-frame-based controller for SBI, which regulates both dc and ac bus voltages of the nanogrid to their respective reference values under steady state as well as under dynamic load variation in the nanogrid. The control system of SBI has been experimentally validated using a 0.5-kW laboratory prototype of the SBI supplying both dc and ac loads simultaneously, and the relevant experimental results are given in this paper. The low cross regulation and the dynamic performance of the control system have also been verified experimentally for a 20% step change in either dc or ac load of SBI. These experimental results confirm the suitability of the SBI and its closed-loop control strategy for dc nanogrid applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265407/","volume":"28","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6265407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13038977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous-Reference-Frame-Based Control of Switched Boost Inverter for Standalone DC Nanogrid Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous-Reference-Frame-Based Control of Switched Boost Inverter for Standalone DC Nanogrid Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-adda-2211039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085914S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6330009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6330009","articleId":"6265407","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6265408,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Gu","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6330009/6265408/6265408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Gu (S\u201911) received the B.S. degree from Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China, in 2002, and the M.S. degree from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2005.

The proposed converter provides wide zero-voltage-switching range in the leading-leg switches, achieves zero-current-switching for lagging-leg switches, and uses a hybrid-switching method to avoid freewheeling circulating losses in the primary side. Because the resonant capacitor voltage of the hybrid-switching circuit is applied between the bridge rectifier and the output inductor for the duration of the freewheeling intervals, a smaller sized output inductor can be utilized. With the current rectifier diode of the hybrid-switching circuit providing a clamping path, the voltage overshoots that arise during the turn-off of the rectifier diodes are eliminated and the voltage stress of bridge rectifier is clamped to the minimal achievable value, which is equal to secondary-reflected input voltage of the transformer. The inductive energy stored in the output inductor and the capacitive energy stored in the resonant capacitor of the hybrid-switching circuit are transferred to the output simultaneously during the freewheeling intervals with only one diode in series in the current path, achieving more effective and efficient energy transfer. The effectiveness of the proposed converter was experimentally verified using a 3.6-kW prototype circuit designed for electric vehicle onboard chargers. Experimental results of the hardware prototype show that the converter achieves a peak efficiency of 98.1% and high system efficiencies over wide output voltage and power ranges.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Zero voltage switching","Rectifiers","Inductance","Bridge circuits","Inductors","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

The dc distribution system is considered as a prospective system according to the increase of dc loads and dc output type distribution energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic (PV) systems and fuel cells. Since the dc distribution system has many advantages such as feasible connection of DERs and electric vehicles (EVs), reduction of conversion losses between dc output sources and loads, no reactive power issues, it is very suitable for industrial and commercial buildings interfaced with DERs and EVs. The establishment of an appropriate EMS based on the economic point of view can reduce energy costs of buildings and provide benefits to participants in energy management. Applicable elements for the dc distribution system are identified and the real-time decision-making-based algorithm for minimizing operating costs is proposed in this paper. The EV service model for the EMS to offer incentive to EV owners who participate in battery discharging is described. To verify the performances of the proposed algorithm, computer simulation and economic analysis are being performed where the results show that the proposed EMS reduces energy costs, motivates EV owners, and can be applied to the dc distribution buildings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6265409/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2012","volume":"28","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Management Strategy of the DC Distribution System in Buildings Using the EV Service Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Management Strategy of the DC Distribution System in Buildings Using the EV Service Model","sourcePdf":"tpel-jang-2210911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06848S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6341145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6341145","articleId":"6265409","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6265410,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-Myung Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6361328/6265410/6265410-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shin-Myung Jung (S'08) was born in Korea, in 1981.

Applying dirty paper coding (DPC) at the BS and linear processing at the RS, our aim is to find the input covariance matrices and the RS beamforming matrix that maximize the system sum-rate. To solve this non-convex problem, a more tractable dual multiple access relay channel (MARC) is investigated and an alternating-minimization algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, the mapping from the resulting covariance matrices for the MARC to the covariance matrices for the BRC is derived. Unlike other existing single-antenna-user schemes, our solution is applicable to a more general network with any number of antennas at the users. Compared with two such single-antenna-user schemes, simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the all-pass relay design and performs similarly to the SVD-relay design. Moreover, the proposed design performs close to the sum-rate upper bound with the performance gap decreasing with increasing number of antennas per user. It is also observed that having more antennas at the RS than at the BS is desirable for better system performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6357313/06265416.pdf","startPage":"6641","endPage":"6654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2212890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2212890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming in Non-Regenerative MIMO Broadcast Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Covariance matrix","Antennas","Array signal processing","Mobile communication","IEEE 802.16 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel coding","concave programming","covariance matrices","diversity reception","MIMO communication","minimisation","multifrequency antennas","radio broadcasting","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonregenerative MIMO","broadcast relay channel","multiple input multiple output","antenna base station","antenna relay station","dirty paper coding","DPC","BS","linear processing","covariance matrix","RS beamforming matrix","nonconvex problem","multiple access relay channel","MARC","alternating minimization algorithm","BRC","antenna user scheme","all-pass relay design","SVD relay design","sum rate maximization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","broadcast relay channel (BRC)","multiple access relay channel (MARC)","multiuser-MIMO relaying","sum-rate maximization","uplink-downlink duality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming in Non-Regenerative MIMO Broadcast Relay Networks","volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6265416/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136694","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming in Non-Regenerative MIMO Broadcast Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-krzymien-2212890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110472S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6357313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6357313","articleId":"6265416","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6265417,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Meignen","affiliation":["IDCOM Laboratory, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6327753/6265417/6265417-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sylvain Meignen received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics in 2001, and the \u201cHabilitation Diriger des Recherches\u201d in 2011, both from the University of Grenoble, France.","Since 2002, he has been an Assistant Professor with Grenoble INP.

In addition, for sequential HCL, we present a test routine generation technique on the basis of an extended finite state machine, so that structural patterns for combinational subcircuits in the sequential HCL can be mapped into the test routines to form a test program. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ATIG method can achieve good structural fault coverage with compact test programs on modern processors.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2208130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6545337/06265421.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2208130","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Test Program Generation Using Executing-Trace-Based Constraint Extraction for Embedded Processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Test Program Generation Using Executing-Trace-Based Constraint Extraction for Embedded Processors","volume":"21","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"13583408","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6265421/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Test Program Generation Using Executing-Trace-Based Constraint Extraction for Embedded Processors","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-li-2208130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122886S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6545337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6545337","articleId":"6265421","onlineDate":"10 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":6265422,"authors":[{"name":"Nessrine Chakchouk","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6353156/6265422/6265422-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nessrine Chakchouk (S'10) received the National Engineer Diploma in telecommunications and the M.S. degree with focus on networking from the Higher School of Communications of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia, in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

It turns out that, as far as output regulation goes, the recent form fits better some assumptions that have already been used in the context of square invertible systems and, more important, that can still be used (thanks to this particular normal form) in the context of not square ones.","doi":"10.1109/MED.2012.6265769","publicationTitle":"2012 20th Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation (MED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 20th Mediterranean Conference on Control & Automation (MED)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255874/6265599/06265769.pdf","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MED.2012.6265769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6265599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Necessary conditions for solving the nonlinear MIMO output regulation problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265769/","displayDocTitle":"Necessary conditions for solving the nonlinear MIMO output regulation problem","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12933893","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6265769/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Necessary conditions for solving the nonlinear MIMO output regulation problem","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"0168ThC102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040534S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255874","isNumber":"6265599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255874","xplore-issue":"6265599","articleId":"6265769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6265790,"authors":[{"name":"Sonia Maalej","affiliation":["LAGIS (Laboratoire dAutomatique, G\u00e9nie Informatique et Signal, CNRS UMR 8219), Ecole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Maalej","id":"38468168200"},{"name":"Christophe Fiter","affiliation":["LAGIS (Laboratoire dAutomatique, G\u00e9nie Informatique et Signal, CNRS UMR 8219), Ecole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Fiter","id":"38468035700"},{"name":"Laurentiu Hetel","affiliation":["LAGIS (Laboratoire dAutomatique, G\u00e9nie Informatique et Signal, CNRS UMR 8219), Ecole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Laurentiu","lastName":"Hetel","id":"37398910000"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Richard","affiliation":["LAGIS (Laboratoire dAutomatique, G\u00e9nie Informatique et Signal, CNRS UMR 8219), Ecole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Richard","id":"37290268300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2531-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2530-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2529-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6265790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265790","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","Lyapunov methods","Real time systems","Stability analysis","Switches","Dynamic scheduling","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","dynamic scheduling","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","Lyapunov methods","sampling methods","stability","state feedback","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-dependent sampling","linear time invariant systems","discrete time analysis","LTI systems","state feedback control","sampling rate","stabilizing sequences","sampling instants","dynamic scheduling algorithm","sampling sequence","Lyapunov functions","LMI optimization","Matlab","True Time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded Systems","Switching Systems","Sampling-Data Systems","Real-Time Control","Scheduling","Stability","Hybrid Dynamic Systems","Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI)"]}],"abstract":"This work concerns the adaptation of sampling times for Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems controlled by state feedback.

Different from existing works on force estimation where the complicated hysteresis behavior is modeled, a more effective method is presented to estimate the hysteresis effect by resorting to a perturbation estimation technique. Based upon the identified linear model of the system plant and the hysteresis estimator, the force applied to the microgripper arm is estimated by using a force estimator. The force estimator is developed by adopting a displacement sensor only, whereas the use of force sensor is eliminated in the force detection. The proposed approach is more computational effective than the existing methods based on hysteresis models.

In doing so, however, the contact force may experience overshoot which could damage the workpiece. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear damping control scheme which can reduce the force overshoot without compromising on the reaction speed. The controller design and the tuning of its parameters are relatively straightforward because the parameters possess clear physical meanings. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Damping","Robots","Closed loop systems","Actuators","Equations","Force control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","damping","force control","industrial robots","manipulators","mechanical contact","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved transient performance","robotics force control","robotic manipulator","contact force","nonlinear damping control scheme","force overshoot reduce","controller design","parameters tuning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AIM.2012.6265888","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257544/6265869/06265888.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6265869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2012.6265888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear damping for improved transient performance in robotics force control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear damping for improved transient performance in robotics force control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265888/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6265888/","accessionNumber":"12934207","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear damping for improved transient performance in robotics force control","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"AIM120031FI.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063194S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257544","isNumber":"6265869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257544","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6265869","articleId":"6265888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6265889,"authors":[{"name":"Andreea Radulescu","affiliation":["Institute of Perception Action and Behaviour, University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Andreea","lastName":"Radulescu","id":"37086004070"},{"name":"Matthew Howard","affiliation":["Institute of Perception Action and Behaviour, University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Howard","id":"37301483600"},{"name":"David J.

Based on the proposed image features and other 4 commonly used image moments, the interaction matrix relating the chosen image features to camera motion is derived to have maximal decoupled structure. In addition, the analytical form of depth computation is given by using classical geometrical primitives and image moment invariant. A proportional IBVS controller is designed based on the derived interaction matrix and the tracking performance is thus enhanced for the 6 degree-of-freedom robotic system.

In this work, a real-time FPGA-based template matching module which accelerates time consuming normalized cross-correlation (NCC) template matching was presented. To improve NCC computation speed, we simplified the original NCC algorithm and designed a pipelined parallel processing circuit architecture. Experimental results showed that our FPGA module accelerates NCC speed up to 80 times faster than PC performance.

However, the walking control that does not depend on ZMP is vulnerable to turnover. Therefore, keeping the event-driven walking of dynamical motion stable is important issue for realization of human-like natural walking. In this paper, walking model of humanoid including slipping, bumping, surface-contacting and point-contacting of foot is discussed, and its dynamical equation is derived by Newton-Euler method. Then, we propose walking stabilizer named \u201cVisual Lifting Stabilization\u201d strategy to enhance standing robustness and prevent the robot from falling down. Simulation results indicate that this strategy helps stabilize pose and bipedal walking even though ZMP is not kept inside convex hull of supporting area.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265962","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257544/6265869/06265962.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6265869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2012.6265962","startPage":"7","endPage":"14","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2012.6265962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dynamical analyses of humanoid's walking by visual lifting stabilization based on event-driven state transition","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6265962/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12934279","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical analyses of humanoid's walking by visual lifting stabilization based on event-driven state transition","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"AIM120139FI.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085673S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257544","isNumber":"6265869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257544","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6265869","articleId":"6265962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6265963,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Tomono","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Tomono","id":"38021240700"},{"name":"Yuya Itou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuya","lastName":"Itou","id":"38234358600"},{"name":"Mamoru Minami","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamoru","lastName":"Minami","id":"37280393200"},{"name":"Akira Yanou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Yanou","id":"37277313200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2576-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2575-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2574-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6247"}],"articleNumber":"6265963","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6265963","abstract":"Continuous catching and releasing experiment of several fishes make the fishes find some escaping strategies.

In comparison with some methods, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been shown to be more advantageous and is currently used in fault diagnosis system. For example, it hasn't any problem of conflict of new rules, which is a big problem in Expert System while adding new fault. In this work, ANN is improved. Its speed of learning and the iteration times can be self-corrected or mutated. Moreover, neural network can be combined with other optimization methods, like genetic methods, to achieve a better performance. Furthermore, according to the different types of sensors, certain sub-networks are built to assist the principal network or replace it in some anomaly condition. A decision system treats the results of all the networks and comes to a conclusion, which will be sent to pilot, airport command center (ACC), or fault tolerant system.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2012.6265975","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1128","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257544/6265869/06265975.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2012.6265975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6265869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aircraft fault diagnosis and decision system based on improved artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Artificial neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Sensor systems","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace expert systems","condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","fault tolerance","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft fault diagnosis","aircraft decision system","artificial neural networks","data-driven methods","fault detection and isolation","condition monitoring","ANN","expert system","learning","iteration times","optimization methods","genetic methods","sensors","anomaly condition","airport command center","ACC","fault tolerant system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6265975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Aircraft fault diagnosis and decision system based on improved artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6265975/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12934292","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aircraft fault diagnosis and decision system based on improved artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"AIM120161FI.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05978S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257544","isNumber":"6265869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257544","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6265869","articleId":"6265975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6265983,"authors":[{"name":"Rahib H.

Aiming for generating the dynamic locomotion of the robot, the design is based on the motion of a spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) and then expanded to the hexapod morphology. The required speed variations and phase offsets of legs are achieved by utilization of non-circular gear pairs in the transmission system. Thus, the robot can be driven by a single DC motor without control effort. The designed alternating tripod gait allows the robot to adequately negotiate with rough terrain as well as to excite dynamic running behavior.

When OFDM operates in the time division duplex (TDD) style, a guard interval is usually inserted so as to prevent the system from inter-symbol interference. Here, the length of the guard interval is nominally determined by observing the maximum delay spread. Due to the usage of the wireless repeater, the outage in this shadowed region can be avoide, and the service range can be extended. However, the problem to be resolved is shortening the processing time for relaying the data from the base station to the terminal or vice versa. Otherwise, the uplink and downlink slot can overlap either at the base station or the terminal, resulting in major performance degradation. Therefore, the primary concern in the realization of the wireless repeater is how to effectively reduce the processing time needed for down- and up-conversion of the signal to be relayed. With the TDD system, strict requirements relating to processing delay must be taken into account to avoid interference. This kind of interference results in outage because it causes the deterioration of signal quality. The primary concern is how to diminish the processing delay intrinsically occurring at the repeater so that the TDD system works properly. The conventional down and up-conversion processes are usually deployable to the repeater systems; these consist of multiple decimation/interpolation filters which cause delays. To reduce the delay without any major degradation in signal quality, IIR filter could be used instead of FIR filter. For the stable IIR filter, the filter design method using the balanced reduction scheme (BRS) introduced not only sustains the stability, but also reveals good approximation in the magnitude as well as the linear-like phase responses associated with a prototype FIR filter. Due to the inherently large amount of group delay representing system delay, it is not suitable for the low-latency repeater focused on in this paper. We adopted composed of concatenating IIR filter and allpass filter (CIAF) to each branch filter of polyphase filter (PF). The magnitude response of each branch fi Iter of PF may be identical to that resulting from the original branch filter. In our approach, the constraint on the design of each IIR filter in CIAF lies whether the stability is guaranteed. To accomplish this, referring to [5], the design of a minimum-phase IIR filter is utilized. This feature is quite preferable in the sense of minimizing overall processing delay for our applications. In order to resolve phase distortion from the nonlinearity of the phase response of magnitude response shaping filter, phase response equalization filter (PREF) is a filter used for making the overall phase response nearly linear. To achieve PREF, we employed an all-pass filter whose coefficients are updated by the complex least mean squares algorithm. The performances of the proposed method had been compared with the system requirements according to KT's Wibro repeater development specifications and BRS. According to performance results, the system delay of proposed method overwhelms one of the BRS. Even though error vector magnitude (EVM) and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of proposed method are inferior to those of BRS, they might be suitable because the corresponding EVM and ACLR obey the requirements. In conclusion, our proposed method is quite appropriate for delay-sensitive repeaters and can be applicable to any system required to have low-latency.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266073","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266073.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-latency polyphase filter scheme based on the IIR filter for the OFDM repeater","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266073/","displayDocTitle":"Low-latency polyphase filter scheme based on the IIR filter for the OFDM repeater","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12933976","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266073/","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-latency polyphase filter scheme based on the IIR filter for the OFDM repeater","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"111111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036095S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6266074,"authors":[{"name":"Heon Huh","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Korea Polytechnic University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heon","lastName":"Huh","id":"37551492400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0580-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0579-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0578-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"6266074","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood frame synchronization","OFDM systems","maximum likelihood frame synchronizer","maximum a posteriori probability estimation"]}],"abstract":"We present a maximum likelihood (ML) frame synchronizer for OFDM systems.

Arriving calls are granted service based on specific service class, required maximum and minimum bandwidth, and available network resources. Performance of priority-based dynamic capacity allocation, suitable for the wireless system supporting ATM-like traffic is analysed. Scheduling of the ATM cell transmission in each uplink TDMA frame is based on a priority scheme. GoS (blocking probability) and QoS (throughput) parameters for bandwidth sharing policy (BSP) are considered, and partial overlapped transmission link (POL) is implemented. In the modelling, the clustering procedure is developed based on Markov reward models (MRM), enhanced by the self-organizing vector quantification (VQ) and neural modelling. The optimal link occupancy probability distribution is calculated using the neural network, trained with Kohonen rules. Simulation and numerical results are shown. The efficiency of the link occupancy probability density function, applied for the network performance analysis, is confirmed by obtained numerical results. The approach proved to be useful and practical, allowing the simulations to be performed faster, easier, and less costly in resources. Although in this work we analyse performance of priority-based dynamic capacity allocation, suitable for the wireless network carrying ATM traffic, the results can be easily extended to ATM-like traffic, i.e. traffic of a similar nature and with comparable GoS/QoS parameters.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266075","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266075.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266075","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of emulated dynamic multi-service UMTS core networks using clustering and neural modelling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of emulated dynamic multi-service UMTS core networks using clustering and neural modelling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266075/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266075/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12933978","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of emulated dynamic multi-service UMTS core networks using clustering and neural modelling","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569530807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045947S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6266084,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Ide","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Ide","id":"38227814700"},{"name":"Bjoern Dusza","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Bjoern","lastName":"Dusza","id":"37595101800"},{"name":"Markus Putzke","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Putzke","id":"37596561400"},{"name":"Christian M\u00fcller","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"37586503900"},{"name":"Christian Wietfeld","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wietfeld","id":"37353607200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0580-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0579-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0578-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"6266084","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":873},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266084","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Analytical models","Ray tracing","Buildings","Laboratories","Downlink","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","Markov processes","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M2M communication","LTE physical resource utilization","machine-to-machine application","cellular communication systems","maximum system capacity","human-to-human communication","H2H communication","cellular networks","Long Term Evolution","quality of service","QoS constraint","Markovian model","laboratory measurement","ray tracing simulation","traffic characteristics","blocking probability","LTE cell"]}],"abstract":"The number of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications is rapidly increasing in cellular communication systems.

However, neither carrying out frequency domain equalization first nor despreading first can combine each diversity branch and fully exploit the frequency diversity.

Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that for single carrier block transmission systems with DSSS and the proposed LMMSE frequency domain equalization structure, full diversity gain can be obtained and the BER performance is obviously improved.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266088","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266088.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Spread spectrum communication","Diversity methods","Receivers","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","equalisers","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","least mean squares methods","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMMSE frequency-domain equalizer","single-carrier block transmission systems","DSSS","SC-FDE","frequency selective channels","single-antenna systems","direct sequence spread spectrum","time domain","frequency diversity","linear minimum mean square error receiver structure","LMMSE receiver structure","bit error rate","BER performance","full-diversity gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Full diversity achieving MMSE frequency-domain equalizer for single-carrier block transmission with DSSS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266088/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266088/","accessionNumber":"12933991","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full diversity achieving MMSE frequency-domain equalizer for single-carrier block transmission with DSSS","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569554749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055188S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6266090,"authors":[{"name":"Renato S.

In such solution, unlicensed secondary users (SUs) have the challenge of using the best spectrum's opportunities without interfering with the operation of licensed primary users (PUs). Hence, many researches have been carried out to maximize the CR throughput under the restriction of avoiding interference on PU network. However, most of these studies have considered that the transmission of SUs is not allowed within the sensed band during the sensing period. This consideration leads the CR to underutilize the available spectrum while sensing the radio frequency environment. Although current technologies don't allow for transmission and sensing at the same time, we prove in this paper that it is possible to sense and receive at the same time. We propose an extension for the traditional energy detection technique that allows the CR to sense the spectrum and decide about the PU presence even while other SUs are transmitting in the sensed spectrum band. Furthermore, we show that the proposed spectrum sensing model supports secondary-to-primary power ratio of about 31 dB for the IEEE 802.22 standard specifications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266090/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12933993","publicationDate":"April 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266090/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A spectrum sensing model for continuous transmission in cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spectrum sensing model for continuous transmission in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569555665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061012S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6266094,"authors":[{"name":"Huyen-Chi Bui","affiliation":["ISAE, DMIA, IRIT/ENSEEIHT, University of Toulouse III, France"],"firstName":"Huyen-Chi","lastName":"Bui","id":"38468238600"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lacan","affiliation":["ISAE, DMIA, University of Toulouse III, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","lastName":"Lacan","id":"37284719800"},{"name":"Marie-Laure Boucheret","affiliation":["IRIT/ENSEEIHT, University of Toulouse III, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Laure","lastName":"Boucheret","id":"38491572500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0580-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0579-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0578-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"6266094","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":486},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Niobium","Decoding","Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Receivers","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","diversity reception","interference suppression","multi-access systems","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced multiple random access scheme","satellite communications","multislots coded ALOHA","multiple random access method","contention resolution diversity slotted Aloha","CRDSA mechanism","coded slotted ALOHA","interference cancellation process","MuSCA decoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce Multi-Slots Coded ALOHA (MuSCA) as a multiple random access method for satellite communications. This scheme can be considered as a generalization of the Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha (CRDSA) mechanism. Instead of transmitting replicas, this system replaces them by several parts of a single word of an error correcting code. It is also different from Coded Slotted ALOHA (CSA) because collided data are used in the iterative decoding of the frame. In MuSCA, the entity in charge of the decoding mechanism collects all bursts of the same user (including the interfered slots) before decoding and implements a successive interference cancellation process to remove successfully decoded signals. Simulations show that the achievable total normalized throughput is greater than 1.25 and 1.4 for a frame of 100 and 500 slots, resulting in a gain of 85% and 75% with respect to CRDSA and CSA respectively. This gain comes from the combination between diversity introduced by the random distribution of the data on the frames and MuSCA decoding algorithm, allows the system to transmit on average more than one packet per slot. This paper is a first analysis of the proposed scheme and opens several perspectives.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced multiple random access scheme for satellite communications","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266094","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266094.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced multiple random access scheme for satellite communications","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266094/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12933997","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced multiple random access scheme for satellite communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569556677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062486S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":6266095,"authors":[{"name":"Youssif Fawzi Sharkasi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Youssif Fawzi","lastName":"Sharkasi","id":"38468085100"},{"name":"Des McLernon","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Des","lastName":"McLernon","id":"37285107700"},{"name":"Mounir Ghogho","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Ghogho","id":"37284467100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0580-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0579-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0578-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"6266095","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Robustness","Phase noise","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","matched filters","phase noise","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust spectrum sensing","carrier frequency offset","phase noise","cognitive radio","spectrum detection performance","system impairments","CFO","PN","energy detector","block-coherent detector","BLCD","block suboptimal number","second-order matched filter-I","SOMF-I","second-order matched filter-II","SOMF-II","detection ability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we examine the spectrum detection performance of a matched filter (MF) in the presence of two system impairments: i.e., carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase noise (PN). The results show that in the presence of CFO, the performance of the MF may be inferior to an energy detector (ED). So we propose three spectrum sensing techniques that are robust to CFO and outperform the MF over a certain range of CFO values. These three approaches are: the block-coherent detector (BLCD) with a suboptimal number (N/2) of blocks; the second-order matched filter-I (SOMF-I); and the second-order matched filter-II (SOMF-II), which is a modified version of SOMF-I. We show that the SOMF-II structure has the best detection performance of these three methods (in the presence of CFO). Finally, we examine the impact of PN on the detection ability of MF and SOMF-I. We will show that while PN will have some effect on the MF performance it does not impair the operation of SOMF-I.","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266095","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266095.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266095","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust spectrum sensing in the presence of carrier frequency offset and phase noise for cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"Robust spectrum sensing in the presence of carrier frequency offset and phase noise for cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266095/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266095/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12933998","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust spectrum sensing in the presence of carrier frequency offset and phase noise for cognitive radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569557619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051189S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6266098,"authors":[{"name":"Massa Ndong","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communications Research Center, University of Electro-Communications, Japan"],"firstName":"Massa","lastName":"Ndong","id":"37704410100"},{"name":"Takeo Fujii","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communications Research Center, University of Electro-Communications, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37277000800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0580-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0579-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0578-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"6266098","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Integrated circuits","Bandwidth","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-tier interference mitigation","self organized-self optimized Femtocells","multitier wireless cellular networks","opportunistic cancellation","base station","HeNB","femtocell mobile user","interference avoidance","underlay network performance","organized-self optimized network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Macrocell","femtocell","two-tier networks","MMSE","Cross-tier interference mitigation","power control","SON"]}],"abstract":"Maximizing frequency reuse is of high interest to multi-tier wireless cellular networks.

In this paper we study the interference mitigation techniques in femtocell/macrocell networks and we propose a frequency reuse mechanism that leads to increased overall system performance. In particular, the mechanism aims to maximize throughput via a variety of combinations between inner cell radius and frequency allocation to the macrocell.

In the first case, the apparent considerable performance gains enabled by space division multiple access (SDMA) in downlink transmissions are often obtained without taking into account sounding and channel access induced overhead. In the second case, crosstalk interference (CTI) between stations served by the SDMA transmission is not always accounted for. Consequently, in order to take into account all the parameters and characteristics of these two transmission schemes, precise PHY+MAC modeling is needed. A realistic and fair comparison can thus be performed. The new approach presented in this paper is based on a multi-user simulation platform containing an all inclusive PHY layer combined with an elaborated MAC layer working in a symbiotic manner. In order to discriminate the characteristics of each transmission scheme, the SU/MU comparison is done for single antenna stations, channel inversion being used as the precoding scheme. In addition, the influence of CTI in SDMA transmissions is also studied so as to compare the real gains of MU-MIMO with the generally accepted gains.","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266132.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SU/MU-MIMO in IEEE 802.11ac: PHY+MAC performance comparison for single antenna stations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Throughput","Downlink","Multiaccess communication","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Wireless LAN","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","crosstalk","MIMO communication","precoding","space division multiple access","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SU-MU-MIMO systems","IEEE 802.11ac","PHY-MAC performance comparison","single-antenna stations","single-user multiple-input multiple-output systems","multiple-user MIMO systems","physical laler","medium access control layer","space division multiple access","downlink transmissions","channel access-induced overhead","crosstalk interference","SDMA transmission","PHY-MAC modeling","multiuser simulation platform","channel inversion","precoding scheme","CTI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel inversion","cross-layer simulator","crosstalk interference","IEEE 802.11ac","MU-MIMO","SDMA","SU-MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"SU/MU-MIMO in IEEE 802.11ac: PHY+MAC performance comparison for single antenna stations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266132/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12934034","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SU/MU-MIMO in IEEE 802.11ac: PHY+MAC performance comparison for single antenna stations","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569563239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071092S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6266134,"authors":[{"name":"Faisal Fayyaz Qureshi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Faisal Fayyaz","lastName":"Qureshi","id":"38468162900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0580-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0579-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0578-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"6266134","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":651},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266134","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Energy efficiency","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient cognitive radio MAC protocol","ad hoc networks","cognitive radio technology","spectrum efficiency","frequency band opportunistic access","adaptive aggregation technique","DSA-MAC protocol","EECR-MAC protocol","CREAM-MAC protocol","OC-MAC protocol","802.11b protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","multi-channel MAC","energy efficient CRN","adhoc networks","frame aggregation","backup channel"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266134","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266134.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient cognitive radio MAC protocol for adhoc networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio technology can improve spectrum efficiency by allowing secondary users to opportunistically access frequency bands. Although a number of approaches have been proposed for improving the performance of cognitive radio networks, little attention has been given to energy efficiency. In this paper we propose a novel energy efficient cognitive radio MAC protocol for cognitive radios. The protocol uses an adaptive aggregation technique, which aggregates higher layer packets to minimize the amount of overhead. We show through evaluation that the protocol saves 9% time and 11.544% energy as compared to DSA-MAC protocol, as benchmark. Finally, we show that our new proposed EECR-MAC saves energy in the network as compared to CREAM-MAC, OC-MAC and DSA-MAC protocols. Also, EECR-MAC achieves higher throughput as compared to 802.11b and DSA protocols while load increases as an additional benefit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266134/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12934036","publicationDate":"April 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266134/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient cognitive radio MAC protocol for adhoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient cognitive radio MAC protocol for adhoc networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569563405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083049S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6266138,"authors":[{"name":"Ala' Al Masoud","affiliation":["Network Deployment & Maintainance Department, Operations Directorate, Jawwal, Palestine"],"firstName":"Ala'","lastName":"Al Masoud","id":"37086793071"},{"name":"G.

In this paper uplink simulation analyses have been conducted to calculate cell average capacity considering and isolated uplink connection and also the neighbor environment cell load. Moreover symmetrical and unsymmetrical MIMO channel simulations have been provided for indoor services, where coverage and quality of service are considered better in average than outdoor scenario, to boost the capacity performance especially for certain packet services.

Therefore, an interest of operators is to prolong a time spent by users connected to the femtocells. However, the longer time in the femtocell can brings lower quality of service due to lower quality of communication channel. Hence, the operators should compensate the drop in quality to users. A way of prolongation of time in femtocells is to initiate handover to the femtocell as soon as possible and postpone handover from the femtocell. This paper analyzes impact of modified hysteresis on several handover decision strategies. For this purpose, the handover decision phase is adjusted to prolong the time spent by users in the femtocells. This way, macrocells can be offloaded. The time spent in femtocells is prolonged according to customers' willingness to tolerate worse quality of connection in exchange for lower cost of connection provided by the femtocell.","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266139.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handover with consideration of connection cost in femtocell networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Moon","Ultrafast optics","Quality of service","Approximation algorithms","Interference","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["connection cost consideration","femtocell networks","offload macrocells","quality of service","communication channel quality","time prolongation","handover decision strategy","connection quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["femtocell","handover","hysteresis","connection cost","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"Handover with consideration of connection cost in femtocell networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266139/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12934041","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handover with consideration of connection cost in femtocell networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569563687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070014S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6266140,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37986473300"},{"name":"Ka-Lok Man","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Ka-Lok","lastName":"Man","id":"37410522900"},{"name":"Leming Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Leming","lastName":"Sun","id":"38468200300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0580-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0579-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0578-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-5070"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-5070"}],"articleNumber":"6266140","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"abstract":"High Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and high sidelobes are inherent problems of an OFDM signal.

This paper proposes optimum Selective Mapping (SLM) for a joint PAPR and sidelobe power reduction, in which candidate phase sequences are constructed in a parametric phasing scheme to provide independent alternative time signals as well as independent alternative frequency sidelobes. Maximum reductions are obtained for both sidelobe and PAPR for respective number of candidates. Despite a large number of candidate phase sequences are employed, computational efficiency can be achieved using a serial search optimization process with the partial-IFFT algorithm. The parametric phasing shared for both PAPR and sidelobe power reduction allows the side information to be embedded in all transmission symbols, hence either maximum likelihood detection (MLD) or pilot assisted detection (PAD) can be used for reception.","displayPublicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6253057/6266066/06266140.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012","doi":"10.1109/WTS.2012.6266140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WTS.2012.6266140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint PAPR and sidelobe power reduction using optimum SLM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Optimization","Joints","Receivers","Time frequency analysis","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","inverse transforms","maximum likelihood detection","OFDM modulation","optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint PAPR-sidelobe power reduction","optimum SLM","peak-to-average power ratio","OFDM signal","optimum selective mapping","phase sequence","parametric phasing scheme","time signals","frequency sidelobes","serial search optimization process","partial-IFFT algorithm","transmission symbols","maximum likelihood detection","pilot-assisted detection","MLD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PAPR","Sidelobe Suppression","SLM optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint PAPR and sidelobe power reduction using optimum SLM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266140/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12934042","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint PAPR and sidelobe power reduction using optimum SLM","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1569563901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117878S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6253057","isNumber":"6266066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6253057","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6266066","articleId":"6266140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6266232,"authors":[{"name":"Ruohan Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Ruohan","lastName":"Qian","id":"38468625700"},{"name":"Weihai Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Weihai","lastName":"Li","id":"37558032300"},{"name":"Nenghai Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Nenghai","lastName":"Yu","id":"37394112700"},{"name":"Zhuo Hao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Hao","id":"37591642100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2027-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4729-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6266232","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Forensics","Forgery","Accuracy","Interpolation","Cameras","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image forensics","social networking sites","image editing software","rotation-tolerant resampling detection method","blind image forgery detection algorithm","rate-distances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image forensics","resampling detection","rotation tolerant","spectrum analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266232","abstract":"Millions of photos are uploaded to social networking sites every day.

Experimental results on typical surveillance test sequences showed that CLHMM outperforms LHMM in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICMEW.2012.37","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265868/6266221/06266251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEW.2012.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266221","startPage":"175","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layered Hidden Markov Modeling for Surveillance Event Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layered Hidden Markov Modeling for Surveillance Event Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266251/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12935870","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6266251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layered Hidden Markov Modeling for Surveillance Event Recognition","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4729a175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065259S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265868","isNumber":"6266221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265868","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6266221","articleId":"6266251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6266273,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Fan","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Fan","id":"37552586500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2027-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4729-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6266273","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266273","abstract":"Photo collages are an effective form of visual communication and sharing. This paper is devoted to a particular style of photo layout, in which photos are tightly packed into a rectangular canvas while the aspect ratio and orientation of photos are preserved. In addition, users may specify a desired size for each photo within the canvas. BRIC (block recursive image composition) is a method that has been proposed for this problem [1]. In this paper, we present a better method based on the framework of genetic algorithm. Our method builds on three key components. First, we developed a fast method for computing the photo dimensions for a given layout tree. This makes it feasible to evaluate a large number of layout trees within a time limit that is acceptable for interactive multimedia applications. Second, we adapted a fitness measure that takes into account both the photo coverage of the canvas area and the size distribution of photos. Finally, we constructed appropriate genetic operators and incorporated the aforementioned evaluation method and fitness measure. Our experimental results showed that the proposed method is consistently better than BRIC.","doi":"10.1109/ICMEW.2012.59","startPage":"308","endPage":"313","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265868/6266221/06266273.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEW.2012.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photo Layout with a Fast Evaluation Method and Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Vegetation","Genetic algorithms","Cost function","Genetics","Complexity theory","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image processing","photography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photo layout","evaluation method","genetic algorithm","photo collage","visual communication","visual sharing","photo orientation","BRIC","block recursive image composition","photo dimension","layout tree","time limit","interactive multimedia application","fitness measure","photo coverage","canvas area","photo size distribution","genetic operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photo layout","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Photo Layout with a Fast Evaluation Method and Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266273/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12935892","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photo Layout with a Fast Evaluation Method and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4729a308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052583S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265868","isNumber":"6266221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265868","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6266221","articleId":"6266273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6266276,"authors":[{"name":"Yousuf Baig","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Yousuf","lastName":"Baig","id":"37973825800"},{"name":"Edmund M.K.

However, previously proposed CS based video codec either require a conventional video codec or a feedback channel for effective operation, thus increasing the complexity. In this paper, a distributed Compressed Video Sensing codec is proposed that only makes use of CS at the encoder. A novel Side Information generation scheme is incorporated in the decoder which exploits the correlation between CS measurements of nearby frames. It is much simpler than other schemes found in the literature and yet effective. Simulation results demonstrate that effective video coding can be achieved using this codec.","doi":"10.1109/ICMEW.2012.62","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265868/6266221/06266276.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEW.2012.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Video Coding Based on Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266276/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Video Coding Based on Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12935895","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266276/","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Video Coding Based on Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4729a325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068852S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265868","isNumber":"6266221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265868","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6266221","articleId":"6266276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6266313,"authors":[{"name":"Li Song","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Song","id":"37710558200"},{"name":"Xiabi Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiabi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292946700"},{"name":"Ling Ma","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Ma","id":"38469447900"},{"name":"Chunwu Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Imaging Diagnosis, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Chunwu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38469609600"},{"name":"Xinming Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Imaging Diagnosis, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xinming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38469692600"},{"name":"Yanfeng Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Imaging Diagnosis, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yanfeng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38469427900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2051-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2049-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2050-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-7125"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-7125"}],"articleNumber":"6266313","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":353},"abstract":"This paper proposes an approach to recognize Common Imaging Signs of Lesions (CISLs) in lung CT images.

Thus, classifying a huge number of cells or quantifying markers from large sets of images by experts is a very time-consuming and poorly reproducible task. In order to overcome such limitations, we propose a supervised method for automatic cell classification. Our approach consists of two steps: the first one is an indexing stage based on specific bio-inspired features relying on the distribution of contrast information on segmented cells. The second one is a supervised learning stage that selects the prototypical samples best representing the cell categories. These prototypes are used in a leveraged k-NN framework to predict the class of unlabeled cells. In this paper we have tested our new learning algorithm on cellular images acquired for the analysis of pathologies. In order to evaluate the automatic classification performances, we tested our algorithm on the HEp2 Cells dataset of (Foggia et al, CBMS 2010). Results are very promising, showing classification precision larger than 96% on average, thus suggesting our method as a valuable decision-support tool in such cellular imaging applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biological cells classification using bio-inspired descriptor in a boosting k-NN framework","publicationTitle":"2012 25th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","doi":"10.1109/CBMS.2012.6266359","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 25th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255878/6266284/06266359.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS.2012.6266359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Biological cells classification using bio-inspired descriptor in a boosting k-NN framework","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266359/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12998162","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biological cells classification using bio-inspired descriptor in a boosting k-NN framework","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"paper069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058653S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255878","isNumber":"6266284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255878","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6266284","articleId":"6266359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6266401,"authors":[{"name":"Ra\u00fal Alonso-Calvo","affiliation":["DLSIIS & DIA, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid"],"firstName":"Ra\u00fal","lastName":"Alonso-Calvo","id":"38330487500"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Crespo","affiliation":["DLSIIS & DIA, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Crespo","id":"38332972000"},{"name":"Miguel Mu\u00f1oz-M\u00e1rmol","affiliation":["Biomedical Informatics Group, DLSIIS & DIA, Facultad de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Mu\u00f1oz-M\u00e1rmol"},{"name":"Monserrate Intriago","affiliation":["DLSIIS & DIA, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid"],"firstName":"Monserrate","lastName":"Intriago","id":"37086724364"},{"name":"Ana Jimenez-Castellanos","affiliation":["DLSIIS & DIA, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Jimenez-Castellanos","id":"38469364000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2051-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2049-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2050-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-7125"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-7125"}],"articleNumber":"6266401","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Prototypes","Biomedical imaging","Databases","Data structures","Information retrieval","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","content-based retrieval","image retrieval","medical computing","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing service","biomedical image collection management","large image collection storage","large image collection analysis","very-large images","balanced multiagent system","data processing","information retrieval","content-based image retrieval"]}],"abstract":"A huge quantity of biomedical images is generated every day. Building effective and agile systems for managing these collections has become an important and expensive issue for hospitals and institutions. In this paper we present a cloud computing service and its application for the storage and analysis of large image collections, specifically for very-large images. This Cloud Computing Service allows users to manage image collections in a relatively low-cost manner. The service is internally implemented by a balanced multiagent system. A novel aspect of the system is that one image could be divided in several, and those can then be stored and managed separately. This feature improves performance in data processing and information retrieval.","publicationTitle":"2012 25th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 25th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6255878/6266284/06266401.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cloud Computing Service for managing biomedical image collections","doi":"10.1109/CBMS.2012.6266401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS.2012.6266401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Cloud Computing Service for managing biomedical image collections","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12998204","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6266401/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cloud Computing Service for managing biomedical image collections","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"paper111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059682S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6255878","isNumber":"6266284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6255878","xplore-issue":"6266284","articleId":"6266401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6266425,"authors":[{"name":"Atif Alamri","affiliation":["Chair of Pervasive Mobile Computing, College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Atif","lastName":"Alamri","id":"37540566200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2027-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4729-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6266425","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266425","abstract":"There is a strong need to improve the transmission mechanism for eHealth management and multimedia services over a heterogeneous network. Both efficient mechanisms for patient health information access, and communication and delivery over various devices face challenges. Specifically, they include devices with computation and power supply limitations, and HDTV that has a high bandwidth requirement, but limited resources. Network resource limitations are mostly characterized by throughput variations, and delay or transmission errors. An adaptive bit rate of a video in multimedia health services comprise desirable key features that should be considered. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a cloud computing framework that uses scalable video coding. This has efficient video compression that relieves heterogeneous devices when they execute heavier multimedia applications, use database storage and when delivering mobile health services over limited bandwidth resources. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a significant improvement in a PSNR-Y gain, as compared to the existing scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Medical services","Multimedia communication","Streaming media","Medical diagnostic imaging","Static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","health care","high definition television","multimedia computing","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud-based e-health multimedia framework","heterogeneous network","transmission mechanism","e-health management","multimedia services","HDTV","cloud computing","scalable video coding","PSNR-Y gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","e-health","heterogeneous network","scalable video coding"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEW.2012.84","startPage":"447","endPage":"452","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265868/6266221/06266425.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICMEW.2012.84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud-Based E-Health Multimedia Framework for Heterogeneous Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cloud-Based E-Health Multimedia Framework for Heterogeneous Network","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12935917","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6266425/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-Based E-Health Multimedia Framework for Heterogeneous Network","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4729a447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057553S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265868","isNumber":"6266221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265868","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6266221","articleId":"6266425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6266443,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Santarcangelo","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Santarcangelo","id":"38234210600"},{"name":"Xiao-Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiao-Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279339900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2027-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4729-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6266443","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Animation","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Equations","Mathematical model","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer animation","hidden Markov models","image sequences","image texture","video signal processing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["textural based Hidden Markov model","animation genre discrimination","video database","statistically modeling","temporal texture attributes","video sequence","gray level cooccurrence matrices","HMM","feature vector dimension"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Classification","Indexing","Video Retrieval"]}],"abstract":"This paper develops a novel method to automatically categorize different animation genres in a video database made for children, this is the first such research done in animation genre categorization.

The implemented system runs in real-time on a Nokia N900 and demonstrates the feasibility of performing both automatic face and speaker recognition on a mobile phone. We evaluate this recognition system on a novel publicly-available mobile phone database and provide a well defined evaluation protocol. This database was captured almost exclusively using mobile phones and aims to improve research into deploying biometric techniques to mobile devices. We show, on this mobile phone database, that face and speaker recognition can be performed in a mobile environment and using score fusion can improve the performance by more than 25% in terms of error rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266494/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12935949","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266494/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bi-Modal Person Recognition on a Mobile Phone: Using Mobile Phone Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Modal Person Recognition on a Mobile Phone: Using Mobile Phone Data","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4729a635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077488S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265868","isNumber":"6266221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265868","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6266221","articleId":"6266494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":6266669,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Arora","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Manish Arora is a PhD student in computer science and engineering at the University of California, San Diego.

There is heavier integration of the CPU and GPU, including the GPU appearing on the same die, further decreasing barriers to the use of the GPU to offload the CPU. Much effort has been made to adapt GPU designs to anticipate this new partitioning of the computation space, including better programming models and more general processing units with support for control flow. However, researchers have placed little attention on the CPU and how it must adapt to this change. This article demonstrates that the coming era of CPU and GPU integration requires us to rethink the CPU's design and architecture.

The UWB spectrum is divided into subbands (flat fading), and all results are averaged within the 7-GHz bandwidth. Two situations are distinguished and studied separately: the line of sight (LOS), i.e., gallery free of machinery and the non-line-of-sight (NLOS), i.e., machinery obstruction. It is demonstrated that measured \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex></formula>\n-factors were higher than 1.2 dB and lower than 0.2 dB for LOS and NLOS, respectively. Moreover, the MIMO subchannels have maximum correlation coefficients of 0.69 and 0.65 for LOS and NLOS, respectively. Furthermore, path loss exponent is of \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\alpha = 1.42$</tex></formula>\n for LOS, however, for NLOS, it is about 3.19. Hence, results suggest that mining machinery presence leads to shadowing and scattering that affect both the received power and time dispersion parameters experienced by the link. Consequently, such presence should be considered when assessing the performance of underground mine gallery wireless systems. The values of these parameters can be used for MIMO\u2013UWB channel modeling.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6341101/06266695.pdf","startPage":"5390","endPage":"5399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2209859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2209859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Mining Machinery on MIMO\u2013UWB Radiowave Propagation Within an Underground Gallery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Frequency measurement","Machinery","Antenna measurements","Bandwidth","Delay","Coherence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","multipath","propagation","underground mine gallery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Mining Machinery on MIMO\u2013UWB Radiowave Propagation Within an Underground Gallery","volume":"60","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6266695/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Mining Machinery on MIMO\u2013UWB Radiowave Propagation Within an Underground Gallery","sourcePdf":"tap-benmabrouk-2209859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138257S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6341101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6341101","articleId":"6266695","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6266697,"authors":[{"name":"Theng Huat Gan","affiliation":["DSO National Laboratories, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6365270/6266697/6266697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Theng Huat Gan (S'10) received the B.Eng.

Transmitarrays have been shown to be viable architectures, and two general design approaches have emerged: the layered-scatterer approach and the guided-wave approach. In this paper, we first investigate the beamforming capability of the layered-scatterer approach, generalizing the approach using impedance surfaces. Using Floquet mode analysis, we show that when a structure of this type is used to produce a pencil beam at angles greater than 20 degrees off-broadside, significant side-lobes are produced at large angles, regardless of the aperture size. Next, we present a fully reconfigurable 6 \u00d7 6 transmitarray based on a guided-wave approach that experimentally demonstrates both pencil beam scanning over a 100 \u00d7 100-degree window as well as shaped-beam synthesis, over a 10 percent fractional bandwidth. The conclusion from our investigations into these two approaches is that for general beamforming applications, the guided-wave approach is superior, achieving good bandwidth, scanning range, insertion loss, and small structure thickness, with only moderate fabrication complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Transmitarray Design Approaches for Beamforming Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2213054","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6365270/06266699.pdf","startPage":"5679","endPage":"5689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2213054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Transmitarray Design Approaches for Beamforming Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6266699/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13150494","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Transmitarray Design Approaches for Beamforming Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-hum-2213054-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069303S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6365270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6365270","articleId":"6266699","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6266702,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","Center for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6365270/6266702/6266702-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Li (S'08) was born in Heilongjiang province, China, in 1986.

In contrast, the same chassis excitation phenomenon complicates the design of multiple antennas for MIMO applications, since the same characteristic mode of the chassis may be effectively excited by more than one antenna, leading to strong mutual coupling and severe MIMO performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce a design concept for MIMO antennas to mitigate the chassis-induced mutual coupling, which is especially relevant for frequency bands below 1 GHz. We illustrate the design concept on a dual-antenna terminal at 0.93 GHz, where a folded monopole at one chassis edge excites the chassis' fundamental electric dipole mode and a coupled loop at the other chassis edge excites its own fundamental magnetic dipole mode. Since the two radiation modes are nearly orthogonal to each other, an isolation of over 30 dB is achieved. Moreover, we show that the antenna system can be conveniently modified for multiband operation, such as in the 900/1800/2600 MHz bands. Furthermore, by controlling the phase of the feed current on the folded monopole, the two antennas can be co-located on the same chassis edge with an isolation of over 20 dB. The co-located dual-antenna prototype was fabricated and verified in the measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2213056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6365270/06266702.pdf","startPage":"5947","endPage":"5957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2213056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupling of Multiple Antennas in Terminals With Chassis Excitation Using Polarization Diversity, Angle Diversity and Current Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266702/","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling of Multiple Antennas in Terminals With Chassis Excitation Using Polarization Diversity, Angle Diversity and Current Control","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13150496","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266702/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling of Multiple Antennas in Terminals With Chassis Excitation Using Polarization Diversity, Angle Diversity and Current Control","sourcePdf":"tap-li-2213056-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085436S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6365270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6365270","articleId":"6266702","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6266704,"authors":[{"name":"R.

By patterning the capacitive elements on a screen-printed barium-strontium-titanate (BST) thick-film ceramic, the resonant frequency of the FSS can be tuned. This technology offers a simple and cost effective way for integrating varactors into the FSS and is particularly attractive for microwave circuits with a high varactor density. A prototype is fabricated including two capacitive layers with an overall size of 40 mm \u00d7 40 mm. Each layer includes a total of 1600 integrated BST varactors that are fabricated by using a patterning and metallization process. A transmitted wave passing through the FSS will experience a phase shift, which can be tuned by tuning the passband. This allows steering the transmitted wave to a certain direction by applying a phase gradient along the FSS interface. A phase shift range of 360\u00b0 can be covered by cascading several FSS panels. The prototyped tunable FSS demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed technology and its potential for beam steering.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and

In this communication a compact ultra-wideband differential wide-slot antenna (DWSA) with the improved radiation pattern and gain is proposed. By truncating the corners of the ground plane, the current distribution in it becomes more ordered and the radiation performance of the proposed DWSA in the upper frequency band is effectively improved. Further, one strip line is loaded in the ground plane along the symmetric line in order to strengthen the virtual ground and reduce the influence of asymmetry factor brought by the processing error. The measured results show, the fabricated DWSA presents a -10 dB impedance bandwidth of 133.1% (from 2.49 to 12.41 GHz). Moreover, in the whole band, the antenna basically keeps the same radiation pattern and the gain is over 1.3 dBi. The measured results are in agreement with the simulated results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Wideband Differential Wide-Slot Antenna With Improved Radiation Patterns and Gain","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2213059","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6365270/06266707.pdf","startPage":"6013","endPage":"6018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2213059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Wideband Differential Wide-Slot Antenna With Improved Radiation Patterns and Gain","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6266707/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13150500","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Wideband Differential Wide-Slot Antenna With Improved Radiation Patterns and Gain","sourcePdf":"tap-zhang-2213059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048394S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6365270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6365270","articleId":"6266707","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6266709,"authors":[{"name":"Pim Nijssen","affiliation":["Games and AI Group, Department of Knowledge Engineering, Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University of Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4804728/6378413/6266709/6266709-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pim Nijssen received the M.

This game is essentially a two-player game in which the players are moving on a graph-based map. First, we discuss how determinization is applied to handle the imperfect information in the game. We show how using determinization in a single tree performs better than using separate trees for each determinization. We also propose a new technique, called location categorization, that biases the possible locations of the hider. The experimental results reveal that location categorization is a robust technique, and significantly increases the performance of the seekers. Next, we describe how to handle the coalition of the seekers by using coalition reduction. This technique balances each seeker's participation in the coalition. Coalition reduction improves the performance of the seekers significantly. Furthermore, we explain how domain knowledge is incorporated by applying \u03b5-greedy playouts and move filtering. Finally, we compare the MCTS players to minimax-based players, and we test the performance of our MCTS player against a commercial Scotland Yard program on the Nintendo DS. Based on the results, we may conclude that the MCTS-based hider and seekers play at a strong level.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804728/6378413/06266709.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2210424","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2210424","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266709","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Monte Carlo methods","Image edge detection","History","Computers","Artificial intelligence","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","Monte Carlo methods","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo tree search","hide-and-seek game","Scotland Yard","MCTS","two-player game","graph-based map","location categorization","coalition reduction","domain knowledge","\u03b5-greedy playouts","move filtering","Nintendo DS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperation in games","imperfect information","Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)","Scotland Yard"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266709/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo Tree Search for the Hide-and-Seek Game Scotland Yard","accessionNumber":"13172282","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6266709/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo Tree Search for the Hide-and-Seek Game Scotland Yard","sourcePdf":"tciaig-nijssen-2210424-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107688S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"6378413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6378413","articleId":"6266709","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6266710,"authors":[{"name":"Hussain A.

We also propose multiplexer-latches (MUX-Latches) that possess the logic function of combinational circuits and storing capacity of sequential circuits. Adopting the pipeline with MUX-FFs, which are composed of cascaded latches and MUX-Latches, many latch gates for sequencing can be removed. Analysis and simulation results show that an 8-to-1 serializer in the pipeline topology with MUX-FFs reduces 52% gate-count compared to that in the traditional pipeline topology. To verify the functions of the proposed design, two chips are implemented with the proposed 4-to-1 MUX-FF and 8-to-1 serializer with MUX-FFs in 90 nm CMOS technology. The measured results show that the MUX-FF and the proposed serializer with MUX-FFs are almost bit-error-free (with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BER</i>\n <; 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n ), operating at up to 6 Gbits/s and 12 Gbit/s, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6339093/06266712.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339093","startPage":"2600","endPage":"2610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Low Gate-Count Pipeline Topology With Multiplexer-Flip-Flops for Serial Link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Low Gate-Count Pipeline Topology With Multiplexer-Flip-Flops for Serial Link","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13100477","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6266712/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Low Gate-Count Pipeline Topology With Multiplexer-Flip-Flops for Serial Link","sourcePdf":"tcsi-tsai-2206494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130052S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6339093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6339093","articleId":"6266712","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6266713,"authors":[{"name":"Wonsik Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6486561/6266713/6266713-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wonsik Yu (S'12) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Ajou University, Suwon, Korea in 2010, and received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His current research interests include time-based analog-to-digital converter, time-to-digital converter, and digital RF receivers."]},"firstName":"Wonsik","lastName":"Yu","id":"38066427000"},{"name":"Jaewook Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6486561/6266713/6266713-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jaewook Kim (S'06) received the B.S., M.S., Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejon, Korea, in 2006, 2008 and 2011 respectively.","He is currently a post-doctoral associate in MIT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Cambridge, MA.

However, a quantitative assessment of the exact amount of storage required to meet a reliability target or guarantee in the presence of intermittent sources is not trivial. This paper describes a practical approach to achieving this. First, an analytical approach is developed for determining the amount of storage required to meet a reliability target at a specific load point. Then the method is extended to a more complex island-capable microgrid system where initial reliability assessment and final verification of reliability guarantee are performed using sequential Monte Carlo simulation. The necessary component and system models are developed and described, and a mock military base is used to demonstrate the method. The work reported was performed under a contract from Sandia National Laboratory to determine storage need in order to provide reliability guarantee on an island-capable military microgrid, but the approach applies as well to civilian systems, both islanded and grid-connected. A method for determining an optimal storage mix is also developed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266719/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266719/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13064144","volume":"27","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Determination of Storage Required to Meet Reliability Guarantees on Island-Capable Microgrids With Intermittent Sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of Storage Required to Meet Reliability Guarantees on Island-Capable Microgrids With Intermittent Sources","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-mitra-2203831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082264S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6334487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6334487","articleId":"6266719","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6266720,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Peng Yang (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2009 and M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 2011.

Time-of-use (TOU) pricing has been proposed as a demand-side management (DSM) method to influence user demands. In this paper, we describe a game-theoretic approach to optimize TOU pricing strategies (GT-TOU). We propose models of costs to utility companies arising from user demand fluctuations, and models of user satisfaction with the difference between the nominal demand and the actual consumption. We design utility functions for the company and the users, and obtain a Nash equilibrium using backward induction. In addition to a single-user-type scenario, we also consider a scenario with multiple types of users, each of whom responds differently to time-dependent prices. Numerical examples show that our method is effective in leveling the user demand by setting optimal TOU prices, potentially decreasing costs for the utility companies, and increasing user benefits. An increase in social welfare measure indicates improved market efficiency through TOU pricing.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2207134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06266720.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2207134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","startPage":"884","endPage":"892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A game-theoretic approach for optimal time-of-use electricity pricing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A game-theoretic approach for optimal time-of-use electricity pricing","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266720/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13934165","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6266720/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A game-theoretic approach for optimal time-of-use electricity pricing","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-nehorai-2207134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065735S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"262","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6266720","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6266721,"authors":[{"name":"Shengnan Shao","affiliation":["Virginia Tech\u2014Advanced Research Institute, Arlington, VA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shengnan Shao (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University (THU), Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

The DG penetration level could be limited by harmonic distortion because of the nonlinear current injected by inverter-based DG units and also protection coordination constraints because of the variation in fault current caused by synchronous-based DG units. Hence the objective of the proposed problem is to maximize DG penetration level from both types of DG units, taking into account power balance constraints, bus voltage limits, total and individual harmonic distortion limits specified by the IEEE-519 standard, over-current relay operating time limits, and protection coordination constraints. The DG penetration study is formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem and tested on the IEEE-30 bus looped distribution network with ten load and DG scenarios. Similarly, feasibility assessment of customer owned DG unit installations considering power quality and protection coordination is also studied. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can serve as an efficient planning tool for utility operators.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2209687","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1254","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06266723.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2209687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining Optimal Location and Size of Distributed Generation Resources Considering Harmonic and Protection Coordination Limits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Relays","Power system harmonics","Algorithms","Optimization","Harmonic distortion","Admittance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution networks","harmonic distortion","installation","invertors","nonlinear programming","overcurrent protection","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed generation resources","optimal location","optimal size","harmonic coordination limits","protection coordination limits","optimization problem","DG penetration level","harmonic distortion","nonlinear current","inverter-based DG units","fault current","synchronous-based DG units","power balance constraints","bus voltage limits","IEEE-519 standard","overcurrent relay","nonlinear programming","NLP","IEEE-30 bus","distribution network","DG unit installations","power quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed generation","harmonic distortion","harmonic power flow","particle swarm optimization","protection coordination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266723/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Determining Optimal Location and Size of Distributed Generation Resources Considering Harmonic and Protection Coordination Limits","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6266723/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13934121","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining Optimal Location and Size of Distributed Generation Resources Considering Harmonic and Protection Coordination Limits","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-veerappan-2209687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127162S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6266723","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":6266724,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Samadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6275510/6266724/6266724-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pedram Samadi (S'09) received the B.

In addition, smart pricing can be used to seek social benefits and to implement social objectives. To achieve social objectives, the utility company may need to collect various information about users and their energy consumption behavior, which can be challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing method to tackle this problem. We assume that each user is equipped with an energy consumption controller (ECC) as part of its smart meter. All smart meters are connected to not only the power grid but also a communication infrastructure. This allows two-way communication among smart meters and the utility company. We analytically model each user's preferences and energy consumption patterns in form of a utility function. Based on this model, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism which aims to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the aggregate utility functions of all users minus the total energy cost. Our design requires that each user provides some information about its energy demand. In return, the energy provider will determine each user's electricity bill payment. Finally, we verify some important properties of our proposed VCG mechanism for demand side management such as efficiency, user truthfulness, and nonnegative transfer. Simulation results confirm that the proposed pricing method can benefit both users and utility companies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Demand Side Management for the Future Smart Grid Using Mechanism Design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2203341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6275510/06266724.pdf","startPage":"1170","endPage":"1180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2203341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Demand Side Management for the Future Smart Grid Using Mechanism Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6266724/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933614","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Demand Side Management for the Future Smart Grid Using Mechanism Design","sourcePdf":"tsg-schober-2203341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076311S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6275510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"499","xplore-issue":"6275510","articleId":"6266724","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6266725,"authors":[{"name":"David Plans","affiliation":["School of Arts and New Media, University of Hull, Scarborough, North Yorkshire, UK"],"bio":{"p":["David Plans is a Lecturer in Music at the School of Arts and New Media, University of Hull, Scarborough, North Yorkshire, U.K. He has given papers and performances at the International Computer Music Conference, the European Conference on Artificial Life, the Darwin Symposium, and the Computer Arts Society in London.

In the signal injection sensorless control, however, the fundamental control performance is limited by the frequency of the injected signal, and no negligible acoustic noise is generated. If the frequency of the injected voltage signal would increase to pulsewidth modulation (PWM) switching frequency and if the switching frequency is near or above audible range, the dynamics of the sensorless control can be improved, and the acoustic noise can be remarkably reduced or totally eliminated. This paper describes how to extract the rotor position information of IPMSM using the voltage signal injection whose frequency is the same as the PWM switching frequency. Compared to the conventional heterodyning process, the proposed method is simple to implement and appropriate for PWM switching frequency signal injection.

The main procedure for the EKF implementation using FPGA/SoPC technique is decomposed into three parts: system requirements analysis, hardware design, and software design. The proposed architecture offers favorable flexibility since it supports the reconfigurable hardware and reprogramming software. For the sake of increasing the computational efficiency, the single precision floating-point customized instructions and algorithm optimization are adopted. A testing platform is introduced to evaluate the functionality and the computational performance of the EKF, which includes an FPGA prototyping board and an xPC-Target system. Simulation results of standard double lane change, slalom test, and hard accelerating and braking test show that the proposed EKF implementation scheme has acceptable precision and computational efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2208436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6512583/06266733.pdf","startPage":"3823","endPage":"3835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2208436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6512583","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of EKF for Vehicle Velocities Estimation on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266733/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of EKF for Vehicle Velocities Estimation on FPGA","volume":"60","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266733/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13484411","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of EKF for Vehicle Velocities Estimation on FPGA","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2208436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106917S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6512583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6512583","articleId":"6266733","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6266734,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6512583/6266734/6266734-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Cheng (M'10) received the B.E. degree in automation and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Lecturer with the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University.

In addition, the scheduling scheme should be performed in a distributed and energy-efficient way so that it can be conveniently implemented for a large-scale network. In this paper, for target tracking with multiple ultrasonic sensors, we convert the ISI avoidance problem to the problem of multiple access in a shared channel and adopt the time division multiple access strategy which has the properties of being collision free and energy efficient. Then, by graph theory, the scheduling problem is transformed into a coloring problem which aims at minimizing the number of used colors. Since the original problem has been proved to be NP-hard, we propose a distributed-saturation-degree-based algorithm (DSDA) which can be implemented locally by each node with information collected from its neighbors. Furthermore, we verify that an interference-free schedule is guaranteed to be obtained by DSDA. We derive analytical results for the complexity of this algorithm. Specifically, for different sensor network topologies, we prove that the expected converging time and the expected message transmissions per node are both upper bounded by \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\u03b4), where \u03b4 is the maximum neighborhood size in the network.

The proposed method is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that incorporates a glioma growth model for atlas seeding, a process which modifies the original atlas into one with tumor and edema adapted to best match a given set of patient's images. The modified atlas is registered into the patient space and utilized for estimating the posterior probabilities of various tissue labels. EM iteratively refines the estimates of the posterior probabilities of tissue labels, the deformation field and the tumor growth model parameters. Hence, in addition to segmentation, the proposed method results in atlas registration and a low-dimensional description of the patient scans through estimation of tumor model parameters. We validate the method by automatically segmenting 10 MR scans and comparing the results to those produced by clinical experts and two state-of-the-art methods. The resulting segmentations of tumor and edema outperform the results of the reference methods, and achieve a similar accuracy from a second human rater. We additionally apply the method to 122 patients scans and report the estimated tumor model parameters and their relations with segmentation and registration results. Based on the results from this patient population, we construct a statistical atlas of the glioma by inverting the estimated deformation fields to warp the tumor segmentations of patients scans into a common space.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6316007/06266750.pdf","startPage":"1941","endPage":"1954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2012.2210558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2012.2210558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6316007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GLISTR: Glioma Image Segmentation and Registration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tumors","Image segmentation","Brain modeling","Mathematical model","Equations","Probabilistic logic","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","image registration","image segmentation","medical image processing","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GLISTR approach","Glioma Image Segmentation and Registration","probabilistic atlas registration","brain magnetic resonance scan","tumor","healthy tissue","expectation maximization algorithm","edema","posterior probability","deformation field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diffusion-reaction model","expectation maximization (EM) algorithm","glioma atlas","joint segmentation-registration"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Algorithms","Brain Neoplasms","Databases, Factual","Glioma","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Middle Aged","Reproducibility of Results","Statistics, Nonparametric"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"GLISTR: Glioma Image Segmentation and Registration","volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6266750/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13030699","pubMedId":"22907965","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GLISTR: Glioma Image Segmentation and Registration","sourcePdf":"tmi-gooya-2210558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135306S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6316007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"6316007","articleId":"6266750","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6266752,"authors":[{"name":"Weiyi Feng","affiliation":["Virginia Tech, Center for Power Electronics Systems, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6341145/6266752/6266752-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiyi Feng (S\u201906) was born in China in 1983.

However, the normally ON nature counts as the main factor which keeps this device far from being considered as an alternative to the silicon insulated-gate bipolar transistor. A self-powered gate driver without external power supply for normally ON silicon carbide JFETs is presented in this paper. The proposed circuit is able to handle the short-circuit currents when the devices are subjected to the dc-link voltage by utilizing the energy associated with this current. On the other hand, it supplies the necessary negative gate-source voltage during the steady-state operation. A detailed description of the operating states in conjunction with a theoretical analysis of the proposed self-powered gate driver is presented. The first part of the experimental investigation has been performed when the proposed circuit is connected to a device which is directly subjected to the dc-link voltage. The second set of measurements were recorded when the self-powered gate-driver was employed as the driver of normally ON components in a half-bridge converter. From the experimental results, it is shown that the short-circuit current is cleared within approximately 20 \u03bcs after the dc-link voltage is applied, while the power consumption when all devices are kept in the OFF state equals 0.37 W. Moreover, it is experimentally shown that the proposed gate driver can properly switch when it is employed in a half-bridge converter. Finally, limitations regarding the range of the applications where the self-powered gate drive can efficiently operate are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2209185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6330009/06266753.pdf","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2209185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6330009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Powered Gate Driver for Normally ON Silicon Carbide Junction Field-Effect Transistors Without External Power Supply","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266753/","displayDocTitle":"Self-Powered Gate Driver for Normally ON Silicon Carbide Junction Field-Effect Transistors Without External Power Supply","volume":"28","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13038979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Powered Gate Driver for Normally ON Silicon Carbide Junction Field-Effect Transistors Without External Power Supply","sourcePdf":"tpel-peftitsis-2209185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056899S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6330009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"31","articleId":"6266753","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6266754,"authors":[{"name":"Shengqi Zhou","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6330009/6266754/6266754-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shengqi Zhou received the B.E degree in high voltage and insulation technology and the M.S. degree in power electronics and drives from the Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.

A method for detecting defects in the IGBT module by identifying dynamic changes of the gate current is presented in this paper. It is based on the fact that parasitic elements inside the IGBT module are affected by local damage induced by aging over time, and subsequently, these influences are easily distinguished by dynamic changes of the gate current. The proposed prognostic approach is based on relevance vector machine framework, which can give accurate predictions and allow operators to observe unhealthy IGBT modules inside a power converter, and then take appropriate measures timely to avoid breakdown. The parasitic elements involved in the gate circuit are extracted, and their contributions to dynamic changes of the gate current are also discussed. Finally, a confirmatory experiment is carried out, and the correctness of the proposed method is verified.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring Potential Defects in an IGBT Module Based on Dynamic Changes of the Gate Current","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2210249","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6330009/06266754.pdf","startPage":"1479","endPage":"1487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2210249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6330009","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring Potential Defects in an IGBT Module Based on Dynamic Changes of the Gate Current","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6266754/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2012","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13038980","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring Potential Defects in an IGBT Module Based on Dynamic Changes of the Gate Current","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhou-2210249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094549S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6330009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6330009","articleId":"6266754","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6266757,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Agamennoni","affiliation":["Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6299044/6266757/6266757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gabriel Agamennoni (M'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina.

Their ubiquity stems from their modeling flexibility, as well as the development of a battery of powerful algorithms for estimating the state variables. For multivariate models, the Gaussian noise assumption is predominant due its convenient computational properties. In some cases, anyhow, this assumption breaks down and no longer holds. We propose a novel approach to extending the applicability of this class of models to a wider range of noise distributions without losing the computational advantages of the associated algorithms. The estimation methods we develop parallel the Kalman filter and thus are readily implemented and inherit the same order of complexity. We derive all of the equations and algorithms from first principles. In order to validate the performance of our approach, we present specific instances of non-Gaussian state-space models and test their performance on experiments with synthetic and real data.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2208106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6299044/06266757.pdf","startPage":"5024","endPage":"5037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6299044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2208106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Inference in State-Space Models With Heavy-Tailed Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Inference in State-Space Models With Heavy-Tailed Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266757/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12982323","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266757/","volume":"60","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Inference in State-Space Models With Heavy-Tailed Noise","sourcePdf":"tsp-agamennoni-2208106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158698S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6299044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6299044","articleId":"6266757","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6266758,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9 L.

We show that a collection of second-order derivatives of the CGF of the observations can be stored in a third-order tensor following a constrained factor (CONFAC) decomposition with known constrained structure. In order to increase the diversity, we combine three derivative types into an extended third-order CONFAC decomposition. A detailed uniqueness study of this decomposition is provided, from which easy-to-check sufficient conditions ensuring the essential uniqueness of the mixing matrix are obtained. From an algorithmic viewpoint, we develop a CONFAC-based enhanced line search (CONFAC-ELS) method to be used with an alternating least squares estimation procedure for accelerated convergence, and also analyze the numerical complexities of two CONFAC-based algorithms (namely, CONFAC-ALS and CONFAC-ELS) in comparison with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)-based algorithm recently derived to solve the same problem.

Three on-body channels, i.e., the belt-head, belt-wrist, and belt-chest channels, are of interest when adopting either discrete- or continuous-rate schemes. First, the on-body channel is modeled using the joint correlation matrix by taking into account the different propagation mechanisms experienced by the spatial subchannels, then the performance in terms of the spectral efficiency of the simulated channel using the model is shown to be in good agreement with the measurements. Owing to the presence of a line-of-sight (LOS) component, the achievable spectral efficiency of the on-body channels is lower than that of the equivalent Rayleigh channel. Due to its low spatial subchannel correlation, the belt-head channel is shown to offer the best performance in terms of spectral efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and Bit Allocation in On-Body Channels Using MIMO Antenna Arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2212009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6410063/06266760.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2212009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Power and Bit Allocation in On-Body Channels Using MIMO Antenna Arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6266760/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219858","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and Bit Allocation in On-Body Channels Using MIMO Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tvt-ghanem-2212009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104469S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6410063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6410063","articleId":"6266760","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6266761,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Khaligh","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory, Institute for System Research and Electrical andComputer Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6330019/6266761/6266761-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Khaligh (S'04\u2013M'06\u2013SM'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Grainger Center for Electric Machinery and Electromechanics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The extent to which PEVs are adopted significantly depends on the nature of the charging solution utilized.

One challenge in this kind of hierarchical cognitive radio (HCR) systems is to manage the interference between the macrocell and the microcell. The key contribution of this paper is to develop an optimization technique for antenna beamforming that can maximize the achievable sum rate of the underlying cognitive radio (CR) microcellular system and control the interference between the macrocell and the microcell with a satisfaction level. The proposed technique optimizes the sum rate performance by maximizing its lower bound and transfers the original non-convex problem into a convex optimization problem by introducing auxiliary variables to confine the intra-user interference power among the secondary system. Next, an iterative sum rate maximization (ISM) algorithm is developed to find the beamforming weights and the allocated power for each secondary user to simultaneously maximize system sum rate, coverage, and concurrent multiuser transmission probability in the HCR system. The developed joint design methodology provides valuable insights into the design of an optimal HCR system for various numbers of users as well as cell coverage, and can quantitatively optimize the performance tradeoffs in the hierarchical multiuser CR systems for current and future wireless communication applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","volume":"60","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"13056948","publicationDate":"October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266763/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Toward Optimal Multiuser Antenna Beamforming for Hierarchical Cognitive Radio Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Optimal Multiuser Antenna Beamforming for Hierarchical Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"2872-tc1210-ku.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130167S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6331703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6331703","articleId":"6266763","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6266764,"authors":[{"name":"Thuy Van Nguyen","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6331703/6266764/6266764-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thuy van Nguyen (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electronics and telecommunications from Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1999 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from New Mexico State University in 2005.

Puncturing can be used to generate rate-compatible LDPC codes, but it produces a gap to capacity that, in practice, often significantly exceeds the gap of the mother code. We propose an alternative method based on successively extending a high-rate protograph.

The SWBP is easy to implement and performs well in simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.080212.110108A","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6362326/06266765.pdf","startPage":"3161","endPage":"3166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.080212.110108A","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC-Based Lossless Compression of Nonstationary Binary Sources Using Sliding-Window Belief Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266765/","displayDocTitle":"LDPC-Based Lossless Compression of Nonstationary Binary Sources Using Sliding-Window Belief Propagation","volume":"60","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148504","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266765/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC-Based Lossless Compression of Nonstationary Binary Sources Using Sliding-Window Belief Propagation","sourcePdf":"3161-tc1211-fang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038302S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6362326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6362326","articleId":"6266765","onlineDate":"13 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6266766,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Mashayekhi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI) and the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Mashayekhi","id":"38517648800"},{"name":"Farokh Marvasti","affiliation":["Honorary Senior Research Associate at the Electrical Engineering Department, University College London, London, UK","Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI) and the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farokh","lastName":"Marvasti","id":"37356612700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6266766","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Vectors","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Computational complexity","Support vector machine classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","communication complexity","maximum likelihood decoding","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniquely decodable code","fast decoder","signature matrices","overloaded synchronous CDMA system","complexity decoder","overloaded system","maximum likelihood implementation","ML decoder","computational complexity","probability","signal to noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coding","code division multiple access (CDMA)","overloaded codes","uniquely decodable codes","fast decoding","computational complexity","bit-error rate (BER)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new class of signature matrices for overloaded synchronous CDMA systems that have a very low complexity decoder.

An eavesdropper has the access to the global channel state information (CSI), and all the other nodes only know the CSI not associated with the eavesdropper. A new secrecy transmission protocol is proposed, where the concept of interference alignment is combined with cooperative jamming to ensure that artificial noise from transmitters can be aligned at the destination, but not at the eavesdropper due to the randomness of wireless channels. Analytical results, such as ergodic secrecy rate and outage probability, are developed, from which more insightful understanding of the proposed protocol, such as multiplexing and diversity gains, can be obtained. A few special cases, where outage probability cannot be decreased to zero regardless of SNR, are also discussed.

The derived protocols are characterized by the fact that physical layer network coding is employed at the relay, where each source has side information about the signals it has sent. Amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols are applied to the N-way relay network setting, where the achievable rate regions for those protocols are derived and compared with outer capacity bounds. We propose several practical space-time coding schemes for AF and DF, and introduce two new protocols denoted as denoise-and-forward (DNF) and estimate-and-forward (EF).

Moreover, many authorative publications have already treated the electronic and practical details as well as the historical background. Examples include fairly recent books by Walt Kester of Analog Devices [3] and Marcel Pelgrom of NXP, formerly Philips [4]; a 1978 tutorial article by Bernard Gordon [5]; and a textbook on pulse code modulation by K. W. Cattermole [6]. Gordon, who until recently was still active at Analogic Corp. and who in the 1950s pioneered analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for avionics and missile telemetry, noted in his 1978 paper that the overall field of data conversion has sprung from two distinct fountainheads. [One was in the] late 1930s [with the invention of] coding and decoding for pulse c<?Pub Caret?>ode modulation, primarily for telephone communication. Not until the early 1950s [did the second arrive:] instrumentation-oriented data conversion.

The experiments for simulation were done in SystemC-RTL which can achieve more flexibility and maintain the cycle accuracy.

The main idea behind them is to take a route that crosses over itself and reorder it so that it does not. It is a very important local search technique. GPU usage greatly decreases the time needed to find the best edges to be swapped in a route. Our results show that at least 90% of the time during Iterated Local Search is spent on the local search itself. We used 13 TSPLIB problem instances with sizes ranging from 100 to 4461 cities for testing. Our results show that by using our GPU algorithm, the time needed to find optimal swaps can be decreased approximately 3 to 26 times compared to parallel CPU code using 32 cores.

We are showing that re-computing data is usually faster than reading it from memory in case of multi-core systems and we are proposing this approach as a solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260982/6266874/06266963.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"495","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2012.6266963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2012.6266963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating 2-opt and 3-opt local search using GPU in the travelling salesman problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Cities and towns","Instruction sets","Approximation algorithms","Table lookup","Heuristic algorithms","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","search problems","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2-opt local search","3-opt local search","travelling salesman problem","high performance GPU","iterated local search","TSPLIB problem","parallel CPU code","parallel architecture","multicore systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating 2-opt and 3-opt local search using GPU in the travelling salesman problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266963/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12943806","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"2-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating 2-opt and 3-opt local search using GPU in the travelling salesman problem","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075082S","chronDate":"2-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260982","isNumber":"6266874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260982","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6266874","articleId":"6266963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6266966,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro J.

Those primitives are usually invoked from the host many times, so their throughput has a great impact on the performance of the overall system. Thus, the study of novel algorithmic strategies to optimize their implementation on current devices is an interesting topic to the GPU community. In this paper we focus on optimizing the reduction primitive, which merely reduces a data sequence into a single value using a binary associative operator. Although tree-based and sequential-based algorithms have been already implemented on GPUs, a comparison of both algorithm performance had not been carried out yet. Thus, our first contribution is to present an experimental study of state-of-the-art reduction algorithms on CUDA. Next we introduce two algorithmic optimizations that are integrated into the fastest solution (a sequential-based algorithm), improving its throughput even more. Finally, we replicate this methodology to the segmented version of the primitive, which applies when the input is composed of several independent segments. In this case, it is not clear which algorithm exhibits the best performance, since throughput deeply depends on the distribution of segments along the input. According to our results, tree-based algorithms run faster for small segments, while sequential methods are better for medium and large ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithmic strategies for optimizing the parallel reduction primitive in CUDA","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2012.6266966","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260982/6266874/06266966.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2012.6266966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6266874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6266966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6266966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Algorithmic strategies for optimizing the parallel reduction primitive in CUDA","conferenceDate":"2-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6266966/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12935700","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithmic strategies for optimizing the parallel reduction primitive in CUDA","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053362S","chronDate":"2-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260982","isNumber":"6266874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260982","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6266874","articleId":"6266966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6266987,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai Lungu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Energetic, and Avionics Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Lungu","id":"37886294000"},{"name":"Romulus Lungu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Energetic, and Avionics Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Romulus","lastName":"Lungu","id":"37890953500"},{"name":"Lucian Teodor Grigorie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Energetic, and Avionics Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian Teodor","lastName":"Grigorie","id":"37891968900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2362-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2359-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2361-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6266987","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Equations","Aircraft","Adaptive systems","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","aircraft control","control system synthesis","linear systems","MIMO systems","motion control","observers","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive observer","MIMO linear time-varying system design","SISO systems","single-input-single-output systems","multiinput-multioutput systems","LTV","aircraft longitudinal motion state estimation","aircraft lateral motion state estimation","Charlie aircraft","Boeing 747 airplane"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive observer","algorithm","aircraft","longitudinal motion","lateral motion"]}],"abstract":"Most important adaptive observers study the SISO (single-input-single-output) systems; the generalization of these algorithms for the case of MIMO (multi-input-multi-output) systems is difficult to be made.

With ENISI, immunologists and infectious disease experts can test and generate hypotheses for enteric disease pathology and propose interventions through experimental infection of an in silico gut. ENISI is an agent based simulator, in which individual cells move through the simulated tissues, and engage in context-dependent interactions with the other cells with which they are in contact. The scale of ENISI is unprecedented in this domain, with the ability to simulate 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup>\n cells for 250 simulated days on 576 cores in one and a half hours, with the potential to scale to even larger hardware and problem sizes. In this paper we describe the ENISI simulator for modeling mucosal immune responses to gastrointestinal pathogens. We then demonstrate the utility of ENISI by recreating an experimental infection of a mouse with Helicobacter pylori 26695. The results identify specific processes by which bacterial virulence factors do and do not contribute to pathogenesis associated with H. pylori strain 26695. These modeling results inform general intervention strategies by indicating immunomodulatory mechanisms such as those used in inflammatory bowel disease may be more appropriate therapeutically than directly targeting specific microbial populations through vaccination or by using antimicrobials.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267823.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.15","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","startPage":"48","endPage":"59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance Interaction-Based Simulation of Gut Immunopathologies with ENteric Immunity Simulator (ENISI)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Interaction-Based Simulation of Gut Immunopathologies with ENteric Immunity Simulator (ENISI)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267823/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6267823/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12935967","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Interaction-Based Simulation of Gut Immunopathologies with ENteric Immunity Simulator (ENISI)","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087347S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6267826,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Cui","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Cui","id":"38242831400"},{"name":"Yun Liang","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Liang","id":"38003339700"},{"name":"Kyle Rupnow","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kyle","lastName":"Rupnow","id":"37681257200"},{"name":"Deming Chen","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Deming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37274186500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4675-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6267826","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1201},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267826","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Graphics processing unit","Measurement","Kernel","Layout","Optimization","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading","operating system kernels","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control flow divergence optimization","graphics processing units","general-purpose parallel processing performance","streaming multiprocessors","single-instruction multiple-data execution style","SIMD execution style","data-parallel applications","resource utilization","code transformations","memory access indirection","input data reorganization","guiding metric","computation-bound GPU kernel performance estimation","value function","thread regrouping algorithms","NVIDIA GTS250 GPU","massively parallel architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPGPU","CUDA","performance metric","performance estimation","control flow divergence"]}],"abstract":"Graphics processing units (GPUs) are increasingly critical for general-purpose parallel processing performance. GPU hardware is composed of many streaming multiprocessors, each of which employs the single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) execution style. This massively parallel architecture allows GPUs to execute tens of thousands of threads in parallel. Thus, GPU architectures efficiently execute heavily data-parallel applications. However, due to this SIMD execution style, resource utilization and thus overall performance can be significantly affected if computation threads must take diverging control paths. Control flow divergence in GPUs is a well-known problem: prior approaches have attempted to reduce control flow divergence through code transformations, memory access indirection, and input data reorganization. However, as we will demonstrate, the utility of these transformations is seriously affected by the lack of a guiding metric that properly estimates how control flow divergence affects application performance. In this paper, we introduce a metric that simply and accurately estimates performance of computation-bound GPU kernels with control flow divergence, and use the metric as a value function for thread re-grouping algorithms. We measure the performance on NVIDIA GTS250 GPU. For the tested set of applications, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed metric correlates well with actual GPU application performance. Through thread re-grouping guided by our metric, control flow divergence optimization can improve application performance by up to 3.19X.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.18","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267826.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Accurate GPU Performance Model for Effective Control Flow Divergence Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Accurate GPU Performance Model for Effective Control Flow Divergence Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6267826/","accessionNumber":"12935970","publicationDate":"May 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Accurate GPU Performance Model for Effective Control Flow Divergence Optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08768S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6267838,"authors":[{"name":"Hagen Peters","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, CAU Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Hagen","lastName":"Peters","id":"37410067600"},{"name":"Ole Schulz-Hildebrandt","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, CAU Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Ole","lastName":"Schulz-Hildebrandt","id":"38275252000"},{"name":"Norbert Luttenberger","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, CAU Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Luttenberger","id":"37392902700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4675-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6267838","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":538},"abstract":"Adaptive bitonic sort is a well known merge-based parallel sorting algorithm. It achieves optimal complexity using a complex tree-like data structure called a bitonic tree. Due to this, using adaptive bitonic sort together with other algorithms usually implies converting bitonic trees to arrays and vice versa. This makes adaptive bitonic sort inappropriate in the context of hybrid sorting algorithms where frequent switches between algorithms are performed. In this article we present a novel optimal sorting algorithm that is based on an approach similar to adaptive bitonic sort. Our approach does not use bitonic trees but uses the input array together with some additional information. Using this approach it is trivial to switch between adaptive bitonic sort and other algorithms. We present an implementation of a hybrid algorithm for GPUs based on bitonic sort and our novel algorithm. This implementation turns out to be the fastest comparison-based sorting algorithm for GPUs found in literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267838.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Sorting Algorithm for Many-core Architectures Based on Adaptive Bitonic Sort","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Complexity theory","Vegetation","Arrays","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","graphics processing units","merging","multiprocessing systems","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","sorting","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["many-core architecture","adaptive bitonic sort","merge-based parallel sorting algorithm","optimal complexity","complex tree-like data structure","bitonic tree","hybrid sorting algorithms","GPU","comparison-based sorting algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sorting","parallel","many-core","CUDA","bitonic sort"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Sorting Algorithm for Many-core Architectures Based on Adaptive Bitonic Sort","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6267838/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12935982","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Sorting Algorithm for Many-core Architectures Based on Adaptive Bitonic Sort","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048366S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6267845,"authors":[{"name":"Andres Tomas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Tomas","id":"38468927800"},{"name":"Chia-Chen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chia-Chen","lastName":"Chang","id":"38469099900"},{"name":"Richard Scalettar","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Scalettar","id":"37321066900"},{"name":"Zhaojun Bai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhaojun","lastName":"Bai","id":"37394776000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4675-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6267845","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"abstract":"The Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method is one of the most powerful approaches for understanding properties of an important class of materials with strongly interacting electrons, including magnets and superconductors. It treats these interactions exactly, but the solution of a system of N electrons must be extrapolated to bulk values. Currently N 500 is state-of-the-art. Increasing N is required before DQMC can be used to model newly synthesized materials like functional multilayers. DQMC requires millions of linear algebra computations of order N matrices and scales as N3. DQMC cannot exploit parallel distributed memory computers efficiently due to limited scalability with the small matrix sizes and stringent procedures for numerical stability. Today, the combination of multisocket multicore processors and GPUs provides widely available platforms with new opportunities for DQMC parallelization. The kernel of DQMC, the calculation of the Green's function, involves long products of matrices. For numerical stability, these products must be computed using graded decompositions generated by the QR decomposition with column pivoting. The high communication overhead of pivoting limits parallel efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the progressive graded structure to reduce the communication costs of pivoting. We show that this method preserves the same numerical stability and achieves 70% performance of highly optimized DGEMM on a two-socket six-core Intel processor. We have integrated this new method and other parallelization techniques into QUEST, a modern DQMC simulation package. Using 36 hours on this Intel processor, we are able to compute accurately the magnetic properties and Fermi surface of a system of N = 1024 electrons. This simulation is almost an order of magnitude more difficult than N 500, owing to the N3 scaling. This increase in system size will allow, for the first time, the computation of the magnetic and transport properties of layered materials with DQMC. In addition, we show preliminary results which further accelerate DQMC simulations by using GPU processors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267845.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"319","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advancing Large Scale Many-Body QMC Simulations on GPU Accelerated Multicore Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Matrix decomposition","Multicore processing","Program processors","Materials","Lattices","Green products"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed memory systems","graphics processing units","Green's function methods","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large scale many-body QMC simulations","GPU","multicore systems","determinant quantum Monte Carlo method","DQMC method","magnets","superconductors","functional multilayers","linear algebra","parallel distributed memory computers","numerical stability","multisocket multicore processors","DQMC parallelization","Green function","QUEST","DQMC simulation package"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum Monte Carlo","QRP","multicore","GPU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Advancing Large Scale Many-Body QMC Simulations on GPU Accelerated Multicore Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6267845/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12935989","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advancing Large Scale Many-Body QMC Simulations on GPU Accelerated Multicore Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121567S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6267847,"authors":[{"name":"Xuechen Zhang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Xuechen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405064800"},{"name":"Kei Davis","affiliation":["CCS Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Davis","id":"37282656500"},{"name":"Song Jiang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279383900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4675-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6267847","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Servers","Processor scheduling","Electromagnetic compatibility","Process control","Throughput","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","input-output programs","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic data driven execution","parallel programs","efficient I/O services","parallel system","process scheduling","I/O scheduling","programs performance","normal computation driven mode","MPI programs","I/O service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Process Scheduling","I/O Request Scheduling","Prefetching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267847","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267847.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Data-driven Execution of Parallel Programs for Efficient I/O Services","abstract":"A parallel system relies on both process scheduling and I/O scheduling for efficient use of resources, and a program's performance hinges on the resource on which it is bottlenecked. Existing process schedulers and I/O schedulers are independent. However, when the bottleneck is I/O, there is an opportunity to alleviate it via cooperation between the I/O and process schedulers: the service efficiency of I/O requests can be highly dependent on their issuance order, which in turn is heavily influenced by process scheduling. We propose a data-driven program execution mode in which process scheduling and request issuance are coordinated to facilitate effective I/O scheduling for high disk efficiency. Our implementation, Dual Par, uses process suspension and resumption, as well as pre-execution and prefetching techniques, to provide a pool of pre-sorted requests to the I/O scheduler. This data-driven execution mode is enabled when I/O is detected to be the bottleneck, otherwise the program runs in the normal computation-driven mode. Dual Par is implemented in the MPICH2 MPI-IO library for MPI programs to coordinate I/O service and process execution. Our experiments on a 120-node cluster using the PVFS2 file system show that Dual Par can increase system I/O throughput by 31% on average, compared to existing MPI-IO with or without using collective I/O.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6267847/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12935991","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Data-driven Execution of Parallel Programs for Efficient I/O Services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Data-driven Execution of Parallel Programs for Efficient I/O Services","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080795S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6267850,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Shaheen","affiliation":["Integrative Scientific Computing Group, Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Shaheen","id":"37410002600"},{"name":"Robert Strzodka","affiliation":["Integrative Scientific Computing Group, Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Strzodka","id":"37282542600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4675-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6267850","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"abstract":"Temporal blocking in iterative stencil computations allows to surpass the performance of peak system bandwidth that holds for a single stencil computation. However, the effectiveness of temporal blocking depends strongly on the tiling scheme, which must account for the contradicting goals of spatio-temporal data locality, regular memory access patterns, parallelization into many independent tasks, and datato-core affinity for NUMA-aware data distribution. Despite the prevalence of cache coherent non-uniform memory access (ccNUMA) in todays many-core systems, this latter aspect has been largely ignored in the development of temporal blocking algorithms. Building upon previous cache-aware [1] and cacheoblivious [2] schemes, this paper develops their NUMA-aware variants, explaining why the incorporation of data-to-core affinity as an equally important goal necessitates also new tiling and parallelization strategies. Results are presented on an 8 socket dual-core and a 4 socket oct-core systems and compared against an optimized naive scheme, various peak performance characteristics, and related schemes from literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267850.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"473","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NUMA Aware Iterative Stencil Computations on Many-Core Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Instruction sets","Bandwidth","Synchronization","Kernel","Scalability","Cats"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","iterative methods","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform memory access aware iterative stencil computation","many-core system","tiling scheme","contradicting goal","spatio-temporal data locality","regular memory access pattern","independent task","data-to-core affinity","NUMA-aware data distribution","cache coherent nonuniform memory access","temporal blocking algorithm","cache-aware scheme","cache-oblivious scheme","NUMA-aware variant","tiling strategy","parallelization strategy","8 socket dual-core system","4 socket oct-core system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stencil computation","temporal blocking","NUMA-aware data distribution","affinity","cache-oblivious","cache-aware","parallelism and locality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"NUMA Aware Iterative Stencil Computations on Many-Core Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6267850/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12935994","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NUMA Aware Iterative Stencil Computations on Many-Core Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070729S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6267858,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Bueno","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Bueno","id":"37845444500"},{"name":"Judit Planas","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain"],"firstName":"Judit","lastName":"Planas","id":"38295001600"},{"name":"Alejandro Duran","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Duran","id":"37274953900"},{"name":"Rosa M.

We present the implementation of OmpSs for clusters of GPUs, which supports asynchrony and heterogeneity for task parallelism. It is based on annotating a serial application with directives that are translated by the compiler. With it, the same program that runs sequentially in a node with a single GPU can run in parallel in multiple GPUs either local (single node) or remote (cluster of GPUs). Besides performing a task-based parallelization, the runtime system moves the data as needed between the different nodes and GPUs minimizing the impact of communication by using affinity scheduling, caching, and by overlapping communication with the computational task. We show several applications programmed with OmpSs and their performance with multiple GPUs in a local node and in remote nodes.

Services in the cloud computing networks may be virtualized with specific servers which host abstracted details. Some of the servers are active and available, while others are busy or heavy loaded, and the remaining are offline for various reasons. Users would expect the right and available servers to complete their application requirements. Therefore, in order to provide an effective control scheme with parameter guidance for cloud resource services, failure detection is essential to meet users' service expectations. It can resolve possible performance bottlenecks in providing the virtual service for the cloud computing networks. Most existing Failure Detector (FD) schemes do not automatically adjust their detection service parameters for the dynamic network conditions, thus they couldn't be used for actual application. This paper explores FD properties with relation to the actual and automatic fault-tolerant cloud computing networks, and find a general non-manual analysis method to self-tune the corresponding parameters to satisfy user requirements. Based on this general automatic method, we propose specific and dynamic Self-tuning Failure Detector, called SFD, as a major breakthrough in the existing schemes. We carry out actual and extensive experiments to compare the quality of service performance between the SFD and several other existing FDs. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can automatically adjust SFD control parameters to obtain corresponding services and satisfy user requirements, while maintaining good performance. Such an SFD can be extensively applied to industrial and commercial usage, and it can also significantly benefit the cloud computing networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12936011","htmlLink":"/document/6267868/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Self-tuning Failure Detection Scheme for Cloud Computing Service","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-tuning Failure Detection Scheme for Cloud Computing Service","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124658S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6267870,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science & Eng, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37678323300"},{"name":"Jih-Kwon Peir","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Science & Eng, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jih-Kwon","lastName":"Peir","id":"37294178300"},{"name":"Victor Lee","affiliation":["Parallel Computing Lab, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lee","id":"37390972100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4675-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6267870","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Correlation","Bandwidth","Random access memory","Encoding","History","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","data compression","DRAM chips","encoding","meta data","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miss-correlation folding","per-block miss correlations encoding","compressed DRAM","data prefetching","repeated streaming behavior","correlation-based prefetchers","missing streams","off-chip DRAM","access latency","memory bandwidth","performance degradation","data compression technique","unbounded correlation history","prefetch metadata","demand data","data-parallel applications","regular stream prefetcher","sampled temporal streaming prefetcher","spatial-temporal memory streaming prefetcher","IPC improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["prefetch","data parallel","miss correlation","compress","cache","temporal","spatial"]}],"abstract":"Cache misses frequently exhibit repeated streaming behavior, i.e. a sequence of cache misses has a high tendency of being repeated. Correlation-based prefetchers record the missing streams in a history table for accurate prefetching. Saving a large miss history in off-chip DRAM is a practical implementation, but incurs access latency and consumes memory bandwidth which leads to performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate a new data prefetching mechanism based on per-block miss correlation where a miss is correlated with an earlier miss when the two misses are closely encountered both in time and space. The miss correlations are captured dynamically and saved along with the content of the data block using a simple data compression technique. As a result of this novel combination, our scheme provides unbounded correlation history and its prefetch metadata can be fetched together with demand data without incurring additional latency nor consuming any memory bandwidth. Performance evaluations using data-parallel applications demonstrate that prefetchers based on per-block miss correlations can improve IPC by 42-139% with an average of 88% compared to the IPC without prefetching. In comparison with regular stream prefetcher, sampled temporal streaming prefetcher and spatial-temporal memory streaming prefetcher, up to 115%, 99% and 98% IPC improvement can be obtained with an average about 36%, 26% and 27% respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.68","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267870.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miss-Correlation Folding: Encoding Per-Block Miss Correlations in Compressed DRAM for Data Prefetching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267870/","displayDocTitle":"Miss-Correlation Folding: Encoding Per-Block Miss Correlations in Compressed DRAM for Data Prefetching","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6267870/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12936013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miss-Correlation Folding: Encoding Per-Block Miss Correlations in Compressed DRAM for Data Prefetching","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109185S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6267882,"authors":[{"name":"Xuechen Zhang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Xuechen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405064800"},{"name":"Kei Davis","affiliation":["CCS Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Davis","id":"37282656500"},{"name":"Song Jiang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279383900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4675-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6267882","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":624},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267882","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Throughput","Servers","Hard disks","Linux","Benchmark testing","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","DRAM chips","hard discs","Linux","operating system kernels","parallel processing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iTransformer","SSD","disk scheduling","high-performance I/O","parallel data access","large-scale data-intensive scientific computing","data server","I/O concurrency","concurrent request","hard disk","disk head thrashing","disk region","I/O performance","storage system","disk scheduler","request scheduling","disk access time","dirty data","system failure","storage device","HPC environment","DRAM","buffer","data prefetch","random disk access","process request","nonvolatile memory","Linux kernel","PVFS2","I/O throughput","MPI/IO benchmark","data access pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disk Scheduler","Solid State Drive","Shared Storage"]}],"abstract":"The parallel data accesses inherent to large-scale data-intensive scientific computing require that data servers handle very high I/O concurrency. Concurrent requests from different processes or programs to hard disk can cause disk head thrashing between different disk regions, resulting in unacceptably low I/O performance. Current storage systems either rely on the disk scheduler at each data server, or use SSD as storage, to minimize this negative performance effect. However, the ability of the scheduler to alleviate this problem by scheduling requests in memory is limited by concerns such as long disk access times, and potential loss of dirty data with system failure. Meanwhile, SSD is too expensive to be widely used as the major storage device in the HPC environment. We propose iTransformer, a scheme that employs a small SSD to schedule requests for the data on disk. Being less space constrained than with more expensive DRAM, iTransformer can buffer larger amounts of dirty data before writing it back to the disk, or prefetch a larger volume of data in a batch into the SSD. In both cases high disk efficiency can be maintained even for concurrent requests. Furthermore, the scheme allows the scheduling of requests in the background to hide the cost of random disk access behind serving process requests. Finally, as a non-volatile memory, concerns about the quantity of dirty data are obviated. We have implemented iTransformer in the Linux kernel and tested it on a large cluster running PVFS2. Our experiments show that iTransformer can improve the I/O throughput of the cluster by 35% on average for MPI/IO benchmarks of various data access patterns.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.70","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267882.pdf","startPage":"715","endPage":"726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iTransformer: Using SSD to Improve Disk Scheduling for High-performance I/O","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"iTransformer: Using SSD to Improve Disk Scheduling for High-performance I/O","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12936024","htmlLink":"/document/6267882/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iTransformer: Using SSD to Improve Disk Scheduling for High-performance I/O","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.201888S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6267886,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Huang","id":"37900674100"},{"name":"Xiangyong Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyong","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37407724900"},{"name":"Jithin Jose","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jithin","lastName":"Jose","id":"37890118700"},{"name":"Md.

It is being used in many data-center Papplications (e.g. Face book, Twitter, etc.) because of its portability and massive scalability. For this kind of system, low latency and high throughput is expected when supporting services for large scale concurrent accesses. However, the existing HBase implementation is built upon Java Sockets Interface that provides sub-optimal performance due to the overhead to provide cross-platform portability. The byte-stream oriented Java sockets semantics confine the possibility to leverage new generations of network technologies. This makes it hard to provide high performance services for data-intensive applications. High Performance Computing (HPC) domain has exploited high performance and low latency networks such as Infini Band for many years. These interconnects provide advanced network features, such as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), to achieve high throughput and low latency along with low CPU utilization. RDMA follows memory-block semantics, which can be adopted efficiently to satisfy the object transmission primitives used in HBase. In this paper, we present a novel design of HBase for RDMA capable networks via Java Native Interface (JNI). Our design extends the existing open-source HBase software and makes it RDMA capable. Our performance evaluation reveals that latency of HBase Get operations of 1KB message size can be reduced to 43.7\u03bcs with the new design on QDR platform (32 Gbps). This is about a factor of 3.5 improvement over 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GigE) network with TCP Offload. Throughput evaluations using four HBase region servers and 64 clients indicate that the new design boosts up throughput by 3 X times over 1 GigE and 10 GigE networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is first HBase design utilizing high performance RDMA capable interconnects.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267886.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.74","startPage":"774","endPage":"785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance Design of HBase with RDMA over InfiniBand","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267886/","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Design of HBase with RDMA over InfiniBand","htmlLink":"/document/6267886/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12936028","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Design of HBase with RDMA over InfiniBand","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094543S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6267901,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Li","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Li","id":"37067314500"},{"name":"Jeffrey S.

To improve power efficiency of future HPC systems, non-volatile memory (NVRAM) technologies are being investigated as potential alternatives to existing memories technologies. NVRAMs use extremely low power when in standby mode, and have other performance and scaling benefits. Although previous work has explored the integration of NVRAM into various architecture and system levels, an open question remains: do specific memory workload characteristics of scientific applications map well onto NVRAMs' features when used in a hybrid NVRAM-DRAM memory system? Furthermore, are there common classes of data structures used by scientific applications that should be frequently placed into NVRAM?In this paper, we analyze several mission-critical scientific applications in order to answer these questions. Specifically, we develop a binary instrumentation tool to statistically report memory access patterns in stack, heap, and global data. We carry out hardware simulation to study the impact of NVRAM for both memory power and system performance. Our study identifies many opportunities for using NVRAM for scientific applications. In two of our applications, 31% and 27% of the memory working sets are suitable for NVRAM. Our simulations suggest at least 27% possible power savings and reveal that the performance of some applications is insensitive to relatively long NVRAM write-access latencies.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.89","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267901.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying Opportunities for Byte-Addressable Non-Volatile Memory in Extreme-Scale Scientific Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Identifying Opportunities for Byte-Addressable Non-Volatile Memory in Extreme-Scale Scientific Applications","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6267901/","accessionNumber":"12936043","publicationDate":"May 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying Opportunities for Byte-Addressable Non-Volatile Memory in Extreme-Scale Scientific Applications","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065078S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6267902,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"38468976300"},{"name":"Sudharshan S.

On future multi-petaflop and exaflop machines, the memory pressure is likely to be so severe that we need to rethink our memory usage models. Fortunately, the advent of non-volatile memory (NVM) offers a unique opportunity in this space. Current NVM offerings possess several desirable properties, such as low cost and power efficiency, but suffer from high latency and lifetime issues. We need rich techniques to be able to use them alongside DRAM. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for exploiting NVM as a secondary memory partition so that applications can explicitly allocate and manipulate memory regions therein. More specifically, we propose an NVMalloc library with a suite of services that enables applications to access a distributed NVM storage system. We have devised ways within NVMalloc so that the storage system, built from compute node-local NVM devices, can be accessed in a byte-addressable fashion using the memory mapped I/O interface. Our approach has the potential to re-energize out-of-core computations on large-scale machines by having applications allocate certain variables through NVMalloc, thereby increasing the overall memory capacity available. Our evaluation on a 128-core cluster shows that NVMalloc enables applications to compute problem sizes larger than the physical memory in a cost-effective manner. It can bring more performance/efficiency gain with increased computation time between NVM memory accesses or increased data access locality. In addition, our results suggest that while NVMalloc enables transparent access to NVM-resident variables, the explicit control it provides is crucial to optimize application performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6267902/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12936044","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"NVMalloc: Exposing an Aggregate SSD Store as a Memory Partition in Extreme-Scale Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NVMalloc: Exposing an Aggregate SSD Store as a Memory Partition in Extreme-Scale Machines","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675a957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119516S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6267915,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Sclocco","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Sclocco","id":"38468656200"},{"name":"Ana Lucia Varbanescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ana Lucia","lastName":"Varbanescu","id":"37698034900"},{"name":"Jan David Mol","affiliation":["Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, ASTRON, Dwingeloo, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jan David","lastName":"Mol","id":"37400599600"},{"name":"Rob V. van Nieuwpoort","affiliation":["Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, ASTRON, Dwingeloo, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Rob V.","lastName":"van Nieuwpoort","id":"37284701900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4675-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6267915","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telescopes","Graphics processing unit","Radio astronomy","Algorithm design and analysis","Instruction sets","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","array signal processing","astronomy computing","cellular radio","graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","omnidirectional antennas","parallel architectures","parallel machines","radiotelescopes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio astronomy","beamforming","manycore architecture","radio telescope","steel dish","LOFAR","omnidirectional antenna","signal processing","next generation telescope","SKA","Wi-Fi","4G cellular network","radar system","health care microwave imaging instrument","GPU","CUDA","OpenCL","OpenMP","SSE vector instruction","autotuning","IBM Blue Gene-P supercomputer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio astronomy","many-core architectures","beam forming","auto tuning"]}],"abstract":"Traditional radio telescopes use large steel dishes to observe radio sources. The largest radio telescope in the world, LOFAR, uses tens of thousands of fixed, omni-directional antennas instead, a novel design that promises ground-breaking research in astronomy. Where traditional tele-scopes use custom-built hardware, LOFAR uses software to do signal processing in real time. This leads to an instrument that is inherently more flexible. However, the enormous data rates and processing requirements (tens to hundreds of teraflops) make this extremely challenging. The next-generation telescope, the SKA, will require exaflops. Unlike traditional instruments, LOFAR and SKA can observe in hundreds of directions simultaneously, using beam forming. This is useful, for example, to search the sky for pulsars (i.e. rapidly rotating highly magnetized neutron stars). Beam forming is an important technique in signal processing: it is also used in WIFI and 4G cellular networks, radar systems, and health-care microwave imaging instruments. We propose the use of many-core architectures, such as 48-core CPU systems and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), to accelerate beam forming. We use two different frameworks for GPUs, CUDA and Open CL, and present results for hardware from different vendors (i.e. AMD and NVIDIA). Additionally, we implement the LOFAR beam former on multi-core CPUs, using Open MP with SSE vector instructions. We use auto-tuning to support different architectures and implementation frameworks, achieving both platform and performance portability. Finally, we compare our results with the production implementation, written in assembly and running on an IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer. We compare both computational and power efficiency, since power usage is one of the fundamental challenges modern radio telescopes face. Compared to the production implementation, our auto-tuned beam former is 45-50 times faster on GPUs, and 2-8 times more power efficient. Our experimental results lead to the conclusion that GPUs are an attractive solution to accelerate beam forming.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.102","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267915.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.102","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio Astronomy Beam Forming on Many-Core Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Radio Astronomy Beam Forming on Many-Core Architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267915/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6267915/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12936056","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Astronomy Beam Forming on Many-Core Architectures","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675b105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05877S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6267916,"authors":[{"name":"George Kurian","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Kurian","id":"37402343600"},{"name":"Chen Sun","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085587456"},{"name":"Chia-Hsin Owen Chen","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsin Owen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539294500"},{"name":"Jason E.

However, since standard simulation tools have not yet caught up with these advances, the quality and thoroughness of the evaluations of these architectures have varied widely. This paper provides the first complete end-to-end analysis of an architecture using on-chip optical interconnect. This analysis incorporates realistic performance and energy models for both electrical and optical devices and circuits into a full-fledged functional simulator, thus enabling detailed analyses when running actual applications. Since on-chip optics is not yet mature and unlikely to see widespread use for several more years, we perform our analysis on a future 1000-core processor implemented in an 11nm technology node. We find that the proposed optical interconnect can provide between 1.8x and 4.8x better energy-delay product than conventional electrical-only interconnects. In addition, based on a detailed energy breakdown of all processor components, we conclude that a thermal ring resonators and on-chip lasers that allow rapid power gating are key areas worthy of additional nanophotonic research. This will help guide future optical device research to the areas likely to provide the best payoff.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2012.103","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6266782/6267817/06267916.pdf","startPage":"1117","endPage":"1130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6267916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer Energy and Performance Evaluation of a Nanophotonic Manycore Processor System Using Real Application Workloads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer Energy and Performance Evaluation of a Nanophotonic Manycore Processor System Using Real Application Workloads","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12936057","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6267916/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer Energy and Performance Evaluation of a Nanophotonic Manycore Processor System Using Real Application Workloads","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675b117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086747S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6267919,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Such simulations often spend a majority of their run-times solving large systems of linear equations that require vast amounts of computational power and memory. It is hence critical to design solvers in a highly efficient and scalable manner. Hypre is a high performance, scalable software library that offers several optimized linear solver routines and pre-conditioners. In this paper, we study the characteristics of Hypre's Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) solver algorithm. The PCG routine is known to spend a majority of its communication time in the MPI All reduce operation to compute a global summation during the inner product operation. The MPI All reduce is a blocking operation, whose latency is often a limiting factor to the overall efficiency of the PCG solver routine, and correspondingly the performance of simulations that rely on this solver. Hence, hiding the latency of the MPI All reduce operation is critical towards scaling the PCG solver routine and improving the performance of many simulations. The upcoming revision of MPI, MPI-3, will provide support for non-blocking collective communication to enable latency-hiding. The latest InfiniBand adapter from Mellanox, ConnectX-2, enables offloading of generalized lists of communication operations to the network interface. Such an interface can be leveraged to design non-blocking collective operations. In this paper, we design fully functional, scalable algorithms for the MPI_Iallreduce operation, based on the network offload technology. To the best of our knowledge, these network offload-based algorithms are the first to be presented for the MPI_Iallreduce operation. Our designs scale beyond 512 processes and we achieve near perfect communication/computation overlap. We also re-design the PCG solver routine to leverage our proposed MPI_Iallreduce operation to hide the latency of the global reduction operations. We observe up to 21% improvements in the run-times of the PCG routine, when compared to the default PCG implementation in Hypre. We also note that about 16% of the overall benefits are due to overlapping the All reduce operations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6267919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6267919/","accessionNumber":"12936060","displayDocTitle":"Designing Non-blocking Allreduce with Collective Offload on InfiniBand Clusters: A Case Study with Conjugate Gradient Solvers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Non-blocking Allreduce with Collective Offload on InfiniBand Clusters: A Case Study with Conjugate Gradient Solvers","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4675b156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093438S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6266782","isNumber":"6267817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6266782","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6267817","articleId":"6267919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6268282,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jia","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Wei Jia received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2009.

The system is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated as the high-speed interface between eNodeB and a relay node. The LTE signals under test comprise three different modulation schemes, namely, quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK), 16-quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM), and 64-QAM, which are modulated onto orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) at 2.6 GHz. The RoF system design is based on the distributed feedback (DFB) laser direct modulation and direct detection receiver. The spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) considering the third-order intermodulation analysis of the DFB laser achieved 1.93-dB dynamic range gain to improve the modulation efficiency. The practical investigation reveals three distinctive optical power transmission regions, namely, linear, intermixing, and nonlinear regions.

The proposed topology and method of fabrication improves the out of band rejection above the pass band in comparison with other classical structures, while keeping a low insertion loss level. A two-fold geometry for implementing a transmission zero is proposed, avoiding the excitation of the first higher order mode and easing the manufacturing without any tuning element. A low-cost milling process is used for the fabrication of the device. The final design fulfills the desired specifications and presents 0.6 dB of insertion loss level at 100 GHz. The excellent agreement between simulations and measurements at this frequency band in both, return loss and insertion loss, is pointed out.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/6291805/06268297.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2012.2212237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2012.2212237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6291805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Loss Elliptical Response Filter at 100 GHz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insertion loss","Filtering theory","Loss measurement","Microwave filters","Fabrication","Radar","Milling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","elliptic filters","millimetre wave filters","milling","radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-loss elliptical response filter","pseudo-elliptical four-poles asymmetric response filter","fractional bandwidth","image radar system","fabrication method","out of band rejection","low insertion loss level","two-fold geometry","transmission zero","higher order mode","low-cost milling process","return loss","insertion loss","frequency 100 GHz","loss 0.6 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetric","extracted pole","filter","low loss","milling","W-band"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low-Loss Elliptical Response Filter at 100 GHz","volume":"22","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6268297/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12961110","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Loss Elliptical Response Filter at 100 GHz","sourcePdf":"lmwc-lealsevillano-2212237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048813S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"6291805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6291805","articleId":"6268297","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6268301,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Soleimani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6359940/6268301/6268301-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamid Soleimani received the B.

This paper presents a set of piecewise linear spiking neuron models, which can reproduce different behaviors, similar to the biological neuron, both for a single neuron as well as a network of neurons. The proposed models are investigated, in terms of digital implementation feasibility and costs, targeting large scale hardware implementation. Hardware synthesis and physical implementations on FPGA show that the proposed models can produce precise neural behaviors with higher performance and considerably lower implementation costs compared with the original model. Accordingly, a compact structure of the models which can be trained with supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms has been developed. Using this structure and based on a spike rate coding, a character recognition case study has been implemented and tested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","volume":"59","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13146665","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268301/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Biologically Inspired Spiking Neurons: Piecewise Linear Models and Digital Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biologically Inspired Spiking Neurons: Piecewise Linear Models and Digital Implementation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ahmadi-2206463-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120276S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6359940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6359940","articleId":"6268301","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6268302,"authors":[{"name":"James Ernest Green","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6486561/6268302/6268302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["James Ernest Green was born in London, U.K., in 1985.

This study presents a 10-ms 18-band quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank for processing 24 kHz audio signals. We first discuss a filter order optimization algorithm to define the quasi-ANSI filters. The group delay constraint of filters is limited to 10 ms. The proposed design adopts an efficient prescription-fitting algorithm to reduce inter-band interference, enabling the proposed quasi-ANSI filter bank to compensate any type of hearing loss (HL) using the NAL-NL1 or HSE prescription formulas. Simulation results reveal that the maximum matching error in the prescriptions of the mild HL, moderate HL, and severe-to-profound HL is less than 1.5 dB. This study also investigates the complexity-effective multirate IFIR quasi-ANSI filter bank. For an 18-band digital hearing aid with a 24 kHz sampling rate, the proposed architecture eliminates approximately 93% of the multiplications and up to 74% of the storage elements, compared with a parallel FIR filters architecture. The proposed analysis filter bank (AFB) was designed in UMC 90 nm CMOS high-VT technology, and on the basis of post-layout simulations, it consumes 73 \u03bcW (@V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n=1 V). By voltage scaling (to 0.6 V), the simulation results show that the power consumption decreases to 27 \u03bcW, which is approximately 30% of that consumed by the most energy-efficient AFB available in the literature for use in hearing aids.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6468162/06268303.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"649","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2209731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2209731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6468162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"10-ms 18-Band Quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-Octave Filter Bank for Digital Hearing Aids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"10-ms 18-Band Quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-Octave Filter Bank for Digital Hearing Aids","htmlLink":"/document/6268303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13325851","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"10-ms 18-Band Quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-Octave Filter Bank for Digital Hearing Aids","sourcePdf":"tcsi-liu-2209731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109607S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6468162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6468162","articleId":"6268303","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6268310,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The control design for the DG inverters employs a new Model Predictive Control algorithm that allows faster computational time for large power systems by optimizing the steady-state and the transient control problems separately. An overall energy management system is also implemented for the microgrid to coordinate load sharing among different DG units during both grid-connected and islanded operations. The design concept of the proposed control system is evaluated through simulation studies under different test scenarios. The impact of the increased penetration of DG units on the distribution grid is also investigated using the proposed microgrid. The simulation results show that the operations of the DG units within the microgrid can be coordinated effectively under the proposed control system to ensure stable operation of the overall microgrid.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2205952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6397636/06268310.pdf","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2205952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized Control for Parallel Operation of Distributed Generation Inverters in Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Centralized Control for Parallel Operation of Distributed Generation Inverters in Microgrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268310/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13190962","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6268310/","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centralized Control for Parallel Operation of Distributed Generation Inverters in Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tsg-so-2205952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085916S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6268310","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":6268312,"authors":[{"name":"Gauthier Delille","affiliation":["Department Economic and Technical Analysis of Energy Systems (EFESE), EDF-Research and Development, Clamart, France"],"firstName":"Gauthier","lastName":"Delille","id":"38483205600"},{"name":"Bruno Francois","affiliation":["Communaute d'Universites et d'Etablissements Lille Nord de France, Villeneuve d'Ascq, Hauts-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Francois","id":"37270029700"},{"name":"Gilles Malarange","affiliation":["Department Economic and Technical Analysis of Energy Systems (EFESE), EDF-Research and Development, Clamart, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Malarange","id":"37591096800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3029"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3037"}],"articleNumber":"6268312","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":429,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6075},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency control","Power system dynamics","Power system stability","Solar power generation","Energy storage","Wind power generation","Supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","frequency control","load shedding","power generation control","power grids","solar power stations","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind generation","solar generation","dynamic frequency control","energy storage","isolated power system inertia","electrical islands","frequency excursions","automatic load shedding","disturbance response","wind plants","solar plants","generating unit","French island","Guadeloupe","fast-acting storage","island grid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency control","isolated power systems","power system dynamic stability","power system security","solar power generation","supercapacitors","wind power generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268312","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165391/6299423/06268312.pdf","startPage":"931","endPage":"939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2012.2205025","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2012.2205025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6299423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Frequency Control Support by Energy Storage to Reduce the Impact of Wind and Solar Generation on Isolated Power System's Inertia","abstract":"In electrical islands, frequency excursions are sizeable and automatic load shedding is often required in response to disturbances. Moreover, the displacement of conventional generation with wind and solar plants, which usually do not provide inertial response, further weakens these power systems. Fast-acting storage, by injecting power within instants after the loss of a generating unit, can back up conventional generation assets during the activation of their primary reserve. This paper relies on dynamic simulations to study the provision of such a dynamic frequency control support by energy storage systems in the French island of Guadeloupe with large shares of wind or solar generation. The results show that fast-acting storage, by acting as a synthetic inertia, can mitigate the impact of these sources on the dynamic performance of the studied island grid in the case of a major generation outage. The other concerns raised by renewables (e.g., variability, forecast accuracy, low voltage ride-through, etc.) have not been addressed within this project.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","volume":"3","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13030555","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Frequency Control Support by Energy Storage to Reduce the Impact of Wind and Solar Generation on Isolated Power System's Inertia","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Frequency Control Support by Energy Storage to Reduce the Impact of Wind and Solar Generation on Isolated Power System's Inertia","sourcePdf":"tste-delille-2205025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043341S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","isNumber":"6299423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"429","articleId":"6268312","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6268313,"authors":[{"name":"Nivad Navid","affiliation":["Market Development and Analysis, Midwest ISO, Carmel, IN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nivad Navid (SM'98) received the Ph.D. degree from McGill University, Montreal, Canada.","He is a consulting engineer in the Market Development and Analysis Department, Midwest ISO.

One important focus has been on the analysis of brain connectivity using the concept of networks instead of regions. Approximately ten years ago, two important research areas grew out of this concept. First, a network proposed to be \u201ca default mode of brain function\u201d since dubbed the default mode network was proposed by Raichle. Secondly, multisubject or group independent component analysis (ICA) provided a data-driven approach to study properties of brain networks, including the default mode network. In this paper, we provide a focused review of how ICA has contributed to the study of intrinsic networks. We discuss some methodological considerations for group ICA and highlight multiple analytic approaches for studying brain networks. We also show examples of some of the differences observed in the default mode and resting networks in the diseased brain. In summary, we are in exciting times and still just beginning to reap the benefits of the richness of functional brain networks as well as available analytic approaches.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268324","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Independent component analysis","Brain","Magnetic resonance imaging","Higher

First, a general actuator fault model that integrated varying bias and gain faults, which are assumed to be dependent on the system state, is proposed. Then, sliding mode observers (SMOs) are designed to provide a bank of residuals for fault detection and isolation. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a novel fault diagnostic algorithm is proposed, which removes the classical assumption that the time derivative of the output error should be known. Further, for the two cases where the state is available or not, two accommodation schemes are proposed to compensate for the effect of the faults. These schemes do not need the condition that the bounds of the time derivative of the faults should be known. In addition, a sufficient condition for the existence of SMOs is derived according to Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation results of NSV are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed FTC approach.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2213092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6488749/06268340.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2213092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6488749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Logic System-Based Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control for Near-Space Vehicle Attitude Dynamics With Actuator Faults","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268340/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Logic System-Based Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control for Near-Space Vehicle Attitude Dynamics With Actuator Faults","volume":"21","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13401166","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6268340/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Logic System-Based Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control for Near-Space Vehicle Attitude Dynamics With Actuator Faults","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-jiang-2213092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085162S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6488749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6488749","articleId":"6268340","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6268350,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Wook Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6361507/6268350/6268350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ji-Wook Kwon received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, Korea, in 2005, 2007, and 2012, respectively.","He was a Visiting Researcher with the Institute of Science and Technology of Yvelines, University of Versailles St-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Mante la Jolie, France, in 2009.

Previously, many researchers have dealt with the control laws for the rigid formation, where the line of sight toward the leader is controlled for the leader-follower formation control. However, a width change or a collision of the formation can occur since a limited motion of the rigid formation can occur when the formation control maintains the line of sight. Therefore, the formation of multiple mobile robots is required to be flexible, keeping the width and curvature of the formation. To this end, a formation control law based on a vector field method is proposed, and a hierarchical formation structure is introduced in such a way that it consists of a line formation and a column formation based on the leader-follower formation strategy. First, a subgroup, which consists of several robots, is generated using the line formation, and then, the overall formation structure is constructed from several subgroups using the column formation. Finally, we show the stability of the whole formation. The stability analysis and simulation results of the proposed hierarchical formation control using this vector field method are included to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2012.2206869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6361507/06268350.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2012.2206869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361507","startPage":"1335","endPage":"1345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Formation Control Based on a Vector Field Method for Wheeled Mobile Robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Formation Control Based on a Vector Field Method for Wheeled Mobile Robots","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13166957","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268350/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Formation Control Based on a Vector Field Method for Wheeled Mobile Robots","sourcePdf":"tro-chwa-2206869-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079488S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6361507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6361507","articleId":"6268350","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6268351,"authors":[{"name":"\u0130lhan Polat","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"\u0130lhan","lastName":"Polat","id":"38525091600"},{"name":"Carsten W.

Frequently used robust stability conditions originating from network theory in the face of passive human and environment operators are shown to be particular cases in this framework.

Using this unified approach, different uncertainty classes can be incorporated into the stability test simultaneously. A few commonly encountered uncertainty types and the corresponding stability analysis tests are derived and numerically illustrated for a simple teleoperation system.

This work devises a complex negotiation mechanism that supports negotiation activities among three types of participants in multiple interrelated markets. The complex negotiation mechanism consists of: 1) a bargaining-position-estimation (BPE) strategy for the multilateral negotiations between consumer and broker agents in a service market and 2) a regression-based coordination (RBC) strategy for concurrent negotiations between broker and provider agents in multiple resource markets. The negotiation outcomes between broker and provider agents in a resource market can potentially influence the negotiation outcomes between broker and consumer agents in a service market. Empirical results show that agents adopting the BPE strategy can better respond to different market conditions than agents adopting the time-dependent strategy because they do not make excessive (respectively, inadequate) amounts of concessions in favorable (respectively, unfavorable) markets. In the concurrent negotiations in multiple resource markets, empirical results show that broker agents adopting the RBC strategy achieved significantly higher utilities, higher success rates, and faster negotiation speed than broker agents adopting the utility-oriented and patient coordination strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2204742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221036/6340245/06268353.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2204742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340245","startPage":"230","endPage":"245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex and Concurrent Negotiations for Multiple Interrelated e-Markets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Complex and Concurrent Negotiations for Multiple Interrelated e-Markets","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13256799","pubMedId":"22907968","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6268353/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex and Concurrent Negotiations for Multiple Interrelated e-Markets","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-sim-2204742-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115447S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6340245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6340245","articleId":"6268353","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6268354,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Hui Zhan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Digital Life, Ministry of Education, China","Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6479286/6268354/6268354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi-Hui Zhan (S'09) received the Bachelor's degree in computer science and technology from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, differential evolution, brain storm optimization, and their applications in real-world problems."]},"firstName":"Zhi-Hui","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37392529300"},{"name":"Jingjing Li","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jingjing Li is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.","Her research interests are mainly focused on evolutionary algorithm, energy efficient routing, and object tracking for wireless sensor networks."]},"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Li","id":"38569376100"},{"name":"Jiannong Cao","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6479286/6268354/6268354-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Jiannong Cao (M'93\u2013SM'05) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Washington State University, Pullman.","He is currently a Chair Professor and the Head of the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

However, this consideration may cause difficulty to assign fitness to individuals because different objectives often conflict with each other. In order to avoid this difficulty, this paper proposes a novel coevolutionary technique named multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMO) when developing MOEAs. The novelty of MPMO is that it provides a simple and straightforward way to solve MOPs by letting each population correspond with only one objective. This way, the fitness assignment problem can be addressed because the individuals' fitness in each population can be assigned by the corresponding objective. MPMO is a general technique that each population can use existing optimization algorithms. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is adopted for each population, and coevolutionary multiswarm PSO (CMPSO) is developed based on the MPMO technique. Furthermore, CMPSO is novel and effective by using an external shared archive for different populations to exchange search information and by using two novel designs to enhance the performance. One design is to modify the velocity update equation to use the search information found by different populations to approximate the whole Pareto front (PF) fast. The other design is to use an elitist learning strategy for the archive update to bring in diversity to avoid local PFs. CMPSO is comprehensively tested on different sets of benchmark problems with different characteristics and is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show that CMPSO has superior performance in solving these different sets of MOPs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","volume":"43","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13383950","pubMedId":"22907971","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6268354/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Populations for Multiple Objectives: A Coevolutionary Technique for Solving Multiobjective Optimization Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Populations for Multiple Objectives: A Coevolutionary Technique for Solving Multiobjective Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zhang-2209115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.230968S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6479286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"6479286","articleId":"6268354","onlineDate":"07 March 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":6268359,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Rong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University of Technology, Bentley, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6357313/6268359/6268359-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yue Rong (S'03\u2013M'06\u2013SM'11) received the B.Eng. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, the M.Sc. degree from the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany, and the Ph.D. degree (summa cum laude) from Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany, all in electrical engineering, in 1999, 2002, and 2005, respectively.","From February 2006 to November 2007, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside.

We show that for a broad class of frequently used objective functions for MIMO communications such as the MMSE, the maximal mutual information (MMI), and the minimax MSE, the optimal relay and source matrices have a general beamforming structure. This result includes existing works as special cases. Based on this optimal structure, a new iterative algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the relay and source matrices. We also propose a novel suboptimal relay precoding matrix design which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the optimal design with only a marginal performance degradation. Interestingly, we show that this suboptimal relay matrix is indeed optimal for some special cases. The performance of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by numerical simulations.

Both the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper are equipped with multiple antennas and employ maximal ratio combining (MRC) reception scheme. With the presence of channel diversity, we find the closed-form expressions for the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity and the outage probability of secrecy capacity in terms of channel parameters such as correlation coefficient and the ratio of main and eavesdropper channel gains that will be called average channel gain ratio (CGR). The analysis of secure outage performance with the MRC diversity scheme tells how the channel diversity enhances the secrecy capacity. We quantify the effect of antenna correlation on the probability of positive secrecy capacity and the secure outage probability. We also investigate how the target secrecy rate influences the effect of antenna correlation on the secure outage probability. Moreover, as a result of obtaining the closed-form expressions for the probability of positive secrecy capacity and the outage probability, it is insightful to see how the channel parameters affect the secure outage performance of the correlated channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268360/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136698","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Security in Correlated Channel With Maximal Ratio Combining Diversity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Security in Correlated Channel With Maximal Ratio Combining Diversity","sourcePdf":"tsp-sarkar-2213080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086949S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6357313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6357313","articleId":"6268360","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6268361,"authors":[{"name":"Dae Hyun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Dae Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"38596635200"},{"name":"Krit Athikulwongse","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Krit","lastName":"Athikulwongse","id":"37409405800"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280563100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6268361","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1212},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268361","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Force","Logic gates","Routing","Layout","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit layout","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D IC","TSV assignment algorithms","irregular TSV placement","regular TSV placement","TSV site","TSV coplacement","wirelength reduction","ill-managed TSV","3D integrated chips","multiple dies","single 3D stack","TSV technology","3D stacked IC layout","through-silicon-via impact"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D integrated chip (IC)","interconnect","placement","routing","through-silicon via (TSV)"]}],"abstract":"The technology of through-silicon vias (TSVs) enables fine-grained integration of multiple dies into a single 3-D stack. TSVs occupy significant silicon area due to their sheer size, which has a great effect on the quality of 3-D integrated chips (ICs). Whereas well-managed TSVs alleviate routing congestion and reduce wirelength, excessive or ill-managed TSVs increase the die area and wirelength. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the TSV on the quality of 3-D IC layouts. Two design schemes, namely TSV co-placement (irregular TSV placement) and TSV site (regular TSV placement), and accompanying algorithms to find and optimize locations of gates and TSVs are proposed for the design of 3-D ICs. Two TSV assignment algorithms are also proposed to enable the regular TSV placement. Simulation results show that the wirelength of 3-D ICs is shorter than that of 2-D ICs by up to 25%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2201760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2201760","startPage":"862","endPage":"874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6502671/06268361.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6502671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Through-Silicon-Via Impact on the 3-D Stacked IC Layout","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Study of Through-Silicon-Via Impact on the 3-D Stacked IC Layout","volume":"21","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13448924","publicationDate":"May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Through-Silicon-Via Impact on the 3-D Stacked IC Layout","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-kim-2201760-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064872S","chronDate":"May  2013","isNumber":"6502671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"54","articleId":"6268361","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6268363,"authors":[{"name":"Wanyong Tian","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6545337/6268363/6268363-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wanyong Tian received the B.E. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, China, in 2007.

Compared to the conventional memory technology DRAM, the emerging NVM has excellent energy performance since it consumes orders of magnitude less leakage power. On the other hand, most types of NVMs come with the disadvantages of much shorter write endurance and longer write latency as opposed to DRAM. By leveraging the energy efficiency of NVM and long write endurance of DRAM, this paper explores task allocation techniques on hybrid memory for multiple objectives such as minimizing the energy consumption, extending the lifetime, and minimizing the memory size. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we design the integer linear programming (ILP) formulations that can solve different objectives optimally. Then, we propose two sets of heuristic algorithms including three polynomial time offline heuristics and three online heuristics. Experiments show that compared to the optimal solutions generated by the ILP formulations, the offline heuristics can produce near-optimal results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268363/","volume":"21","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6268363/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13583410","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Task Allocation on Nonvolatile-Memory-Based Hybrid Main Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Allocation on Nonvolatile-Memory-Based Hybrid Main Memory","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-tian-2208129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.226919S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6545337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6545337","articleId":"6268363","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6268390,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Ho Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Department of Mobile Systems Engineering, Dankook University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Seok-Ho Chang (S'07\u2013M'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, in 2010.","From 1999 to 2005, he was with LG Electronics, Korea, where he was involved in development of WCDMA (UMTS) base/mobile station modem chips.

These progressive codes have gradual differences of importance in their bitstreams, which necessitates multiple levels of unequal error protection (UEP). One practical method of achieving UEP is based on a constellation of nonuniformly spaced signal points, or hierarchical constellations. However, hierarchical modulation can achieve only a limited number of UEP levels for a given constellation size. Though hierarchical modulation has been intensively studied for digital broadcasting or multimedia transmission, most work has considered only two layered source coding, and methods of achieving a large number of UEP levels for progressive transmission have rarely been studied. In this paper, we propose a multilevel UEP system using multiplexed hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). We show that multiple levels of UEP are achieved by the proposed multiplexing method. When the BER is dominated by the minimum Euclidian distance, we derive an optimal multiplexing approach which minimizes both the average and peak powers. We next propose an asymmetric hierarchical QAM which reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the proposed UEP system without any performance loss. Numerical results show that the performance of progressive transmission over Rayleigh fading channels is significantly enhanced by the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6268384/06268390.pdf","startPage":"5816","endPage":"5840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2173613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2173613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Unequal Error Protection Using Multiplexed Hierarchical Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Multiplexing","Error correction codes","Bit error rate","Constellation diagram","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer","hierarchical modulation","multimedia communications","progressive image","scalable video","unequal error protection","wireless video"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Unequal Error Protection Using Multiplexed Hierarchical Modulation","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6268390/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Unequal Error Protection Using Multiplexed Hierarchical Modulation","sourcePdf":"tit-chang-2173613-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117527S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6268384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6268384","articleId":"6268390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6268425,"authors":[{"name":"Heegon Kim","affiliation":["Terahertz Interconnection and Package Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6315989/6268425/6268425-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heegon Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include signal integrity issues in through-silicon-via-based 3-D integrated circuits and equalizer design in high-speed channels."]},"firstName":"Heegon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37858628100"},{"name":"Jonghyun Cho","affiliation":["Terahertz Interconnection and Package Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6315989/6268425/6268425-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jonghyun Cho (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His current research interests include through-silicon-via (TSV) depletion, TSV coupling modeling, and noise analysis in TSV-based 3-D integrated circuits."]},"firstName":"Jonghyun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37594787200"},{"name":"Myunghoi Kim","affiliation":["Terahertz Interconnection and Package Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6315989/6268425/6268425-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Myunghoi Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2003 and 2005, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Terahertz Interconnection and Package Laboratory.","He was a Researcher for development of advanced missile systems with the Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, from 2005 to 2008.

However, although the TSV and a silicon interposer in a high-speed TSV channel lead to a significant decrease of the interconnect length, the received digital signal after transmission through a TSV channel is still degraded at a high data-rate due to the nonidealities of the channel. Therefore, an analysis of the signal integrity in a high-speed TSV channel is necessary. In this paper, a single-ended high-speed TSV channel is measured and analyzed in the frequency-domain and the time-domain. To measure the high-speed TSV channel, two types of test vehicles are fabricated, consisting of TSVs and interposers. With these test vehicles, the channel losses are measured in the frequency-domain up to 20 GHz, and eye-diagrams are measured in the time-domain at 1 Gb/s and 10 Gb/s. Based on these measurements, the channel loss, characteristic impedance, and reflection of the high-speed TSV channel are analyzed and compared to those of the channel in multichip module (MCM) package. Because of the losses from the silicon-substrate and the thin oxide-layer used in the TSVs, the overall loss of the high-speed TSV channel is higher than that of the MCM channel. In addition, the characteristic impedance of the high-speed TSV channel is frequency-dependent, whereas that of the MCM channel is frequency-independent. Moreover, in contrast to the MCM channel, the reflection is negligible in the high-speed TSV channel because the channel is too short and the losses are too high to be affected by the reflection. Finally, the design guidance of a high-speed TSV channel for wide bandwidth is determined based on the analysis of the measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2012.2207900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6315989/06268425.pdf","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2012.2207900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6315989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and Analysis of a High-Speed TSV Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and Analysis of a High-Speed TSV Channel","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268425/","accessionNumber":"13029941","volume":"2","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and Analysis of a High-Speed TSV Channel","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-kim-2207900-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085107S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6315989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6315989","articleId":"6268425","onlineDate":"14 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6268430,"authors":[{"name":"Mahesh T.

Composed largely of a bilayer (double layer) of lipids just two molecules thick (about 5 nm), and behaving partly as a liquid and partly as a gel, the cell plasma membrane nonetheless separates and protects the cell from its surrounding environment very reliably and stably. Embedded within the lipid bilayer, also quite stably, are a number of different proteins, some of which act as channels and pumps, providing a pathway for transporting specific molecules across the membrane. Without these proteins, the membrane would be a largely impenetrable barrier. Electrically, the cell plasma membrane can be viewed as a thin insulating sheet surrounded on both sides by aqueous electrolyte solutions. When exposed to a sufficiently strong electric field, the membrane will undergo electrical breakdown, which renders it permeable to molecules that are otherwise unable to cross it. The process of rendering the membrane permeable is called membrane electroporation. Unlike solid insulators, in which an electrical breakdown generally causes permanent structural change, the membrane, with its lipids behaving as a two-dimensional liquid, can spontaneously return to its prebreakdown state. If the exposure is sufficiently short and the membrane recovery sufficiently rapid for the cell to remain viable, electroporation is termed reversible; otherwise, it is termed irreversible. Since its discovery [1]\u2013[3], electroporation has steadily gained ground as a useful tool in various areas of medicine and biotechnology. Today, reversible electroporation is an established method for introducing chemotherapeutic drugs into tumor cells (electrochemotherapy) [4]. It also offers great promise as a technique for gene therapy without the risks caused by viral vectors (DNA electrotransfer) [5]. In clinical medicine, irreversible electroporation is being investigated as a method for tissue ablation (nonthermal electroablation) [6], whereas in biotechnology, it is useful for extraction of biomolecules [7] and for microbial deactivation, particularly in food preservation [8]. This article, the first in a series of three focusing on electroporation, describes the phenomenon at the molecular level of the lipid bilayer, and then proceeds to the cellular level, explaining how exposure of a cell as a whole to an external electric field results in an inducement of voltage on its plasma membrane, its electroporation, and transport thorough the electroporated membrane. The second article will review the most important and promising applications of electroporation, and the third article will focus on the hardware for electroporation (pulse generators and electrodes) and on the need for standards, safety, and certification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"September-October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268438/","volume":"28","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6268438/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September-October 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cell membrane electroporation- Part 1: The phenomenon","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell membrane electroporation- Part 1: The phenomenon","sourcePdf":"EIM5-014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105634S","chronDate":"September-October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"57","isNumber":"6268431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"57","citationCount":"273","xplore-issue":"6268431","articleId":"6268438","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6268460,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung-Taek Lim","affiliation":["BMW Group Research and Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Hyung-Taek","lastName":"Lim","id":"37955850000"},{"name":"Daniel Herrscher","affiliation":["BMW Group Research and Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Herrscher","id":"37329222800"},{"name":"Firas Chaari","affiliation":["Telemotive AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Firas","lastName":"Chaari","id":"37087992435"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-88678-68-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0893-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6268460","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1386},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of IEEE 802.1Q and IEEE 802.1 AVB in an Ethernet-based in-vehicle network","abstract":"The traditional in-vehicle network is changing due to the increasing number of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and the bandwidth demand of future applications. Instead of using MOST for multimedia applications, there are some efforts of the automotive OEMs to introduce Ethernet for these applications. The legacy switched Ethernet network is not able to provide guaranteed Quality-of-Service (QoS) so that information can be delayed or lost in certain situations. With the introduction of the IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) specification, low latency multimedia streaming services with guaranteed QoS are possible in a switched Ethernet network. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of the Ethernet AVB standard for the use in a vehicle by comparing the performance to a prioritized network based on IEEE 802.1Q. We consider different invehicle applications and determine how the background load will influence these applications. Scope of the work is to reveal the benefits and weakness of Ethernet AVB compared to the legacy prioritization mechanism specified in IEEE 802.1Q.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268457","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Conference on Computing Technology and Information Management (NCM and ICNIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260079/6268457/06268460.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Conference on Computing Technology and Information Management (NCM and ICNIT)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268460","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local area networks","mobile radio","multimedia communication","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.1Q","IEEE 802.1 AVB","Ethernet-based in-vehicle network","advanced driver assistance systems","multimedia applications","MOST","automotive OEM","switched Ethernet network","quality-of-service","QoS","AudioNideo Bridging specification","Ethernet AVB standard","prioritization mechanism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of IEEE 802.1Q and IEEE 802.1 AVB in an Ethernet-based in-vehicle network","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2012","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12945066","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268460/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268460/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of IEEE 802.1Q and IEEE 802.1 AVB in an Ethernet-based in-vehicle network","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"001PaperICCM2012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045031S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260079","isNumber":"6268457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260079","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6268457","articleId":"6268460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6268493,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science Shaanxi Normal, University of Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Jing Yao","id":"38469097900"},{"name":"Ju-hou He","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science Shaanxi Normal, University of Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Ju-hou He","id":"38468489500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-88678-68-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0893-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6268493","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1072},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","optimisation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load balancing strategy","cloud computing","resource access","artificial bee colony algorithm","resource-intensive phenomenon","next served request","ABC algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","load balance","Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC)"]}],"abstract":"It is indispensable to cloud computing that implements resource access by load balancing. According to the characteristics and requirements of cloud computing environments, an artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) has been presented in this paper. Hundreds of thousand of simultaneous requests with the same type queued in the same server for the original ABC algorithm. Consequently, the local resource-intensive phenomenon arised and deteriorated load balancing. Due to the failure of this mechanism for the above case, an improved ABC is proposed. By replacing other types of requests with the next served request, the type of request is changed. It ended the accumulation of request and improved the system throughput.

One way information sharing where an instructor is the source of information is not suitable for them. A learning module that can simulate their interest and catch their attention is needed to ensure an effective learning session. Therefore this paper look into possibilities of adopting advance learning tools in enhancing education system for students with ADHD. The tools are believed to be able to spark their curiosity and grab their attention, which is the main challenge in educating students with ADHD. A study was conducted to see the teachers' opinion regarding the pros and cons of the adoption of these tools, whereas a second study was done to observe the students response. From the two studies conducted we are positive that the special education students, particularly students with ADHD, can also benefit from the application of advance learning tools. In addition to academic purpose, the students' social and problem solving skills can also be improved through adoption of these tools.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Educational institutions","Multimedia communication","Cloud computing","Courseware","Computers","Animation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","medical disorders","problem solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced learning tools","attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","ADHD","normal students","limited attention span","information sharing","learning module","learning session","advance learning tools","education system","students response","special education students","social skills","problem solving skills"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advance learning tools","attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)","special education"]}],"publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Conference on Computing Technology and Information Management (NCM and ICNIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Conference on Computing Technology and Information Management (NCM and ICNIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260079/6268557/06268606.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced learning tools for students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced learning tools for students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268606/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6268606/","accessionNumber":"12945207","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced learning tools for students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"144PaperICCM2012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074015S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260079","isNumber":"6268557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260079","xplore-issue":"6268557","articleId":"6268606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6268613,"authors":[{"name":"Li LiGang","affiliation":["School of Automation, University of Science & Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","College of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East), Dongying, China"],"lastName":"Li LiGang","id":"37564523400"},{"name":"Zhang ZhaoHui","affiliation":["School of Automation, University of Science & Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhang ZhaoHui","id":"37085389557"},{"name":"Dai YongShou","affiliation":["College of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East), Dongying, China"],"lastName":"Dai YongShou","id":"37856971900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-88678-68-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0893-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6268613","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Annealing","Vectors","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern search particle swarm optimizer","global optimization","multimodal functions","heuristic algorithm","intelligent algorithm","exploratory move","pattern move","optimization direction","local convergence","particle rebirth strategy","optimization variables diversity","searching space","optimization algorithm","premature convergence","optimization stagnancy","complex multimodal composition benchmark functions","stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pattern search particle swarm optimizer (PSPSO)","intelligent algorithm","multimodal function optimization","particle swarm optimizer (PSO)","global optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268613","abstract":"In order to solve the defects in the heuristic algorithm, the paper proposes an improved intelligent algorithm based on pattern search and particle swarm optimizer.

At the experiments of solving complex multi-modal composition benchmark functions, contrast with the heuristic algorithms, the stability and accuracy of the new algorithm are verified.","startPage":"815","endPage":"818","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Conference on Computing Technology and Information Management (NCM and ICNIT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268557","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Conference on Computing Technology and Information Management (NCM and ICNIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260079/6268557/06268613.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern search particle swarm optimizer for global optimization of multimodal functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268613/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pattern search particle swarm optimizer for global optimization of multimodal functions","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6268613/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12945213","publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern search particle swarm optimizer for global optimization of multimodal functions","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"151PaperICCM2012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070017S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260079","isNumber":"6268557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260079","xplore-issue":"6268557","articleId":"6268613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6268634,"authors":[{"name":"Xabier Iturbe","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Xabier","lastName":"Iturbe","id":"37397129000"},{"name":"Khaled Benkrid","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Benkrid","id":"37273494800"},{"name":"Raul Torrego","affiliation":["Embedded System-on-Chip Group, IK4 Research Alliance, Mondragon, Spain"],"firstName":"Raul","lastName":"Torrego","id":"37887682900"},{"name":"Ali Ebrahim","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ebrahim","id":"37886383000"},{"name":"Tughrul Arslan","affiliation":["System Level Integration Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Tughrul","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37273392000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1916-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1915-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1914-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6268634","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Synchronization","Reliability","Kernel","Latches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network routing","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online clock routing","reconfigurable system","regional clocking resources","Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA","reliability","regional clock buffer","BUFR","clock-tree on-the-fly","global clock multiplexer","regional clock multiplexer","GCMUX","RCMUX"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we report the design and implementation of a reconfigurable system that exploits regional clocking resources that exist in Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGAs for increased performance and, for the first time, enhanced reliability. Unlike previous approaches, our system is able to individually manage the regional clock buffers (BUFRs) to adjust the frequency delivered to each hardware task and to detect and recover from faults affecting the clock-tree on-the-fly. Towards this end, we propose global and regional clock multiplexers, named GCMUX and RCMUX respectively, which allow for switching to spare clocking resources whenever needed. These multiplexers are based on the inner programmable interconnection points of the FPGA, leading to zero area overheads.","publicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264152/6268630/06268634.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"91","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online clock routing in Xilinx FPGAs for high-performance and reliability","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2012.6268634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2012.6268634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Online clock routing in Xilinx FPGAs for high-performance and reliability","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12935800","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268634/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online clock routing in Xilinx FPGAs for high-performance and reliability","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063881S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264152","isNumber":"6268630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264152","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6268630","articleId":"6268634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6268636,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Gusev Lesau","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Victor Gusev","lastName":"Lesau","id":"38468694100"},{"name":"Edward Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Chen","id":"37932597900"},{"name":"William A.

This means that hardware logic can be swapped in and out on-the-fly while the rest of the system is operational. Since DPR is relatively new, tool support is still evolving. This paper introduces new FPGA architectural tools and Linux OS modifications that aid in supporting DPR on FPGAs for control. We emphasize that control systems benefit from real hardware concurrency, meaning that by moving the control intelligence into hardware we minimize the negative effects inherent to threads and their scheduler. This leaves software with the role of a high-level administrator rather than an executor, thus eliminating unnecessary bottlenecks. The developed tools enable the hardware engineer to develop DPR-FPGA systems more effectively for rapid control system development.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field

Specific temporal combinations of various events are often of special interest for automatic detection. For the description of such patterns, one can either implement rules in some higher programming language or use some Event Description Language (EDL). Both is complicated and error-prone for non-engineers, because it varies greatly from natural language. Therefore, we present a method, by which a domain expert can simply signal the occurrence of a significant incident at a specific point in time. The system then infers rules for automatically detecting such occurrences later on. At the core of our approach is an extension of hidden Markov models (HMM) called noise hidden Markov models (nHMM) that can be trained with existing, low-level event data. The nHMM can be applied online without any intervention of programming experts. An evaluation on both synthetic and real event data shows the efficiency of our approach even under the presence of highly frequent, insignificant events and uncertainty in the data.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2012.6268645","publicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264152/6268630/06268645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2012.6268645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268630","startPage":"159","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning event detection rules with noise hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning event detection rules with noise hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268645/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12935811","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268645/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning event detection rules with noise hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091892S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264152","isNumber":"6268630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264152","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6268630","articleId":"6268645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6268650,"authors":[{"name":"Varun Subramanian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Varun","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37400272000"},{"name":"Anurag Umbarkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Anurag","lastName":"Umbarkar","id":"37705430100"},{"name":"Alex Doboli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Doboli","id":"37272661500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1916-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1915-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1914-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6268650","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Optimization","Vectors","Distributed databases","Merging","Kinetic theory","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kinetic theory","resource allocation","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized detection","decentralized tracking","emergent kinetic data","wireless grids","embedded sensors","physical entities","cyber-physical systems","topography"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268650","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2012.6268650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2012.6268650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268630","publicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264152/6268630/06268650.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized detection and tracking of emergent kinetic data for wireless grids of embedded sensors","abstract":"The paper proposes methods to detect and track emergent kinetic data representing clouds of physical entities, e.g., clouds of polluting gas, or clusters of autonomous agents, like robots or vehicles. Kinetic data are important entities in Cyber-Physical Systems as they express phenomena that are distributed in space and time, and are dynamic with respect to their characteristic attributes and lifetime. The main attributes of kinetic data are topography (position, boundary, and area), nature (signature), and dynamics (up to n-th order gradients). The related operators define the distribution (discretization) and composition (aggregation) of the attributes. The paper presents fully decentralized methods for optimized implementation of kinetic data on a grid network of wireless embedded sensing nodes.

KNN is known to be robust and simple to implement when dealing with data of small size. However it performs slowly when data are large and have high dimensions. Therefore, KNN classifiers can benefit from the parallelism offered by Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate the algorithm. In addition, the KNN classifier is sensitive to the user defined parameter (K) which is the number of nearest neighbours. This parameter is known to affect the performance of the classifier; thus users would want the classifier to be easily adaptable to different values of K. In this work, we propose two adaptive FPGA architectures of the KNN classifier, and compare the implementations of each one of them with an equivalent implementation running on a general purpose processor (GPP). The proposed hardware implementations outperformed GPP by 76\u00d7 for the first architecture and 68\u00d7 for the second. In addition, we propose a novel dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) architecture of the KNN classifier, which allows for an efficient dynamic partial reconfiguration of a classifier implementation on FPGA for different K's. This DPR implementation offers 5\u00d7 speed-up in the reconfiguration time of a KNN classifier on FPGA.","publicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264152/6268630/06268651.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive implementation of a dynamically reconfigurable K-nearest neighbour classifier on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2012.6268651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2012.6268651","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive implementation of a dynamically reconfigurable K-nearest neighbour classifier on FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12935817","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268651/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive implementation of a dynamically reconfigurable K-nearest neighbour classifier on FPGA","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05723S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264152","isNumber":"6268630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264152","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6268630","articleId":"6268651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6268653,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Hofmann","affiliation":["RF and Microwave Design Department, Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"38468851800"},{"name":"Rainer Wansch","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Integrierte Schaltungen, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Wansch","id":"37303022100"},{"name":"Rob\u00e9rt Glein","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Integrierte Schaltungen, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Rob\u00e9rt","lastName":"Glein","id":"38468878400"},{"name":"Bernd Kollmannthaler","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-Institut fur Integrierte Schaltungen, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Kollmannthaler","id":"38468714600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1916-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1915-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1914-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6268653","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1019},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Field programmable gate arrays","Payloads","Satellite broadcasting","Digital video broadcasting","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace instrumentation","aperture antennas","application specific integrated circuits","artificial satellites","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based on-board processor platform","space application","antenna apertures","mobile devices","air-interface","on-board processing","satellite communication","ASIC","application specific integrated circuit","telecommunication satellite systems"]}],"abstract":"The increasing demand for higher data rates, smaller antenna apertures, or less power at the uplink for mobile devices requires air-interface and application specific processing, especially for telecommunication satellites. Only on satellites for dedicated applications or with a short limited lifetime, on-board processing is partly used, but processing on-board improves the system performance or increases the system capacity in several cases. Today's on-board processing for satellite communication is mostly based on ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), which have their main drawback in the limited flexibility. In order to demonstrate and validate the flexibility of an FPGA-based on-board processor (OBP) for space applications the Fraunhofer IIS is involved in a so-called in-orbit verification (IOV) payload on the H2Sat (Heinrich Hertz communication satellite) satellite. Potentially, an FPGA platform can be reconfigured for novel communication protocols. In order to investigate new standards for telecommunication satellite systems, the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS is developing an OBP platform, based on FPGAs, which will be embedded into the German research satellite H2Sat. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first completely reconfigurable platform based on four leadingedge radiation-hardened FPGAs in the geosynchronous orbit for telecommunication satellites.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2012.6268653","publicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264152/6268630/06268653.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2012.6268653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA based on-board processor platform for space application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268653/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA based on-board processor platform for space application","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6268653/","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12935819","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA based on-board processor platform for space application","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036039S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264152","isNumber":"6268630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264152","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6268630","articleId":"6268653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6268657,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Kai-feng","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR), National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Kai-feng","id":"38468486800"},{"name":"Tao Hua-min","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR), National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Hua-min","id":"38468330600"},{"name":"Xiao Shan-zhu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR), National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Shan-zhu","id":"38468328300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1916-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1915-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1914-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6268657","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel FPGA based virtual-PIG: Cell Matrix with embedded processor","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264152/6268630/06268657.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"245","publicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2012.6268657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268630","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2012.6268657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Microcontrollers","Shift registers","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel FPGA based virtual-PIG","cell matrix","embedded processor","bio-inspired hardware","fault-tolerance","VPIG","processing integrated grid","RISA","reconfigurable integrated system array","MCU","customizable instruction","self-replication feature","1-bit full adder evolution","2-bit counter","self-evolution feature","self-repair feature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268657","abstract":"Bio-inspired hardware has made great progress in the field of fault-tolerance during the past decades.

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) with large logic density provide a highly flexible platform to implement such sophisticated capabilities. Specifically, radiation tolerant space suitable SRAM-based FPGAs have significantly improved flexibility of high reliable systems for space applications and have already been proven in many space missions. Furthermore, the potential of SRAM-based FPGAs to support dynamic (partial) reconfiguration allows a flexible use of the available hardware (HW) platform in a TimeSpace Partitioning (TSP) manner. For the PHI Data Processing Unit (DPU), the seamless reconfigurability of these FPGAs enables multiple use of the FPGA resources during different modes of operation, i.e. one dedicated configuration for image acquisition and a different configuration for subsequent data processing. Other advantages like enhanced flexibility of a system or in-flight adaptation to changing mission requirements are presented. The basic structure proposed for the PHI DPU design is based on the results of the ESA study for a Dynamically Reconfigurable Processing Module (DRPM). The communication architecture employs our own SpaceWire based System-on-Chip Wire (SoCWire), which is able to connect reconfigurable modules to a host system with the capability to isolate these modules logically and physically. For safe in-flight update data integrity of the uploaded HW code must be guaranteed from ground upload until storage in configuration memory to maintain system qualification. This is taken into account especially in view of possible Single Event Upsets (SEUs) errors in configuration memory. A reasonable separation of the required functional modules in different configurations for the FPGAs is shown. The necessary reconfiguration of the FPGAs has no operational impact. Finally, a comparative summary of needed resources clearly outlines the advantages of a dynamically reconfigurable configuration, resulting in mission cost reduction.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2012.6268666","publicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264152/6268630/06268666.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2012.6268666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive hardware by dynamic reconfiguration for the Solar Orbiter PHI instrument","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268666/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive hardware by dynamic reconfiguration for the Solar Orbiter PHI instrument","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12935832","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6268666/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive hardware by dynamic reconfiguration for the Solar Orbiter PHI instrument","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050925S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264152","isNumber":"6268630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264152","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6268630","articleId":"6268666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6268667,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Bauer","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37411983400"},{"name":"Claus Braun","affiliation":["ITI, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Claus","lastName":"Braun","id":"37532374200"},{"name":"Michael E.

In this paper we will first introduce the novel ranging signals for higher time delay estimation, then develop the corresponding detection algorithm namely Regularized Compressive Sampling Mathing Pursuit (RCoSaMP), which outperforms the most conventional detection approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268738/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12935767","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Indoor ranging signal recovery via regularized CoSaMP","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor ranging signal recovery via regularized CoSaMP","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051991S","chronDate":"15-16 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261642","isNumber":"6268724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261642","xplore-issue":"6268724","articleId":"6268738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6268746,"authors":[{"name":"Troels Laursen","affiliation":["Section for Networking and Security, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Troels","lastName":"Laursen","id":"38468533100"},{"name":"Nikolaj Bisgaard Pedersen","affiliation":["Section for Networking and Security, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Nikolaj Bisgaard","lastName":"Pedersen","id":"38468987500"},{"name":"Jimmy Jessen Nielsen","affiliation":["Section for Networking and Security, Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jimmy Jessen","lastName":"Nielsen","id":"37406865900"},{"name":"Tatiana K.

Conventional indoor localization systems do usually not take these properties of the user's movements into account. In this paper we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based tracking algorithm, which takes a user's previous movements into account. In a quantized grid representation of an indoor scenario, past movement information is used to update the HMM transition probabilities. The user's most likely trajectory is then calculated using and extended version of the Viterbi algorithm. The results show significant improvements of the proposed algorithm compared to a simpler moving average smoothing.","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2012.6268746","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261642/6268724/06268746.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2012.6268746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov Model based mobility learning fo improving indoor tracking of mobile users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268746/","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov Model based mobility learning fo improving indoor tracking of mobile users","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12935775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6268746/","conferenceDate":"15-16 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov Model based mobility learning fo improving indoor tracking of mobile users","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072708S","chronDate":"15-16 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261642","isNumber":"6268724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261642","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6268724","articleId":"6268746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6268748,"authors":[{"name":"Marios Raspopoulos","affiliation":["Sigint Solutions Limited, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Raspopoulos","id":"37688921100"},{"name":"Christos Laoudias","affiliation":["KIOS Research Center for Intelligent Systems and Networks Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Laoudias","id":"37393147100"},{"name":"Loizos Kanaris","affiliation":["Sigint Solutions Limited, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Loizos","lastName":"Kanaris","id":"38468466800"},{"name":"Akis Kokkinis","affiliation":["Sigint Solutions Limited, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Akis","lastName":"Kokkinis","id":"37937953500"},{"name":"Christos G.

RSS data collection might be a tedious and time-consuming process and also the measured radiomap accuracy and applicability is subject to potential changes in the wireless environment. Therefore, RT becomes a more attractive and efficient way to generate radiomaps. Moreover, traditional fingerprint-based methods lead to radiomaps which are restricted to the device used to generate the radiomap and fail to provide acceptable performance when different devices are considered. We address both challenges by exploiting 3D RT-generated radiomaps and using linear data transformation to match the characteristics of various devices. We evaluate the efficiency of this approach in terms of the time spent to create the radiomap, the amount of data required to calibrate the radiomap for different devices and the positioning error which is compared against the case of using dedicated radiomaps collected with each device.","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2012.6268748","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261642/6268724/06268748.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2012.6268748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Ray Tracing for device-independent fingerprint-based positioning in WLANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268748/","displayDocTitle":"3D Ray Tracing for device-independent fingerprint-based positioning in WLANs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12935777","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6268748/","conferenceDate":"15-16 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Ray Tracing for device-independent fingerprint-based positioning in WLANs","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070213S","chronDate":"15-16 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261642","isNumber":"6268724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261642","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6268724","articleId":"6268748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6268766,"authors":[{"name":"Avraham Freedman","affiliation":["Nice Systems Limited, Ra'anana, Israel"],"firstName":"Avraham","lastName":"Freedman","id":"37272929900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1439-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1437-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1438-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6268766","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Estimation","Ray tracing","Mobile communication","Noise level","Equations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Doppler effect","error analysis","geographic information systems","multipath channels","position measurement","ray tracing","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["velocity estimation","urban environment","ray tracing","mobile cellular terminal","urban multipath-rich environment","geographical information","propagation environment","Doppler processing","signal receiving","single antenna","error analysis","geographical databases","network databases","measurement accuracy","location accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Position measurement","Doppler Processing","ray tracing","Rayleigh channels","multipath channels","pattern matching","geographic information system"]}],"abstract":"The paper discusses the problem of estimating the velocity of a mobile cellular terminal within an urban, multipath-rich environment, using available geographical information such as terrain and building maps.

The hardware realization of neural network requires investigation of many design issues relating to signal interfacing and design of a single neuron. Analysis focuses on effect of digital design decisions such as module architecture towards data accuracy and delay. The work touches on analogue to digital interfacing, data structure and digital module design that includes adder, multiplier and multiplier accumulator (MAC). A major component of the algorithm is the design of the activation function. The chosen activation function is the hyperbolic tangent which is approximated by Taylor Series expansion. The neuron is evaluated on an Altera DE2-70 FPGA. The performances are evaluated in terms of functionality, usage of resources and timing analysis. For the data structure, it was demonstrated that increasing the fractional bits will increases the precision. The neuron functionality was demonstrated on digital platform. It was found that less delay were produce by using Carry Look Ahead design compared to Ripple Carry Adder by 25% in the MAC performance.","doi":"10.1109/SHUSER.2012.6268815","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260078/6268769/06268815.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Symposium on Humanities, Science and Engineering Research","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Symposium on Humanities, Science and Engineering Research","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SHUSER.2012.6268815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of single neuron on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design of single neuron on FPGA","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12935512","publicationDate":"June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6268815/","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of single neuron on FPGA","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p133mohamad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041676S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260078","isNumber":"6268769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260078","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6268769","articleId":"6268815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6268818,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Salwa Shafie","affiliation":["Faculity of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ana Salwa","lastName":"Shafie","id":"38468743300"},{"name":"Itaza Afiani Mohtar","affiliation":["Faculity of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Itaza Afiani","lastName":"Mohtar","id":"38468979300"},{"name":"Suraya Masrom","affiliation":["Faculity of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Suraya","lastName":"Masrom","id":"37542523600"},{"name":"Normah Ahmad","affiliation":["Faculity of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Normah","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"38468425500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1310-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1311-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1309-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-9808"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-9816"}],"articleNumber":"6268818","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","convergence","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation neural network","error function","classification problem","multilayer perceptron","BP","convergence rate","learning rate","momentum term","activation function slope","arctangent function","sigmoid logistic function","hidden-to-output layer","input-to-hidden layer","XOR","Balloon"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["backpropagation algorithm","error function","activation function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6268818","abstract":"Neural network has been used extensively for classification and many real world applications. The most commonly used neural network is multilayer perceptron with backpropagation (BP) algorithm. However the major problem of this algorithm is slow convergence rate and trap to local minima. The convergence is dependent on network parameters such as learning rate, momentum term and slope of activation function as well as its error function. This study proposes a New Improved BP algorithm which applies adaptive activation function using arctangent function in input-to-hidden layer and sigmoid logistic function in hidden-to-output layer. The efficiency and accuracy of the new improved method have been implemented and tested on two benchmark datasets: XOR and Balloon. The results show that the proposed method improved the convergence speed.

The objective is to control the TRMS response in order to obey the desired output and rejecting external disturbances. To control the TRMS was challenging since the rotor interact badly at the beam between yaw and pitch. For this reason, it considers as multi input and multi output (MIMO) with nonlinear behavior. The new approach using PID-AFC integrate with neural network and fuzzy logic was proposed to compensate the disturbance occur on TRMS. AFC scheme refer as based controller was used to estimate the disturbance torque while neural network and fuzzy logic act as an optimization device. In initial stage PID-AFC can still be used in minimize the tracking error and rejecting the disturbances.

The proposed technique PSO-CFIWA in close similarity with Real coded Genetic Algorithm (RGA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) performs a structured randomized search of an unknown parameter within a multidimensional search space by manipulating a swarm of particles to converge to an optimal solution. PSO being a population based stochastic search method tries to maintain a proper balance between global and local search for achieving the optimum result. The exploration and exploitation of entire search space can be handled efficiently with the proposed technique PSO-CFIWA along with the benefits of overcoming the premature convergence and stagnation problems.

A comparison of simulation results reveals the optimization efficacy of the algorithm over the prevailing optimization techniques for the solution of the multimodal, non-differentiable, highly non-linear, and constrained FIR filter design problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6268874/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12935565","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6268874/","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Novel particle swarm optimization for high pass FIR filter design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel particle swarm optimization for high pass FIR filter design","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p413mandal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089521S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260078","isNumber":"6268769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260078","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6268769","articleId":"6268874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6268910,"authors":[{"name":"Dragana Prokin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Professional Studies, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dragana","lastName":"Prokin","id":"37398574300"},{"name":"Milan Prokin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Prokin","id":"37332275900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9940-9436-0-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2366-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-5475"}],"articleNumber":"6268910","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"abstract":"The presented lowest complexity adaptive bit-pipeline rank filter (LCABP) reduces the complexity of specialized processing hardware, due to similar pipeline stages and the complete absence of masking bits in comparison with other solutions.

Determining when it is best to reallocate VMs from an overloaded host is an aspect of dynamic VM consolidation that directly influences the resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) delivered by the system. The influence on the QoS is explained by the fact that server overloads cause resource shortages and performance degradation of applications. Current solutions to the problem of host overload detection are generally heuristic based, or rely on statistical analysis of historical data. The limitations of these approaches are that they lead to suboptimal results and do not allow explicit specification of a QoS goal. We propose a novel approach that for any known stationary workload and a given state configuration optimally solves the problem of host overload detection by maximizing the mean intermigration time under the specified QoS goal based on a Markov chain model. We heuristically adapt the algorithm to handle unknown nonstationary workloads using the Multisize Sliding Window workload estimation technique. Through simulations with workload traces from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs, we show that our approach outperforms the best benchmark algorithm and provides approximately 88 percent of the performance of the optimal offline algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing Overloaded Hosts for Dynamic Consolidation of Virtual Machines in Cloud Data Centers under Quality of Service

In order to overcome this difficulty, the fiber is tapered by hydrofluoric (HF) acid and the surface of the tapered region is exposed to HF acid vapor. The acid vapor creates fine holes and scratches on the fiber surface. A low refractive index polymer is then used to recoat the fiber surface, which extracts the unwanted cladding light from the fiber over a relatively large area. This eliminates the abrupt removal of light and consequently the detrimental thermal effects due to localized heating. The power-handling capability of the device is tested under 90 W of cladding light, and attenuation of 16.7 dB is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2213295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2213295","startPage":"3199","endPage":"3202","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6313970/06269035.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method for Stripping Cladding Lights in High Power Fiber Lasers and Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Stripping Cladding Lights in High Power Fiber Lasers and Amplifiers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","volume":"30","issue":"20","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6269035/","accessionNumber":"13014875","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269035/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Stripping Cladding Lights in High Power Fiber Lasers and Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jlt-norouzy-2213295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087901S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6313970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6313970","articleId":"6269035","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6269043,"authors":[{"name":"Byeongkwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeongkwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37534752400"},{"name":"Yongsoo Park","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongsoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37540023400"},{"name":"Hyunho Wi","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunho","lastName":"Wi","id":"37950806300"},{"name":"Myun-Joo Park","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myun-Joo","lastName":"Park","id":"37276966600"},{"name":"Yonggyu Choi","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yonggyu","lastName":"Choi","id":"38238562900"},{"name":"Jeongkwan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongkwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"38241582900"},{"name":"Woojae Jung","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woojae","lastName":"Jung","id":"37551519500"},{"name":"Daewoong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daewoong","lastName":"Kim","id":"38255066500"},{"name":"Byungje Lee","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byungje","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281108800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6269043","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1665},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Universal Serial Bus","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isolation enhancement","USB dongle MIMO antenna","LTE 700 band applications","multiple input multiple output antenna","Long Term Evolution","symmetrical meander radiator","frequency 704 MHz to 746 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Enveloped correlation coefficient (ECC)","isolation","Long Term Evolution (LTE)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) antenna","mutual coupling","USB dongle"]}],"abstract":"A compact USB dongle multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna for Long Term Evolution (LTE) 700 band (704 ~ 746 MHz) applications is proposed.

Since the best discriminative features for airport runways cannot be trivially predicted, the Adaboost algorithm is employed as a feature selector over a large set of features. Moreover, the selected features with corresponding weights can provide information on the hidden characteristics of runways. Thus, the Adaboost-based selected feature subset can be used for both detecting runways and identifying their textural characteristics. Thus, a coarse representation of possible runway locations is obtained.

For real-time consideration, the beamformer was formulated into state-space observer form and the second-order extended (SOE) Kalman filter was derived. However, the SOE Kalman filter assumes an accurate system dynamic and statistics of the noise signals. These assumptions limit the performance under uncertainties.

Many musical pieces are characterized by an underlying repeating structure over which varying elements are superimposed. This is especially true for pop songs where a singer often overlays varying vocals on a repeating accompaniment. On this basis, we present the REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET), a novel and simple approach for separating the repeating \u201cbackground\u201d from the non-repeating \u201cforeground\u201d in a mixture. The basic idea is to identify the periodically repeating segments in the audio, compare them to a repeating segment model derived from them, and extract the repeating patterns via time-frequency masking. Experiments on data sets of 1,000 song clips and 14 full-track real-world songs showed that this method can be successfully applied for music/voice separation, competing with two recent state-of-the-art approaches. Further experiments showed that REPET can also be used as a preprocessor to pitch detection algorithms to improve melody extraction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET): A Simple Method for Music/Voice Separation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2012.2213249","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6334458/06269059.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2012.2213249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6334458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET): A Simple Method for Music/Voice Separation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6269059/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13061953","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET): A Simple Method for Music/Voice Separation","sourcePdf":"tasl-rafii-2213249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069635S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6334458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"6334458","articleId":"6269059","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269064,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Taghavi","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6331616/6269064/6269064-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamidreza Taghavi (S\u201909) received the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree on the novel Bone Conduction Implant system.","His research interests include hearing implants, bone anchored hearing aids, bone conduction hearing implants, low-power integrated circuit design for implantable medical devices, biomedical instrumentations, and integrated radio frequency circuits."]},"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Taghavi","id":"38489855000"},{"name":"Bo Hkansson","affiliation":["Chalmers tekniska hogskola, Goteborg, SE"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6331616/6269064/6269064-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Bo H\u00e5kansson received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1977, where he also received the Ph.D. degree in 1984 by defending the thesis with title The Bone Anchored Hearing Aid- Engineering Aspects in the Department of Applied Electronics.","He is currently a Professor of biomedical engineering and Head of the Biomedical Signals and Systems Research Group in the Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology.

Patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss and single-sided deafness can be rehabilitated by bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA). Whereas the conventional hearing aids transmit sound to the tympanic membrane via air conduction, the BAHA transmits sound via vibrations through the skull directly to the cochlea. It uses a titanium screw that penetrates the skin and needs life-long daily care; it may cause skin infection and redness. The BCI is developed as an alternative to the percutaneous BAHA since it leaves the skin intact. The BCI comprises an external audio processor with a transmitter coil and an implanted unit called the bridging bone conductor with a receiver coil. Using amplitude modulation of the Class-E power amplifier that drives the inductive link, the sound signal is transmitted to the implant through the intact skin. It was found that the BCI can generate enough output force level for candidate patients. Maximum power output of the BCI was designed to occur at 5-mm skin thickness and the variability was within 1.5\u00a0dB for 1\u20138-mm skin thickness variations.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2213252","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6331616/06269064.pdf","startPage":"3050","endPage":"3059","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2213252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of RF Power and Data Link Using Amplitude Modulation of Class-E for a Novel Bone Conduction Implant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of RF Power and Data Link Using Amplitude Modulation of Class-E for a Novel Bone Conduction Implant","volume":"59","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13055188","pubMedId":"22907959","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6269064/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of RF Power and Data Link Using Amplitude Modulation of Class-E for a Novel Bone Conduction Implant","sourcePdf":"tbme-pt1-taghavi-2213252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100364S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6331616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6331616","articleId":"6269064","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6269067,"authors":[{"name":"Can Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, PA, USA","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Department of Computer Science Faculty of Science, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6303890/6269067/6269067-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Can Ye (S'10) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from the Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2008.

The new sensing metric shows higher immunity against variations of the nanogap length, compared with the commonly used metric that relies on threshold voltage or drain current. The proposed metric also shows smaller fluctuation, which is caused by environmental variation coming from biotreatment steps. This analysis is verified experimentally and proved by device simulations. For simple analysis, the effect of external charge of the biomolecules is eliminated by using peptide nucleic acid, which is an electrically neutral biomolecule. Thus, by using such biomolecules, the permittivity effect rising from the biomolecules within the nanogap of the gate dielectric is investigated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2012.2209650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305505","startPage":"2825","endPage":"2831","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6305505/06269073.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Sensing Metric to Reduce Data Fluctuations in a Nanogap-Embedded Field-Effect Transistor Biosensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6269073/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Sensing Metric to Reduce Data Fluctuations in a Nanogap-Embedded Field-Effect Transistor Biosensor","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12998893","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Sensing Metric to Reduce Data Fluctuations in a Nanogap-Embedded Field-Effect Transistor Biosensor","sourcePdf":"ted-kim-2209650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080479S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6305505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6305505","articleId":"6269073","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6269075,"authors":[{"name":"Kaixue Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6334462/6269075/6269075-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaixue Ma (M\u201905\u2013SM\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.","Since 2010, he has been a Senior Research Fellow and the Technique Team Leader for 60-GHz SOC chipset research and development with NTU."]},"firstName":"Kaixue","lastName":"Ma","id":"37289937100"},{"name":"Shouxian Mou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6334462/6269075/6269075-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Shouxian Mou received the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2007.","Currently, he is a Research Fellow with the VIRTUS-IC Design Centre of Excellence, NTU, working on 60-GHz wireless transceiver chip development."]},"firstName":"Shouxian","lastName":"Mou","id":"37329892100"},{"name":"Kiat Seng Yeo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6334462/6269075/6269075-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Kiat Seng Yeo (SM\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.","He is an Associate Chair (Research) and the Founding Director of VIRTUS, a S$50M IC Design Centre of Excellence, NTU."]},"firstName":"Kiat Seng","lastName":"Yeo","id":"37277042100"},{"name":"Wei Meng Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6334462/6269075/6269075-photo-4-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Meng Lim received the M.E degree from Nanyang Technology University (NTU), Singapore in 2002 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently a Research Staff with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, NTU."]},"firstName":"Wei Meng","lastName":"Lim","id":"37599560200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6269075","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":625},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"A low-pass filter (LPF) with ultrawide rejection band and compact size by using a cross-coupled topology is proposed.

The proposed MA achieves this by incorporating various novel features: 1) a modified fitness function includes two additional terms to account for the hydrophobic and polar nature of the residues; 2) a systematic (rather than random) generation of population automatically prevents an occurrence of invalid conformations; 3) a generalized nonisomorphic encoding scheme implicitly eliminates generation of twins (similar conformations) in the population; 4) the identification of a meme (protein substructures) during optimization from different basins of attraction - a process that is equivalent to implicit applications of threading principles; 5) a clustering of the population corresponds to basins of attraction that allows evolution to overcome the complexity of multimodal search space, thereby avoiding search getting trapped in a local optimum; and 6) a 2-stage framework gathers domain knowledge (i.e., substructures or memes) from different basins of attraction for a combined execution in the second stage. Experiments conducted with different lattice models using known benchmark protein sequences and comparisons carried out with recently reported approaches in this journal show that the proposed algorithm has robustness, speed, accuracy, and superior performance. The approach is generic and can easily be extended for applications to other classes of problems.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2012.2213258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6570514/06269078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2012.2213258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6570514","startPage":"558","endPage":"576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustered Memetic Algorithm With Local Heuristics for Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clustered Memetic Algorithm With Local Heuristics for Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13692781","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6269078/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustered Memetic Algorithm With Local Heuristics for Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction","sourcePdf":"tevc-islam-2213258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153276S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6570514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6570514","articleId":"6269078","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6269079,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhou","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems and Biomedical Robotics Group, School of Creative Technologies, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK","School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6488749/6269079/6269079-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Zhou received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

The stochastic nonlinear system addressed in this paper is assumed to possess unstructured uncertainties (unknown nonlinear functions) and, in the presence of unmodeled dynamics, dynamics disturbances. Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unstructured uncertainties, and a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states. By combining the backstepping design technique with the stochastic small-gain approach, a new adaptive fuzzy output feedback control approach is developed. It is proved that the proposed control approach can guarantee that the closed-loop system is input-state-practically stability (ISpS) in probability, and the observer errors and the output of the system converge to a small neighborhood of the origin by appropriate choice of the design parameters. Simulation results are included to indicate that the proposed adaptive fuzzy control approach has a satisfactory control performance. In addition, the simulation comparisons with the previous methods show that the proposed adaptive fuzzy control approach has robustness to the dynamical uncertainties.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6488749/06269080.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2213260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2213260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6488749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combined Backstepping and Stochastic Small-Gain Approach to Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backstepping","Adaptive systems","Nonlinear systems","Uncertainty","Observers","Output feedback","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","fuzzy control","nonlinear control systems","observers","probability","robust control","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic small-gain approach","robust adaptive fuzzy output feedback control","stochastic nonlinear strict-feedback system","state measurement requirement","nonlinear function","unmodeled dynamics","fuzzy logic system","fuzzy state observer design","state estimation","backstepping design technique","closed-loop system","input-state-practically stability","probability","observer error","design parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy adaptive backstepping control","fuzzy logic systems (FLSs)","small-gain theorem","stochastic nonlinear systems","unmodeled dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Combined Backstepping and Stochastic Small-Gain Approach to Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Control","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6269080/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13401168","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combined Backstepping and Stochastic Small-Gain Approach to Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Output Feedback Control","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-tong-2213260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134057S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6488749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"6488749","articleId":"6269080","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6269084,"authors":[{"name":"William Matthews","affiliation":["Statistical Laboratory, Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"p":["William Matthews received B.A. and M.Sci. degrees in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K. in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from Bristol University (under the supervision of Prof. Andreas Winter) in 2009.

Here response sharpening with a Chebyshev polynomial, using a previously reported CIC variant, separates each such multiple zero into an equiripple stopband. By trading unneeded depth at stopband center for improved depth at the stopband edge, the latter depth improves by some 6(N-1) dB in an Nth-order system. Increased computational complexity is modest: a few low-speed additions and multiplications by small integer coefficients that can often be chosen as powers of two. Alternatively, parameters can be configured to replace the many small stopbands with one large one, and this is demonstrated here with example spatial-processing CIC designs that create pencil beams for 1D and 2D receive antenna arrays.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6359940/06269091.pdf","startPage":"2956","endPage":"2968","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chebyshev Stopbands for CIC Decimation Filters and CIC-Implemented Array Tapers in 1D and 2D","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Chebyshev Stopbands for CIC Decimation Filters and CIC-Implemented Array Tapers in 1D and 2D","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6269091/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13146666","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chebyshev Stopbands for CIC Decimation Filters and CIC-Implemented Array Tapers in 1D and 2D","sourcePdf":"tcsi-coleman-2206435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119364S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6359940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6359940","articleId":"6269091","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":6269093,"authors":[{"name":"Kwok-Keung M.

The approach has been tested on a large (16 machine, 68 bus) test network incorporating parallel HVDC/AC transmission and has shown improved damping compared to a traditional Power System Stabilizer (PSS) based controller structure utilizing local signals. The design process has incorporated the effects of wide area signal transmission delays. Variation in these signal delays and the complete loss of signals has been also investigated to establish the robustness of the WAMS based controller and its sensitivity to loss of signals. Extension of the controller to incorporate reactive power modulation has been investigated, as has variation in available active power modulation capacity.

First, for locomotion, the robot strides by bending its body into an omega shape; anisotropic friction pads enable the robot to move forward using this simple motion. Second, the robot body is made of a single part but has two four-bar mechanisms and one spherical six-bar mechanism; the mechanisms are 2-D patterned into a single piece of composite and folded to become a robot body that weighs less than 1 g and that can crawl and steer. This design does not require the assembly of various mechanisms of the body structure, thereby simplifying the fabrication process. Third, a new concept for using a shape-memory alloy (SMA) coil-spring actuator is proposed; the coil spring is designed to have a large spring index and to work over a large pitch-angle range. This large-index-and-pitch SMA spring actuator cools faster and requires less energy, without compromising the amount of force and displacement that it can produce. Therefore, the frequency and the efficiency of the actuator are improved. A prototype was used to demonstrate that the inchworm-inspired, novel, small-scale, lightweight robot manufactured on a single piece of composite can crawl and steer.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2012.2211033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2012.2211033","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6410053/06269102.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omega-Shaped Inchworm-Inspired Crawling Robot With Large-Index-and-Pitch (LIP) SMA Spring Actuators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Omega-Shaped Inchworm-Inspired Crawling Robot With Large-Index-and-Pitch (LIP) SMA Spring Actuators","volume":"18","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13219925","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6269102/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Omega-Shaped Inchworm-Inspired Crawling Robot With Large-Index-and-Pitch (LIP) SMA Spring Actuators","sourcePdf":"tmech-cho-2211033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0665S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6410053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6410053","articleId":"6269102","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6269103,"authors":[{"name":"Jienan Ding","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics and Mechanism Applications Laboratory, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6557441/6269103/6269103-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jienan Ding (M\u201909) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in mechatronics from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2002, 2004, and 2008, respectively.","From 2008 to 2010, he was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University, New York, NY.

The IREP can be inserted through a \u00d815 mm trocar into the abdomen and it uses 21 actuated joints for controlling two dexterous arms and a stereo-vision module. Each dexterous arm has a hybrid mechanical architecture comprised of a two-segment continuum robot, a parallelogram mechanism for improved dual-arm triangulation, and a distal wrist for improved dexterity during suturing. The IREP is unique because of the combination of continuum arms with active and passive segments with rigid parallel kinematics mechanisms. This paper presents the clinical motivation, design considerations, kinematics, statics, and mechanical design of the IREP. The kinematics of coordination between the parallelogram mechanisms and the continuum arms is presented using the pseudo-rigid-body model of the beam representing the passive segment of each snake arm. Kinematic and static simulations and preliminary experiment results are presented in support of our design choices.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2012.2209671","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6557441/06269103.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2012.2209671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6557441","startPage":"1612","endPage":"1624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Coordination Kinematics of an Insertable Robotic Effectors Platform for Single-Port Access Surgery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Coordination Kinematics of an Insertable Robotic Effectors Platform for Single-Port Access Surgery","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13730794","pubMedId":"23963105","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6269103/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Coordination Kinematics of an Insertable Robotic Effectors Platform for Single-Port Access Surgery","sourcePdf":"tmech-simaan-2209671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090186S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6557441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6557441","articleId":"6269103","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6269105,"authors":[{"name":"Thuan Q.

However, the production of relatively large and opaque weight matrices during learning has inspired substantial research on how to extract symbolic human-readable interpretations from trained networks. Unlike feedforward networks, where research has focused mainly on rule extraction, most past work with recurrent networks has viewed them as dynamical systems that can be approximated symbolically by finite-state machine (FSMs). With this approach, the network's hidden layer activation space is typically divided into a finite number of regions. Past research has mainly focused on better techniques for dividing up this activation space. In contrast, very little work has tried to influence the network training process to produce a better representation in hidden layer activation space, and that which has been done has had only limited success. Here we propose a powerful general technique to bias the error backpropagation training process so that it learns an activation space representation from which it is easier to extract FSMs. Using four publicly available data sets that are based on regular and context-free languages, we show via computational experiments that the modified learning method helps to extract FSMs with substantially fewer states and less variance than unmodified backpropagation learning, without decreasing the neural networks' accuracy. We conclude that modifying error backpropagation so that it more effectively separates learned pattern encodings in the hidden layer is an effective way to improve contemporary FSM extraction methods.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2210242","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6298049/06269105.pdf","startPage":"1649","endPage":"1658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2210242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6298049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbolic Representation of Recurrent Neural Network Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic Representation of Recurrent Neural Network Dynamics","volume":"23","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2012","accessionNumber":"12982124","pubMedId":"24808009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6269105/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic Representation of Recurrent Neural Network Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tnnls-huynh-2210242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095938S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6298049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6298049","articleId":"6269105","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269108,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6341145/6269108/6269108-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-Ming (Orion) Chen was born in Tainan, Taiwan.

This converter can operate under high power conversion efficiency because the symmetric LLC resonant network has zero-voltage switching capability for primary power switches and soft commutation capability for output rectifiers. In addition, the proposed topology does not require any snubber circuits to reduce the voltage stress of the switching devices because the switch voltage of the primary and secondary power stage is confined by the input and output voltage, respectively. In addition, the power conversion efficiency of any directions is exactly same as each other. Using digital control schemes, a 5-kW prototype converter designed for a high-frequency galvanic isolation of 380-V dc buses was developed with a commercial digital signal processor. Intelligent digital control algorithms are also proposed to regulate output voltage and to control bidirectional power conversions. Using the prototype converter, experimental results were obtained to verify the performance of the proposed topology and control algorithms. The converter could softly change the power flow directions and its maximum power conversion efficiency was 97.8% during the bidirectional operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","volume":"28","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2012","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6269109/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design Methodology of Bidirectional CLLC Resonant Converter for High-Frequency Isolation of DC Distribution Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Methodology of Bidirectional CLLC Resonant Converter for High-Frequency Isolation of DC Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-jung-2213346-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092159S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6341145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"266","xplore-issue":"6341145","articleId":"6269109","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6269110,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Sung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6341145/6269110/6269110-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ho-Sung Kim (M'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Pusan National University, Pusan, Korea, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Since 2007, he has been working as a Researcher in the Power Conversion and Control Research Center, HVDC Research Division, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, Korea.

To reduce the switches\u2019 losses of the proposed nonisolated full-bridge ac\u2013dc rectifier using an unipolar switching method, switching devices employ insulated-gate bipolar transistors, MOSFETs, and silicon carbide diodes. Using the analysis of the rectifier\u2019s operating modes, each switching device can be selected by considering switch stresses. A simple and intuitive frequency detection method for a single-phase synchronous reference frame-phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) is also proposed using a filter compensator, a fast period detector, and a finite impulse response filter to improve the robustness and accuracy of PLL performance under fundamental frequency variations. In addition, design and control methodology of the bidirectional full-bridge CLLC resonant converter is suggested for the galvanic isolation of the dc distribution system. A dead-band control algorithm for the bidirectional dc\u2013dc converter is developed to smoothly change power conversion directions only using output voltage information.

The impedance interaction between individually designed converters may make the cascaded system unstable. The previous presented approaches of stabilizing the cascaded systems need to modify the source and/or load converter's internal structure such as the topology and control circuit that are contradictory to the modularization characteristic of dc DPS. In this paper, an adaptive active capacitor converter (AACC) is introduced to stabilize the cascaded system. The AACC is connected in parallel with the cascaded system's intermediate bus and only needs to detect the bus voltage without any change of the existing subsystems. Hence, it can be designed as a standard module for dc DPS. The AACC serves as an equivalent bus capacitor to reduce the output impedance of the source converter, thus avoiding the intersection with the load converter's input impedance, and as a result, the cascaded system becomes stable. The equivalent bus capacitor emulated by the AACC is adaptive according to the output power of the cascaded system, and thus, the power loss of AACC is minimized and the dynamic response of the system is better than that of the system using a passive capacitor. Furthermore, since no electrolytic capacitor is needed in the AACC, the cascaded system's lifetime is prolonged. The operation principle, control, and design consideration of the AACC are discussed in this paper, and a 480 W cascaded system comprising two phase-shifted full-bridge converters has been built and evaluated. The experimental results verify the validity of the proposed AACC.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6341145/06269113.pdf","startPage":"1807","endPage":"1816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2213268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2213268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Active Capacitor Converter for Improving Stability of Cascaded DC Power Supply System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Impedance","Inductors","Adaptive systems","Frequency conversion","Oscillators","Power system stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active capacitor converter","adaptive control","cascaded system","modularization","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Active Capacitor Converter for Improving Stability of Cascaded DC Power Supply System","volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6269113/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Active Capacitor Converter for Improving Stability of Cascaded DC Power Supply System","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2213268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110848S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6341145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"6341145","articleId":"6269113","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269117,"authors":[{"name":"Brendan Mumey","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6353156/6269117/6269117-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brendan Mumey (M'07) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 1990, the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 1992, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1997.","In 2011, he was a Visiting Fulbright Distinguished Chair with Aalto University, Aalto, Finland.

This ability can improve the overall network performance but introduces the question of how to best use the channels. This paper first considers the problem of selecting the channels to use given a routing path such that the end-to-end throughput along the path is maximized. We show that a dynamic programming-based approach can optimally solve the problem and, if the path satisfies a natural condition, in time, be linear in the length (hop count) of the path. In addition, the algorithm can easily be implemented in a distributed fashion. We also examine the harder joint problem of finding the best routing path and channel selection that maximizes the end-to-end throughput. We prove that obtaining a (2/3 + \u03b5) approximation to the joint problem is NP-hard. We then present a heuristic algorithm for the joint problem and a second heuristic channel-aware routing-only algorithm.

This paper investigates a torque distribution scheme for a front- and rear-wheel-driven microsized EV to improve drive train efficiency over a wide torque and speed range. The loss model of the traction permanent-magnet (PM) motor is characterized in both the constant-torque and flux-weakening regions. The relationship between motor efficiency and torque at a given speed is then derived. It has been shown that maximum efficiency is achieved if the total torque required by the vehicle is equally shared between the two identical motors. In addition, the distribution of the energy consumption over a New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) is analyzed, and the regions of high speed and low torque are identified to have a high level of energy consumption; in these regions, motor efficiency improvement is the most important. Therefore, this paper further proposes to operate just one motor to provide the total required torque in the low-torque region. A clutch may be employed between one motor and gearbox (differential), thus \u201cswitching off\u201d its idle loss (no-load loss and flux-weakening loss) and improving drive train efficiency. An online optimized torque distribution algorithm has been devised based on the motor efficiency map to determine whether the second motor should be disengaged by the clutch in the low-torque region. With the proposed optimization scheme, drive train efficiency can be improved by 4% over the NEDC. Experimental test results validate the proposed torque distribution strategy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque Distribution Strategy for a Front- and Rear-Wheel-Driven Electric Vehicle","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2213282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6330019/06269119.pdf","startPage":"3365","endPage":"3374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2213282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6330019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Torque Distribution Strategy for a Front- and Rear-Wheel-Driven Electric Vehicle","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6269119/","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038919","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque Distribution Strategy for a Front- and Rear-Wheel-Driven Electric Vehicle","sourcePdf":"tvt-yuan-2213282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152531S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6330019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6330019","articleId":"6269119","onlineDate":"15 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269276,"authors":[{"name":"Sayori Seto","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Sayori","lastName":"Seto","id":"38468427400"},{"name":"Akinori Kanasugi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akinori","lastName":"Kanasugi","id":"37840596600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-9886-7870-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1288-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6269276","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269276","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed genetic algorithm","DGA","redundant binary number","optimization algorithm","evolution of life","combination optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed GA","redundant binary number"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel5/6260077/6269264/06269276.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Conference on Information Science and Digital Content Technology (ICIDT2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Conference on Information Science and Digital Content Technology (ICIDT2012)","startPage":"273","endPage":"276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel distributed genetic algorithm with redundant binary number","abstract":"Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of optimization algorithm based on an idea for evolution of life.

Besides the strength of cryptographic IP-cores on FPGAs the reconfiguration process of these modules has to be aware of both, algorithmic and implementation attacks in order to prevent unauthorized usage and counterfeiting. Due to the fact that most resources on the FPGA-based platforms are reserved for computation intensive operations, a lightweight solution for the secure reconfiguration scheme of the protected IP-cores is mandatory. In this work we address these challenges and propose a solution, which combines the research areas of trustworthy reconfiguration and side-channel analysis. The specific contributions to the aforementioned challenges are: (i) Exploration of different PRESENT implementations to optimize the trade-off between throughput and resource utilization. (ii) A side-channel analysis evaluation of different PRESENT implementations. (iii) Integration of an optimized and side-channel aware implementation into an efficient IP-protection scheme on FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2011.6269382","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6126157/6132640/06269382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2011.6269382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132640","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Side-Channel hardened IP-Protection Scheme for FPGA-based Platforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Side-Channel hardened IP-Protection Scheme for FPGA-based Platforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreNote":"As originally published there was an error in this document.

Thus, in this paper, we discuss a new mechanism of selecting representative data samples for Parzen windows method. An importance degree function is defined to evaluate the importance of data sample. Then, a decision threshold is optimized based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The data samples whose importance degrees are larger than the optimized decision threshold will be selected as the representations to estimate the underlying probability density function (PDF). Finally, the experimental results on the designed datasets obeying Uniform, Normal, Exponential, and Rayleigh distributions show that the estimation of PDF by using the representative data samples can obtain the same estimation errors (the two-tailed t-test with 95% confidence level) compared with the estimation on whole dataset. Meanwhile, the computational complexity of using representative data samples to estimate PDF is decreased evidently.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2012.6269434","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260028/6269390/06269434.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2012.6269434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new mechanism of selecting representative data samples for Parzen windows method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"A new mechanism of selecting representative data samples for Parzen windows method","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6269434/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12935296","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269434/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new mechanism of selecting representative data samples for Parzen windows method","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"043S023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045047S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260028","isNumber":"6269390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260028","xplore-issue":"6269390","articleId":"6269434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6269447,"authors":[{"name":"Yefei Zha","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, Huaiyin Institute of Technology, Huaian, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Yefei Zha","id":"38468375200"},{"name":"Quanyin Zhu","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, Huaiyin Institute of Technology, Huaian, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Quanyin Zhu","id":"37535152200"},{"name":"Yunyang Yan","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, Huaiyin Institute of Technology, Huaian, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Yunyang Yan","id":"37533746000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2008-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2007-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2006-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"6269447","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"abstract":"Both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Two-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2DPCA) are successful face recognition algorithm. High recognition accuracy can be achieved using these two methods on the normal facial database, such as ORL, FERET, Yale, AR, etc. In order to construct an enormous Face Database of Science and Technology Experts (FDSTE) for e-government, face recognition algorithm based on Web mining should be researched on pertinences. Because of the quality of images extracted from Web is largely distinct. So, an improved method based on 2DPCA called M-2DPCA is proposed in this paper which combines the merits of 2DPCA, PCA and LDA. That is, firstly, 2DPCA is used to deal with the original image matrixes, and then PCA is used to compress the feature matrixes again, at last we apply Fisher criterion to obtain the optimal set of discriminable vector for better classification. Experiments on the FDSTE show that M- 2DPCA is best than 2DPCA and PCA in terms of the classification speed and the recognition rate for the face recognition by Web mining. Experiment demonstrates that the proposed algorithm performance and proves this case is meaningful and useful for researching and application on the face recognition by Web mining.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6260028/6269390/06269447.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2012.6269447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2012.6269447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition of technology experts for e-government based on web mining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Image recognition","Face recognition","Matrix converters","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","face recognition","government data processing","Internet","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","technology experts","e-government","Web mining","principal component analysis","PCA","two-dimensional principal component analysis","2DPCA","normal facial database","Face Database of Science and Technology Experts","M-2DPCA","LDA","original image matrixes","feature matrixes","Fisher criterion","FDSTE","image quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PCA","2DPCA","face recognition","face database","M-2DPCA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition of technology experts for e-government based on web mining","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6269447/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12935309","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition of technology experts for e-government based on web mining","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"056S069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0881S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6260028","isNumber":"6269390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6260028","xplore-issue":"6269390","articleId":"6269447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6269478,"authors":[{"name":"Jialiang Lv","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Network, Shandong Computer Science Center, China","College of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Jialiang Lv","id":"37087877762"},{"name":"Huanqing Cui","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Network, Shandong Computer Science Center, China","College of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Huanqing Cui","id":"37088113108"},{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Network, Shandong Computer Science Center, China","College of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Ming Yang","id":"37087148506"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2008-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2007-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2006-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"6269478","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","sensor placement","statistical distributions","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribute localization","wireless sensor networks","particle swarm optimization problem","PSO-based localization methods","distributed PSO-based method","probabilistic distribution","objective function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor network","localization","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269478","abstract":"Localization is one the key technologies of wireless sensor networks, and the problem of localization is always formulate as an optimization problem.

The cloud computing methodology is a conceptual based technology which is used widely now a day. But in data privacy protection and data retrieval control is one of the most challenging research work in cloud computing, because of users secrete data which is to be stored by user. An enterprise usually store data in internal storage and then tries to protect the data from other outside source. They also provide authentication at certain specific level. Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to adopt IT services without upfront investment. Despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the organizations are slow in accepting it due to security issues and challenges associated with it. Security is one of the major issues which hamper the growth of cloud. The idea of handing over important data to another company is worrisome; such that the consumers need to be vigilant in understanding the risks of data breaches in this new environment. This paper introduces a detailed analysis of the cloud computing security issues and challenges focusing on the cloud computing types and the service delivery types. This paper mainly proposes the core concept of secured cloud computing. It suggests the cloud computing based on separate encryption and decryption services from the storage service. Due to this increasing demand for more clouds there is an ever growing threat of security becoming a major issue.

We enhance the global search ability at the beginning, while slowing down in the local search when the particles are near the local minimum by the linearly decreasing inertia weight. We apply the constriction factor with a value of 0.729 scales down the velocity step sizes, such that the particles can move without large overshoots at the beginning and smoothly approach the goals with a series of small steps when the particles are near the area of the optimal solution prior to the end of iterations. For a a quick convergence, the global star topology is chosen in this algorithm. The simulations performed on 2 well-known benchmark functions for over 50 runs indicate that the proposed algorithm with a population size of only 20 particles can achieve the goals quickly and accurately.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2012.6269606","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIMSA) Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2012.6269606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269588","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIMSA) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261592/6269588/06269606.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining concepts of inertia weights and constriction factors in particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269606/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combining concepts of inertia weights and constriction factors in particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6269606/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12935749","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining concepts of inertia weights and constriction factors in particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"1569604127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06217S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261592","isNumber":"6269588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261592","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6269588","articleId":"6269606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6269702,"authors":[{"name":"Ghada Gharbi","affiliation":["LAAS, CNRS, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Ghada","lastName":"Gharbi","id":"38468523800"},{"name":"Mahdi Ben Alaya","affiliation":["LAAS, CNRS, Toulouse, France","LAAS, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Ben Alaya","id":"37705620800"},{"name":"Cod\u00e9 Diop","affiliation":["LAAS, CNRS, Toulouse, France","LAAS, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Cod\u00e9","lastName":"Diop","id":"38233411600"},{"name":"Ernesto Exposito","affiliation":["LAAS, CNRS, Toulouse, France","LAAS, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Exposito","id":"37294799200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1888-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4717-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1524-4547"},{"format":"CD","value":"1524-4547"}],"articleNumber":"6269702","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"abstract":"The large diversity and heterogeneity of collaborating objects and services in modern networked environments such as personal, vehicular or home networks makes difficult the efficient configuration, deployment and management of composite dynamic systems without a major participation of human actors.

The metamaterial consists of coupled \u201cbright\u201d split-ring resonators (SRRs) and \u201cdark\u201d spiral resonators (SRs) with virtually equal resonance frequencies. Normally incident plane waves with linear polarization strongly couple to the SRR, but are weakly interacting with the SR, regardless of the polarization state. A sharp transmission peak (i.e., the transparency window) with narrow spectral width and slow wave property is observed for the metamaterial at the resonant frequency of both, the bright SRR and the dark SR. The influence of the coupling strength between the SRR and SR on the frequency, width, magnitude, and quality factor of the metamaterial's transparency window is theoretically predicted by a two-particle model, and numerically validated using full-wave electromagnetic simulation. In addition, it is numerically demonstrated that the EIT-like metamaterial can be employed as a refractive-index-based sensor with a sensitivity of 77.25 mm/RIU, which means that the resonance wavelength of the sensor shifts 77.25 mm per unit change of refractive index of the surrounding medium.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6269906/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13030662","volume":"60","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Polarization-Independent Metamaterial Analog of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency for a Refractive-Index-Based Sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization-Independent Metamaterial Analog of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency for a Refractive-Index-Based Sensor","sourcePdf":"tmtt-meng-2209455-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090399S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6314489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"6314489","articleId":"6269906","onlineDate":"16 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6269915,"authors":[{"name":"P.

grounding system plays an important part in the lightning protection system of power and communication systems. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is widely used in modeling complex electromagnetic interaction problems. However, it is difficult to model the earthing conductor using the standard FDTD method in the transient grounding resistance (TGR) analysis for the electrically small depth of the earthing conductors. In this letter, a new method has been proposed to model the earthing conductor by incorporating the singularities of the field variation near the conductor into the Faraday's contour path. The efficiency of the proposed model has been approved by verifying both the supposed field distribution near the earthing conductor and the TGR.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2012.2213569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6170612/06269916.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2012.2213569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD Modeling of the Earthing Conductor in the Transient Grounding Resistance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269916/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Modeling of the Earthing Conductor in the Transient Grounding Resistance Analysis","volume":"11","publicationDate":"2012","accessionNumber":"13033743","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6269916/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Modeling of the Earthing Conductor in the Transient Grounding Resistance Analysis","sourcePdf":"lawp-xiong-2213569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107048S","chronDate":"2012","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6170612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6170612","articleId":"6269916","onlineDate":"16 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269919,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Wen Lee","affiliation":["Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tsung-Wen","lastName":"Lee","id":"38477318500"},{"name":"Janice H.

After electroforming, switching occurs in a rebuilt oxide between the electroformed conductive filament and the Pt electrode. RM is independent of initial oxide thickness. The switching mechanism is postulated as dielectric breakdown at the sidewall of the conductive channel created within the rebuilt oxide: During a SET operation to a lower resistance state, the conductive channel increases in size, conducting a larger current until limited by the external compliance; during a RESET operation to a higher resistance state, the tip of the oxygen-saturated tantalum conductive channel is oxidized, reforming the rebuilt oxide. The conduction of the rebuilt oxide follows a power law function of voltage, in parallel with the modulated channel conductance. The linear resistance can be randomly programmed with accuracy and reproducibility.

Advancements in multiple antenna systems enable reliable broadband wireless communications using multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmission technology. In addition, through collaboration of several single-antenna-equipped devices, cooperative MIMO communication is possible in the form of virtual MIMO (V-MIMO), virtual multiple-input-single-output (V-MISO), and virtual single-input-multiple-output (V-SIMO), which are collectively called V-MIMO technology. In this paper, a multihop hybrid V-MIMO (HV-MIMO) networking scheme is proposed to configure a minimum energy consuming route (MECR) that provides high end-to-end connectivity while satisfying end-to-end data rate and bit error rate (BER) requirements by using the best cooperative MIMO configuration for each hop. In the proposed scheme, first, the source-to-destination path is divided into long wireless communication hops, and the minimum energy consuming V-MIMO configuration is applied to each hop. Next, the long communication hops are individually evaluated for replacement with two half-length V-MIMO hops, where changes are applied only when a gain in energy consumption is obtainable. If no gain is obtainable for a certain hop, then the hop configuration is not changed, and that hop is no longer compared for replacement. This procedure of testing for possible replacement with two half-length hops is repeated individually for all hops until no further changes are made in the source-to-destination path, which is when the HV-MIMO MECR is complete. For equivalent end-to-end data rate and BER requirements, the proposed HV-MIMO multihop scheme provides a significant energy saving (e.g., 52.32% energy saving at the node density of 0.003 nodes/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) compared with the conventional SISO multihop path's MECR. In addition, the HV-MIMO scheme always results in an energy saving gain and a significantly higher end-to-end multihop MECR connection probability compared with using the same type of cooperative MIMO configuration for each hop (i.e., homogeneous V-MIMO configuration).","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6353156/06269940.pdf","startPage":"4069","endPage":"4078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop Hybrid Virtual MIMO Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2213620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2213620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Multihop Hybrid Virtual MIMO Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115784","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6269940/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop Hybrid Virtual MIMO Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-chung-2213620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110405S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6353156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6353156","articleId":"6269940","onlineDate":"16 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269964,"authors":[{"name":"Rani S.

While current approaches for defining design rules are largely unsystematic and empirical in nature, this paper offers a novel framework for early and systematic evaluation of design rules and layout styles in terms of major layout characteristics of area, manufacturability, and variability. The framework essentially creates a virtual standard-cell library and performs the evaluation based on the virtual layouts. Due to the focus on the exploration of rules at an early stage of technology development, we use first-order models of variability and manufacturability (instead of relying on accurate simulation) and layout topology/congestion-based area estimates (instead of explicit and slow layout generation). Such a framework can be used to co-evaluate and cooptimize design rules, patterning technologies, layout methodologies, and library architectures.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2012.2192477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6269957/06269964.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2012.2192477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269957","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRE: A Framework for Early Co-Evaluation of Design Rules, Technology Choices, and Layout Methodologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DRE: A Framework for Early Co-Evaluation of Design Rules, Technology Choices, and Layout Methodologies","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269964/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933195","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6269964/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRE: A Framework for Early Co-Evaluation of Design Rules, Technology Choices, and Layout Methodologies","sourcePdf":"tcad-ghaida-2192477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133725S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6269957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6269957","articleId":"6269964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269965,"authors":[{"name":"Chirag Ravishankar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6269957/6269965/6269965-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chirag Ravishankar (S'11) received the B.A. Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2010.

The concept is rooted in the property that under certain conditions, some signals within digital designs are not \u201cobservable\u201d at design outputs, making the circuitry that generates such signals a candidate for guarding. Guarded evaluation has been demonstrated successfully for application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs); in this paper, we apply the technique to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In ASICs, guarded evaluation entails adding additional hardware to the design, increasing silicon area and cost. Here, we apply the technique in a way that imposes minimal area overhead by leveraging existing unused circuitry within the FPGA. The primary challenge in guarded evaluation is in determining the specific conditions under which a subcircuit's inputs can be held constant without impacting the larger circuit's functional correctness. We propose a simple solution to this problem based on discovering gating inputs using \u201cnoninverting\u201d and \u201cpartial noninverting\u201d paths in a circuit's AND-inverter graph representation. Experimental results show that guarded evaluation can reduce switching activity on average by as much as 32% and 25% for 6-input look-up table (6-LUT) and 4-LUT architectures, respectively. Dynamic power consumption in the FPGA interconnect is reduced on average by as much as 24% and 22% for 6-LUT and 4-LUT architectures, respectively. The impact to critical path delay ranges from 1% to 43%, depending on the guarding scenario and the desired power/delay tradeoff.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6269957/06269965.pdf","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2012.2192478","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2012.2192478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Power Reduction by Guarded Evaluation Considering Logic Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Power Reduction by Guarded Evaluation Considering Logic Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269965/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6269965/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933196","volume":"31","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Power Reduction by Guarded Evaluation Considering Logic Architecture","sourcePdf":"tcad-anderson-2192478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107769S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6269957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6269957","articleId":"6269965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269969,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Kai Hsu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6269957/6269969/6269969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Meng-Kai Hsu received B.S. degrees in electronics engineering and computer science from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2007.

The fast-growing design complexity with large-scale mixed-size macros and standard cells has caused significant challenges to modern circuit placement. Analytical algorithms have been shown to be most effective for standard-cell placement, but the problems with the rotation and legalization of large macros impose intrinsic limitations for analytical placement. Consequently, most recent works on mixed-size placement resort to combinatorial macro placement. Instead, this paper presents the first attempt to resolve the intrinsic problems with a unified analytical approach. Unlike traditional analytical placement that uses only wire and density forces to optimize the positions of circuit components, we present a new force, the rotation force, to handle macro orientation for analytical mixed-size placement. The rotation force tries to rotate each macro to its desired orientation based on the wire connections on this macro. A cross potential model is also proposed to increase the rotation freedom during placement. The final orientation of each macro with legalization consideration is then determined by mathematical programming. A macro flipping force is also proposed to determine the flipping orientation of each macro at the end of global placement. Compared with start-of-the-art mixed-size placement approaches (such as FLOP, CG, and MP-tree), our approach achieves the best average wirelength efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2012.2193582","startPage":"1366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6269957/06269969.pdf","endPage":"1378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2012.2193582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269969/","displayDocTitle":"Unified Analytical Global Placement for Large-Scale Mixed-Size Circuit Designs","volume":"31","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6269969/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12933200","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Analytical Global Placement for Large-Scale Mixed-Size Circuit Designs","sourcePdf":"tcad-chang-2193582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085652S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6269957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6269957","articleId":"6269969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6269975,"authors":[{"name":"Irith Pomeranz","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6269957/6269975/6269975-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Irith Pomeranz (M'89\u2013SM'96\u2013F'99) received the B.

Multicycle tests provide the flexibility of improving the quality of a test set by increasing the number of clock cycles in each test, without increasing the number of tests. Improved test quality is thus achieved with limited increases in test application time and test data volume due to the larger numbers of clock cycles in each test. This paper describes a procedure that starts from a compact one-detection single-cycle test set for single stuck-at faults and produces a multicycle test set with the same number of tests, but increased numbers of clock cycles and improved test quality. The procedure uses only one-detection fault simulation of single stuck-at faults. A similar procedure is applied starting from a two-cycle test set and considering transition faults. The procedures produce tests with constant primary input vectors to accommodate tester limitations.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2012.2193583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6269957/06269975.pdf","startPage":"1428","endPage":"1438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2012.2193583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicycle Tests With Constant Primary Input Vectors for Increased Fault Coverage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269975/","displayDocTitle":"Multicycle Tests With Constant Primary Input Vectors for Increased Fault Coverage","volume":"31","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933206","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6269975/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicycle Tests With Constant Primary Input Vectors for Increased Fault Coverage","sourcePdf":"tcad-pomeranz-2193583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115173S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6269957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6269957","articleId":"6269975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269978,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Hung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Ching-Hung Chang was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in December 1976.

By reasonably multiplexing the OFDM and CATV signals into a CATV transmitter, both signals originated from a central office (CO) are successfully transmitted over a span of 60 km single mode fiber (SMF) and another span of 25 m GI-POF to consumers' devices. Although the SMF and GI-POF have different core sizes and attenuation features, no any bridge circuit or wavelength converter is utilized in the proposed architecture resulting in a transparent platform for the Internet service providers (ISPs) to directly manage their long-distance services toward suburban or rural areas. Since the optical signal generated at the CO can be transmitted straightforward to the consumers' devices, the average packet delay and packet overhead size can be greatly reduced and the quality of services (QoS) can be maintained easier. Good experimental performances of the CATV and OFDM signals transmission proof the practice and efficiency of this proposal to extend multimedia services from metro areas to suburban and rural areas.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2213067","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6313970/06269978.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2213067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313970","startPage":"3247","endPage":"3251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Long-Reach PON and GI-POF In-House Network Architecture for Hybrid CATV/OFDM Signals Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Long-Reach PON and GI-POF In-House Network Architecture for Hybrid CATV/OFDM Signals Transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"20","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2012","accessionNumber":"13053814","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6269978/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Long-Reach PON and GI-POF In-House Network Architecture for Hybrid CATV/OFDM Signals Transmission","sourcePdf":"jlt-lu-2213067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058815S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6313970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6313970","articleId":"6269978","onlineDate":"16 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6269979,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad H.

The proposed method is experimentally proved by fully characterizing the time-varying amplitude and phase of single-shot THz-bandwidth optical signals, with durations ranging from sub-ps to 35 000 ps, with ultrasmall to ultralarge temporal phase variations and at 25-MHz update rate.

This paper intends to tackle the impractical time-invariant assumptions which underlie the methods currently used to develop short-term traffic flow predictors: 1) the characteristics of current data captured by on-road sensors are assumed to be time invariant with respect to those of the historical data, which is used to developed short-term traffic flow predictors; and 2) the configuration of the on-road sensor systems is assumed to be time-invariant. In fact, both assumptions are impractical in the real world, as the current traffic flow characteristics can be very different from the historical ones, and also the on-road sensor systems are time varying in nature due to damaged sensors or component wear. Therefore, misleading forecasting results are likely to be produced when short-term traffic flow predictors are designed using these two time-invariant assumptions. To tackle these time-invariant assumptions, an intelligent particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is proposed to develop short-term traffic flow predictors by integrating the mechanisms of PSO, neural network and fuzzy inference system, to adapt to the time-varying traffic flow characteristics and the time-varying configurations of the on-road sensor systems. The proposed IPSO was applied to forecast traffic flow conditions on a section of freeway in Western Australia, whose traffic flow information can be captured on-line by the on-road sensor system. These results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of using the proposed IPSO for real-time traffic flow forecasting based on traffic flow data captured by on-road sensor systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13502286","htmlLink":"/document/6269995/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Intelligent Particle Swarm Optimization for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting Using on-Road Sensor Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intelligent Particle Swarm Optimization for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting Using on-Road Sensor Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-chan-2213556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126964S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6516975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6516975","articleId":"6269995","onlineDate":"16 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6269996,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Immovilli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi dellIngegneria, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6497104/6269996/6269996-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabio Immovilli was born in Italy on March 11, 1981.

Two approaches are usually available to define this relationship. The former is based on airgap variations, while the latter is based on torque perturbation. This paper is focused on the airgap variation model. The ball bearing fault is modeled by contact mechanics. External vibrations often occur in many industrial applications where externally induced vibrations of suitable amplitude cause cyclic radial loading on the machine shaft. The model is validated by experiments, owing to a dedicated test setup, where an external vibration source (shaker) was employed, together with ball bearing alterations in order to decrease the stiffness of the support along the radial direction. To maximize the effects of externally induced vibrations, the frequency chosen was near the flexural resonance of the rotor (determined by finite-element method analysis). The direction of the external vibration is radial with respect to the axis of the electric machine under test. During tests, both stator phase currents and vibration of the machine were sampled. The test setup allowed one to vary the machine speed and load, vibration amplitude, and bearing stiffness (damage level). Radial effects are usually visible only in the case of large failures that result in significant airgap variations, as confirmed by experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6497104/06269996.pdf","startPage":"3408","endPage":"3418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2213566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2213566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6497104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6269996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bearing Fault Model for Induction Motor With Externally Induced Vibration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibrations","Frequency modulation","Rotors","Atmospheric modeling","Shafts","Force","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","ball bearings","finite element analysis","induction motors","shafts","stators","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damage level","bearing stiffness","vibration amplitude","machine load","machine speed","stator phase currents","electric machine","FEM","finite-element method analysis","flexural resonance","radial direction","ball bearing alterations","test setup","shaker","machine shaft","cyclic radial loading","industrial applications","contact mechanics","ball bearing fault","airgap variation model","torque perturbation","externally induced vibration","induction motors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Airgaps","ball bearings","condition monitoring","current measurement","fault diagnosis","frequency domain analysis","harmonic analysis","induction motors","modulation","vibration measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Bearing Fault Model for Induction Motor With Externally Induced Vibration","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6269996/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13431025","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bearing Fault Model for Induction Motor With Externally Induced Vibration","sourcePdf":"tie-immovilli-2213566-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073738S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6497104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6497104","articleId":"6269996","onlineDate":"16 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6269998,"authors":[{"name":"Akshay K.

The proposed converter achieves zero-current switching (ZCS) of the primary-side active semiconductor devices and zero-voltage switching of the secondary-side active semiconductor devices. It is a potential topology for FCVs, front-end dc/dc power conversion for fuel cell inverters, and energy storage. A proposed secondary-modulation clamps the voltage across the primary-side devices (current fed) naturally and eliminates switch turn-off voltage spike concern with ZCS without any additional circuit. This leads to reduced footprints and lower cost. Voltage across the primary-side current-fed devices is independent of duty cycle like conventional current-fed converters but clamped at a reflected output voltage. Therefore, comparatively low-voltage-rating devices with a low on-state resistance are used, introducing low conduction losses and higher efficiency. Steady-state analysis, operation, design, simulation, and experimental results of the proposed converter are reported in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6269998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6269998/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13502288","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Experimental Results of Novel Snubberless Bidirectional Naturally Clamped ZCS/ZVS Current-Fed Half-Bridge DC/DC Converter for Fuel Cell Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Design, and Experimental Results of Novel Snubberless Bidirectional Naturally Clamped ZCS/ZVS Current-Fed Half-Bridge DC/DC Converter for Fuel Cell Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tie-rathore-2213563-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066669S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6516975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6516975","articleId":"6269998","onlineDate":"16 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"}]
