On account of applying pesticide a cheaper and more efficiently way, it was aimed to use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is able to fly on and spray farmland autonomously. Accordingly, necessary system components were developed such as an auto pilot system that controls UAV, a ground control station that is used for tracing UAV, and a spraying mechanism. It can be estimated how much time, distance is required and how many refills the UAV needs for a specific farmland before implementing for real by using a developed simulator.

In this paper, broadcast beamforming design with antenna selection is considered for cognitive radio networks. In the presence of primary users, it is usually difficult to satisfy quality of service (QoS) constraints of the all secondary users while keeping the interference towards the primary users below a certain threshold. User selection is a good method in order to make the problem feasible. In this paper, discrete phase-only beamforming is considered due to its simplicity and certain advantages. The joint problem is converted into linear form and solved optimally by using mixed integer linear programming. Simulation results show that significant power saving is possible compared to fixed antenna systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15236511","htmlLink":"/document/7130119/","conferenceDate":"16-19 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Discrete broadcast beamforming with antenna and user selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete broadcast beamforming with antenna and user selection","confLoc":"Malatya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086055S","chronDate":"16-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7116933","isNumber":"7129794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116933","xplore-issue":"7129794","articleId":"7130119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130125,"authors":[{"name":"Abidin \u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan","affiliation":["Bilgisayar M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc BATMAN \u00dcniversitesi, Batman, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Abidin","lastName":"\u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan","id":"37061967500"},{"name":"\u00d6mer Faruk Ertu\u011frul","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, BATMAN \u00dcniversitesi, Batman, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"\u00d6mer Faruk","lastName":"Ertu\u011frul","id":"37061936900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"7130125","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Wavelet transforms","Conferences","Image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint recognition","biometric system","human identification","Gabor wavelet transform","gray scale fingerprint image","PolyU high resolution fingerprint database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["biometric system","fingerprint recognition","gabor wavelet transform","k nearest neighbor"]}],"abstract":"A biometric system provides automatic identification of an individual based on a unique feature or characteristic possessed by the individual. Today, fingerprint has a wide field of use in several areas of biometric system.

In this work, Gabor Wavelet Transform based fingerprint recognition system has been realized. The wavelet features are extracted from the gray-scale fingerprint image.

The performance of the estimator is investigated by evaluating the Mean Square Error of estimations. The simulations are done using measured channel data taken from the literature with additive white Gaussian noise assumption. The results show that the proposed estimator has better performance compared to Maximum Likelihood estimator. This performance improvement is clearer especially for low to moderate SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2015.7130139","publicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116933/7129794/07130139.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2015.7130139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7129794","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation for OFDM systems in Power Line Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for OFDM systems in Power Line Communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130139/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15236351","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130139/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for OFDM systems in Power Line Communication","confLoc":"Malatya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091796S","chronDate":"16-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7116933","isNumber":"7129794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116933","xplore-issue":"7129794","articleId":"7130139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130149,"authors":[{"name":"U\u011fur K\u00f6se","affiliation":["Ondokuz Mayis Universitesi, Samsun, TR"],"firstName":"U\u011fur","lastName":"K\u00f6se"},{"name":"Adil Emre \u00d6zen","affiliation":["Ondokuz Mayis Universitesi, Samsun, TR"],"firstName":"Adil Emre","lastName":"\u00d6zen"},{"name":"\u00c7etin Kurnaz","affiliation":["Ondokuz Mayis Universitesi, Samsun, TR"],"firstName":"\u00c7etin","lastName":"Kurnaz"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"7130149","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multiuser detection","Interference cancellation","Fading","Spread spectrum communication","Multipath channels","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","multiuser detection","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Manchester city center","3-finger rake receiver structure","wideband CDMA","radio channel profile effect","active user signal","MAI signal removal","user information estimation","PIC","MAI","multiple-access interference","MUD method","multiuser detection method","CDMA-based systems","parallel interference cancellation","WCDMA system","wireless radio channel effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WCDMA","multiple access interference","multi user detection","parallel interference cancellation","matched filter"]}],"abstract":"In CDMA based systems with the use of multi-user detection (MUD) methods the effects of multiple access interference (MAI) can be decreased and system performance can be increased. One of these methods which is parallel interference cancellation (PIC) is based on instantly estimating all users' information and removing MAI signal from active user signal. In this study, the effects of radio channel profiles and number of users on wideband CDMA (WCDMA) with parallel interference cancellation (PIC) are investigated. In the assessments, 2, 4, 8, 15 numbers of users, 3-finger rake receiver structure, and four different channel profiles measured in Manchester city center are used. It is observed from the results that the performance of PIC is changed dramatically depending upon channel's profile and number of users.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2015.7130149","publicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116933/7129794/07130149.pdf","startPage":"1574","endPage":"1577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2015.7130149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7129794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of wireless radio channel on WCDMA system with paralel interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130149/","displayDocTitle":"The effect of wireless radio channel on WCDMA system with paralel interference cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15236398","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130149/","conferenceDate":"16-19 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of wireless radio channel on WCDMA system with paralel interference cancellation","confLoc":"Malatya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058809S","chronDate":"16-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7116933","isNumber":"7129794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7129794","articleId":"7130149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130163,"authors":[{"name":"Ufuk Tamer","affiliation":["Anketek Elektronik Teknoloji, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Ufuk","lastName":"Tamer"},{"name":"Cansu Sunu","affiliation":["Hacettepe Universitesi, Ankara, Ankara, TR"],"firstName":"Cansu","lastName":"Sunu"},{"name":"Emre Akta\u015f","affiliation":["Hacettepe Universitesi, Ankara, Ankara, TR"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Akta\u015f"},{"name":"Ali \u00d6zg\u00fcr Y\u0131lmaz","affiliation":["Orta Dogu Teknik Universitesi, Ankara, Ankara, TR"],"firstName":"Ali \u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"Y\u0131lmaz"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"7130163","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Interference","Array signal processing","Wireless communication","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming techniques","multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication systems","multi-user MIMO system","MU-MIMO systems","RF impairments","transceivers","interference cancellation beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Model","Residual RF Impairments","Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication systems substantially suffer from RF Impairments in the course of the physical implementation of transceivers.

The facts that multiple antennas and the number of multipath affects spectrum sensing performance in the positive direction while the speed of the mobile affects this performance in the negative direction were obtained.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2015.7130281","publicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116933/7129794/07130281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2015.7130281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7129794","startPage":"2086","endPage":"2089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel effect on performance of energy based spectrum sensing in MIMO cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel effect on performance of energy based spectrum sensing in MIMO cognitive radio","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130281/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15236593","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130281/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel effect on performance of energy based spectrum sensing in MIMO cognitive radio","confLoc":"Malatya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062419S","chronDate":"16-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7116933","isNumber":"7129794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7129794","articleId":"7130281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130285,"authors":[{"name":"Anil Yesilkaya","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Kadir Has \u00dcniversitesi, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Yesilkaya","id":"37085664164"},{"name":"Huseyin Fuat Alsan","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Kadir Has \u00dcniversitesi, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Huseyin Fuat","lastName":"Alsan","id":"38466736100"},{"name":"Farshad Miramirkhani","affiliation":["Ozyegin Universitesi, Istanbul, TR"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Miramirkhani"},{"name":"Erdal Panayirci","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Kadir Has \u00dcniversitesi, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Panayirci","id":"37344633800"},{"name":"Habib Senol","affiliation":["Kadir Has Universitesi, Istanbul, TR"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Senol"},{"name":"Murat Uysal","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u00d6zye\u011fin \u00dcniversitesi, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Uysal","id":"37278726600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"7130285","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bit error rate","Optical transmitters","AWGN","Integrated optics","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","indoor radio","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light channel","performance analysis","ACO-OFDM","spectrum scarcity","radio communication","indoor visible light communication","additive white Gaussian noise","asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","optical communication","AWGN optical channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible Light Communication","OFDM","ACOOFDM","Indoor Channel Modeling"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum scarcity of traditional radio communication has led communication engineers to find new alternatives. Indoor visible light communication is one alternative to solve this problem since its spectrum is not regulated and it has much wider bandwidth then traditional communication systems. This increased the research done in the field of visible light communications. However a proper indoor channel model is lacking and all previous studies assumes that only additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is present. Lack of proper channel model has motivated us to model a realistic indoor visible light channel. After modeling the indoor visible light channel, the performance of an asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACOOFDM) system which is suitable for optical communications is investigated and compared to that of the AWGN optical channels.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2015.7130285","publicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116933/7129794/07130285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2015.7130285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7129794","startPage":"2102","endPage":"2105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of visible light channels and performance analysis of ACO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of visible light channels and performance analysis of ACO-OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130285/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15236638","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130285/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of visible light channels and performance analysis of ACO-OFDM","confLoc":"Malatya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047953S","chronDate":"16-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7116933","isNumber":"7129794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116933","xplore-issue":"7129794","articleId":"7130285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130295,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zlem Tu\u011ffe Demir","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"\u00d6zlem Tu\u011ffe","lastName":"Demir","id":"37062071800"},{"name":"T.

Two-phase relay communication is adopted. In the first phase, a source transmits common information to multiple relays which use amplify-and-forward relay protocol. Each relay multiplies its received signal by a complex weight and transmits it to the receivers. The amplitudes and phases of complex relay weights are chosen from discrete sets in order to decrease overhead for the feedback channel. Relay selection is employed in order to decrease network complexity. Nonlinear optimization problem is converted to a linear form suitable for mixed integer linear programming. The optimum solution can be found using branch-and-cut method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15236766","htmlLink":"/document/7130295/","conferenceDate":"16-19 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Discrete relay beamforming for broadcasting with relay selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete relay beamforming for broadcasting with relay selection","confLoc":"Malatya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055723S","chronDate":"16-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7116933","isNumber":"7129794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116933","xplore-issue":"7129794","articleId":"7130295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7130303,"authors":[{"name":"Semiha Tedik Basaran","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u0130stanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Semiha Tedik","lastName":"Basaran","id":"37085659312"},{"name":"Gunes Karabulut Kurt","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u0130stanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Gunes Karabulut","lastName":"Kurt","id":"38191208100"},{"name":"Bugra Engin","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u0130stanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Bugra","lastName":"Engin","id":"37085659190"},{"name":"Ibrahim Altunbas","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, \u0130stanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, \u0130stanbul, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Altunbas","id":"37443120300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"7130303","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"abstract":"In this work, a method that evaluates both subcarrier and power allocations together for the users of OFDMA systems is proposed.

Anomaly detection can be considered as the first approach, which analyses the hyperspectral image with respect to the difference between target and the rest of the hyperspectral image. The second approach compares the previously obtained spectral signature of the target with the pixels of the hyperspectral image in order to localize the target. A distinctive disadvantage of the aforementioned approaches is to treat each pixel of the hyperspectral image individually, without considering the neighbourhood relations between the pixels. In this paper, we propose a target detection algorithm which combines the anomaly detection and signature based hyperspectral target detection approaches in a graph based framework by utilizing the neighbourhood relations between the pixels. Assuming that the target signature is available and the target sizes are in the range of anomaly sizes, a novel derivative based matched filter is first proposed to model the foreground. Second, a new anomaly detection method which models the background as a Gaussian mixture is developed. The developed model estimates the optimal number of components forming the Gaussian mixture by means of utilizing sparsity information. Finally, the similarity of the neighbouring hyperspectral pixels is measured with the spectral angle mapper. The overall proposed graph based method has successfully combined the foreground, background and neighbouring information and improved the detection performance by locating the target as a whole object free from noises.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2015.7130428","publicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116933/7129794/07130428.pdf","startPage":"2631","endPage":"2634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2015.7130428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7129794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly based target detection in hyperspectral images via graph cuts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130428/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly based target detection in hyperspectral images via graph cuts","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15236465","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130428/","conferenceDate":"16-19 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly based target detection in hyperspectral images via graph cuts","confLoc":"Malatya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079656S","chronDate":"16-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7116933","isNumber":"7129794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116933","xplore-issue":"7129794","articleId":"7130428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130431,"authors":[{"name":"Deniz Korkmaz","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Bilgisayar E\u011fitimi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc"],"firstName":"Deniz","lastName":"Korkmaz","id":"38468089700"},{"name":"Cafer Bal","affiliation":["Mekatronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc"],"firstName":"Cafer","lastName":"Bal","id":"38468089900"},{"name":"Muammer G\u00f6kbulut","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, F\u0131rat \u00dcniversitesi, Elaz\u0131\u011f, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Muammer","lastName":"G\u00f6kbulut","id":"37085633999"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7386-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"7130431","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130431","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Robots","MATLAB","Conferences","Artificial neural networks","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","nonlinear systems","pendulums"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverted pendulum modeling","cart","artificial neural networks","mathematical model","single bar inverted pendulum","robotic arm","Lagrange method","nonlinear model","Matlab environment","multilayer artificial neural networks","back propagation learning algorithm","dynamic NARX network model","MANN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inverted pendulum","artificial neural networks","lagrange method","nonlinear modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIU.2015.7130431","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116933/7129794/07130431.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","startPage":"2642","endPage":"2645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7129794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2015.7130431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of inverted pendulum on a cart by using Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"In this study, mathematical model of the single bar inverted pendulum on a cart, which exhibits similar behavior to the dynamics of a robotic arm, is derived by using Lagrange method.

The offset-16QAM scheme can greatly relax the implementation complexity, because the tap number of 35 is sufficient for the required finite impulse response (FIR) filter, compared with 81-tap FIR filter of the 16QAM scheme. About 1.3-dB back-to-back sensitivity improvement is obtained for the offset-16QAM scheme. In particular, the offset-16QAM scheme has better tolerance of DACs' constraints, including the untracked jitter, sampling rate, and resolution. Finally, the practical implementation of offset-16QAM-based Nyquist WDM superchannel with TS-DSS is evaluated, by taking the phase difference deviation among wavelength channels and phase noise into account. No more than 1.3-dB required-OSNR penalty can be obtained, in case the phase difference is varied from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0.

Wide-angle impedance matching (WAIM) alleviates this problem from a transmission-line impedance matching viewpoint, increasing the useable scan range of the array. Traditionally, a dielectric slab is placed at some distance above the array, resulting in a match at some given angle off broadside. We propose a simpler and more effective solution, replacing the dielectric slab with an ultra-thin metasurface composed of a sheet of split-ring resonators (SRRs) to improve the scanning characteristics of a dipole phased array. It is shown that the presence of the metasurface results in significant improvements in multiple scan planes. A generalized equivalent transmission-line model is introduced for the classical WAIM configuration and adapted for the metasurface. A quasianalytical model based on the equivalent transmission-line model and the extracted scattering parameters of the metasurface properly predicts the scan range of the full structure, and allows for an accelerated design process.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2448231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7234961/07130580.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2448231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7234961","startPage":"3928","endPage":"3938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Characterization of a Wide-Angle Impedance Matching Metasurface for Dipole Phased Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Characterization of a Wide-Angle Impedance Matching Metasurface for Dipole Phased Arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130580/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15431219","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130580/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Characterization of a Wide-Angle Impedance Matching Metasurface for Dipole Phased Arrays","sourcePdf":"tap-cameron-2448231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122902S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7234961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7234961","articleId":"7130580","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7130581,"authors":[{"name":"Guang Yang","affiliation":["Neuroscience Research Centre, Cardiovascular and Cell Sciences Institute, St. George's, University of London, London, U.K.","National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085559780"},{"name":"Tahir Nawaz","affiliation":["Computational Vision Group, University of Reading","City University London"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Tahir","lastName":"Nawaz","id":"38242540700"},{"name":"Thomas R.

Providing an improved technique which can assist clinicians in accurately identifying brain tumor grades is our main objective. The proposed technique, which is based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of whole-spectral or subspectral information of key metabolites, combined with unsupervised learning, inspects the separability of the extracted wavelet features from the MRS signal to aid the clustering. In total, we included 134 short echo time single voxel MRS spectra (SV MRS) in our study that cover normal controls, low grade and high grade tumors. The combination of DWT-based whole-spectral or subspectral analysis and unsupervised clustering achieved an overall clustering accuracy of 94.8% and a balanced error rate of 7.8%. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study using DWT combined with unsupervised learning to cluster brain SV MRS. Instead of dimensionality reduction on SV MRS or feature selection using model fitting, our study provides an alternative method of extracting features to obtain promising clustering results.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2448232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7331704/07130581.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2448232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331704","startPage":"2860","endPage":"2866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete Wavelet Transform-Based Whole-Spectral and Subspectral Analysis for Improved Brain Tumor Clustering Using Single Voxel MR Spectroscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete Wavelet Transform-Based Whole-Spectral and Subspectral Analysis for Improved Brain Tumor Clustering Using Single Voxel MR Spectroscopy","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130581/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601906","pubMedId":"26111385","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130581/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CRUK","grantNumber":"C1459/A13303"},{"fundingName":"City University London Pump Priming"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete Wavelet Transform-Based Whole-Spectral and Subspectral Analysis for Improved Brain Tumor Clustering Using Single Voxel MR Spectroscopy","sourcePdf":"tbme-yang-2448232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109348S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7331704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7331704","articleId":"7130581","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7130584,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Antonello","affiliation":["Department of Management and Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7293755/7130584/anton-2448514-small.gif","p":["\n\nRiccardo Antonello (M'02) received the Laurea degree (\ncum laude) in computer engineering and the Ph.D. degree in automatic control from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","From 2006 to 2010, he was a Research Associate with the Department of Mechanical and Structural Engineering, University of Trento, Trento, Italy.

Two different estimation methods are presented for this purpose. The first is a readjustment of a classic procedure based on the detection, by means of the injection of voltage test pulses, of inductance variations due to motor saliencies, from which it is then possible to infer the position of the rotor. Since the application of irregular test pulses may increase the estimation uncertainties, the available voltage measurement is exploited to implement a closed-loop amplitude control of the test pulses. The second method is introduced both to overcome an issue related to the digital measurement approach adopted in this paper and to allow position estimation even in a motor with no relevant saliency, a case for which the first method is inappropriate. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is validated by several experimental tests, which are carried out on two motors with different saliency properties.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2448514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7293755/07130584.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2448514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7293755","startPage":"6719","endPage":"6726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits of Direct Phase Voltage Measurement in the Rotor Initial Position Detection for Permanent-Magnet Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Benefits of Direct Phase Voltage Measurement in the Rotor Initial Position Detection for Permanent-Magnet Motor Drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15519512","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130584/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefits of Direct Phase Voltage Measurement in the Rotor Initial Position Detection for Permanent-Magnet Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tie-antonello-2448514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075943S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7293755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7293755","articleId":"7130584","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7130585,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Scherh\u00e4ufl","affiliation":["Department of Sensors and Communication, Linz Center of Mechatronics GmbH, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7293766/7130585/scher-2440554-small.gif","p":["Martin Scherh\u00e4ufl (S\u201912\u2013GSM\u201914) was born in Linz, Austria, in 1981.

Measurements were carried out in an indoor office environment where the 3.5 m \u00d7 2.5 m measurement zone was surrounded by drywalls and concrete floor and ceiling. The experimental results showed accurate localization with a root-mean-square error of 0.020 m and a median error of 0.011 m.

The electromagnetic waves at the low microwave frequency range penetrate into common building materials and thereby enable the radar to expose behind the wall scene. However, due to complexity of the scattering scenario, the radar signal undergoes multipath propagation phenomena. These typically manifest themselves as environmental clutter which may impair detection and tracking of true targets. In this paper, a signal processing strategy is proposed to track multiple extended targets in a scene by means of a wide-band monostatic through-wall radar. The system collects data sets at regular time steps which are first processed by a microwave tomographic technique. Then, a detection/tracking stage is implemented in order to track the position and dynamics of targets in real time. An extended target-tracking approach is applied to properly exploit at the tracking stage the information related to extended nature of targets. The effectiveness of the proposed signal processing chain is assessed by numerical tests based on full-wave data pertaining to an indoor scenario.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2441957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7243393/07130594.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2441957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7243393","startPage":"6482","endPage":"6494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Extended Target Tracking for Through-Wall Radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Extended Target Tracking for Through-Wall Radars","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432865","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130594/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Extended Target Tracking for Through-Wall Radars","sourcePdf":"tgrs-soldovieri-2441957-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126191S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7243393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7243393","articleId":"7130594","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7130597,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China","Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Dependable Systems and Networks, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7447853/7130597/zhang-2448099-small.gif","p":["Wei Zhang received the BS degree in computer science from Hunan\n University, China, in 2011.

For privacy concerns, secure searches over encrypted cloud data has motivated several research works under the single owner model. However, most cloud servers in practice do not just serve one owner; instead, they support multiple owners to share the benefits brought by cloud computing. In this paper, we propose schemes to deal with privacy preserving ranked multi-keyword search in a multi-owner model (PRMSM). To enable cloud servers to perform secure search without knowing the actual data of both keywords and trapdoors, we systematically construct a novel secure search protocol. To rank the search results and preserve the privacy of relevance scores between keywords and files, we propose a novel additive order and privacy preserving function family. To prevent the attackers from eavesdropping secret keys and pretending to be legal data users submitting searches, we propose a novel dynamic secret key generation protocol and a new data user authentication protocol. Furthermore, PRMSM supports efficient data user revocation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm the efficacy and efficiency of PRMSM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130597/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 May 2016","accessionNumber":"15917833","htmlLink":"/document/7130597/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Privacy Preserving Ranked Multi-Keyword Search for Multiple Data Owners in Cloud Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61173038, 61472125 and 61300217"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"14JJ2051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy Preserving Ranked Multi-Keyword Search for Multiple Data Owners in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tc-zhang-2448099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149806S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7447853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7447853","articleId":"7130597","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7130601,"authors":[{"name":"Shelas Sathyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7293755/7130601/sathy-2448515-small.gif","p":["\n\nShelas Sathyan received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Government College of Engineering Kannur, Kerala, India, in 2009 and the M.Tech. degree in power electronics and drives from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology Nagpur, Nagpur, India, in 2012.

To achieve high voltage gain without large duty cycle operation, combination of coupled inductor and switched capacitor voltage doubler cells are used. By incorporating active clamp circuit, voltage spike due to the leakage inductance of the coupled inductor is alleviated and zero-voltage switching turn on of the main and auxiliary switch is obtained. Due to the use of MOSFETs of low voltage rating and soft turn on of the switches, conduction loss and switching losses are reduced. This improves the efficiency and power density of the converter. The proposed converter can achieve high voltage gain with reduced voltage stress on MOSFET switches and output diodes. Design and analysis of the proposed converter is carried out, and finally, a 500-W experimental prototype is built to verify theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130601/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"62","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15519492","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130601/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Soft-Switching DC\u2013DC Converter for Distributed Energy Sources With High Step-Up Voltage Capability","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Switching DC\u2013DC Converter for Distributed Energy Sources With High Step-Up Voltage Capability","sourcePdf":"tie-suryawanshi-2448515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082117S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7293755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"7293755","articleId":"7130601","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7130602,"authors":[{"name":"Mario J.

However, for constant-amplitude QAM modulation, such as quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK), only phase precoding is needed. We experimentally demonstrate 1-GBd vector signal generation at 12 GHz enabled by an MZM-based OSC modulation, adopting QPSK, 8 QAM, and 16 QAM modulation, respectively. We also experimentally compare the bit error rate performance of the three different vector signals, and the QPSK case is the best, while the 16 QAM case is the worst.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QAM Vector Signal Generation by Optical Carrier Suppression and Precoding Techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2015.2448517","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7210248/07130603.pdf","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2015.2448517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7210248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15, 15 2015","displayDocTitle":"QAM Vector Signal Generation by Optical Carrier Suppression and Precoding Techniques","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/7130603/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2015","publicationDate":"15 Sept.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15414177","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61325002 and 61250018"},{"fundingName":"Key Program through the Shanghai Science and Technology Association","grantNumber":"13JC1400700"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QAM Vector Signal Generation by Optical Carrier Suppression and Precoding Techniques","sourcePdf":"lpt-li-2448517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114851S","chronDate":"Sept.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7210248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7210248","articleId":"7130603","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7130604,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shaqfeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7182396/7130604/shaqf-2448082_print-small.gif","p":["\nMohammad Shaqfeh (S'07\u2013M'09) received the B.Sc. degree in \nelectrical engineering (communications stream) from the United Arab Emirates University in 2003, and the M.Sc. degree \nin communications technology from Ulm University in Germany in 2005.

To achieve this objective, we propose an opportunistic strategy to grant channel access to the primary and secondary sources based on the channel conditions in order to exploit the available multiple-link diversity gains in the system. The secondary source has causal knowledge of the primary messages and it acts as a relay of the primary source in return for getting access to the channel. To maximize the gains of relaying, the relay and destination are equipped with buffers to enable the use of channel-aware adaptive link selection. We propose and optimize different link selection policies and characterize their expected achievable rates. Also, we provide several numerical results to demonstrate the evident mutual benefits of buffer-aided cooperation and adaptive link selection to the primary and the secondary source-destination pairs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2448082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7182396/07130604.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2448082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182396","startPage":"2810","endPage":"2822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlay Cognitive Radios With Channel-Aware Adaptive Link Selection and Buffer-Aided Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Overlay Cognitive Radios With Channel-Aware Adaptive Link Selection and Buffer-Aided Relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130604/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15359415","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130604/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"05-401-2-161"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"5-250-2-087"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlay Cognitive Radios With Channel-Aware Adaptive Link Selection and Buffer-Aided Relaying","sourcePdf":"tcomm-shaqfeh-2448082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165447S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7182396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7182396","articleId":"7130604","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7130607,"authors":[{"name":"John Paul Ward","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group, \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, VD, Switzerland"],"firstName":"John Paul","lastName":"Ward","id":"38240773700"},{"name":"Pedram Pad","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group, \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, VD, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Pad","id":"37542191400"},{"name":"Michael Unser","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group, \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, VD, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Unser","id":"37284958500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7130607","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms","Wavelet analysis","Biomedical imaging","Calculus","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal representation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal isotropic mother wavelet","localized tight frame representations","spatial dimension","Euler-Lagrange equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calculus of variations","localization","Simoncelli wavelets","wavelet tight frames"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we aim to identify the optimal isotropic mother wavelet for a given spatial dimension based on a localization criterion.

In practice, DRAM retention times are normally distributed from 64 ms to several seconds. However, the conventional refresh method uses 64 ms as the refresh interval, since it applies the same refresh interval to all DRAM rows. Thus, the conventional refresh method results in unnecessary refresh operations (eventually, energy waste) to the DRAM rows whose retention times are longer than 64 ms. In this paper, we propose a practical refresh scheme that exploits refresh effect of DRAM read operations to reduce refresh overhead. Our proposed scheme applies a refresh interval longer than the conventional refresh interval (64 ms) to the DRAM chip. In this case, weak DRAM rows (DRAM rows whose retention times are shorter than the refresh interval of the DRAM chip) cannot retain their data. In order to retain the data stored in the weak DRAM rows, the memory controller issues read operations to the weak DRAM rows every required refresh interval for the weak DRAM rows. Our evaluation results show that our proposed scheme with 192 ms refresh interval reduces average refresh energy consumption up to 66.0 percent, which in turn reduces average DRAM energy consumption up to 31.8 percent, compared to the conventional refresh method (64 ms). Our proposed scheme requires no modification to internal DRAM chip structures, but it only adds a small weak row buffer (the buffer for the weak row information) to the memory controller, which has a negligible area overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130609/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","volume":"65","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15917851","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2016","publicationDate":"1 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7130609/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Refresh Effect of DRAM Read Operations: A Practical Approach to Low-Power Refresh","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korea government","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A2A1A11054390"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung Electronics"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002642","fundingName":"Korea University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Refresh Effect of DRAM Read Operations: A Practical Approach to Low-Power Refresh","sourcePdf":"tc-chung-2448079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067614S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7447853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7447853","articleId":"7130609","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7130610,"authors":[{"name":"Shang-Hsien Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7293755/7130610/syang-2448518-small.gif","p":["\n\nShang-Hsien Yang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

Despite years of active research, most of the past work focuses on uniprocessor systems. In this paper, we study the workload-aware temporal consistency maintenance problem upon multiprocessor platforms. We consider the problem of how to partition a set of update transactions to \n<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m \\ge 2$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n processors to maintain the temporal consistency of real-time data objects under both earliest deadline first (EDF) and deadline monotonic (DM) scheduling in each processor, while minimizing the total workload on \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n processors. Firstly, we only consider the feasibility aspect of the problem by proposing two polynomial time partitioning schemes, Temporal Consistency Partitioning under EDF (\n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf TCP_{\\mathsf{EDF}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>\n) and Temporal Consistency Partitioning under DM (\n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf TCP_{\\mathsf{DM}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>\n), and formally showing that the resource augmentation bounds of both \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf TCP_{\\mathsf{EDF}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf TCP_{\\mathsf{DM}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n are \n<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$({3 - \\frac{1}{m}})$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n. Secondly, we address the partition problem globally by proposing a polynomial time heuristic, Density factor Balancing Fit (\n<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{DBF}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n), where density factor balancing plays a major role in producing workload-efficient partitionings. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility and workload performances of \n<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{DBF}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n versus other heuristics with comparable quality experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2448088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7447853/07130614.pdf","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2448088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7447853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Consistency Maintenance Upon Partitioned Multiprocessor Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130614/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Consistency Maintenance Upon Partitioned Multiprocessor Platforms","volume":"65","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7130614/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science of China","grantNumber":"61332001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61173049 and 61300045"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M531696"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Consistency Maintenance Upon Partitioned Multiprocessor Platforms","sourcePdf":"tc-li-2448088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174002S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7447853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7447853","articleId":"7130614","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130617,"authors":[{"name":"Kia Filsoof","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7339495/7130617/filso-small.gif","p":["Kia Filsoof (S\u201908) received the B.A.Sc. degree in electronics\n engineering from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada, in 2011.

The modular structure of the MIMO-MMC enables efficient component utilization through module voltage and current sharing capabilities. The topology can supply or extract regulated power from an arbitrary number of controllable voltage nodes without requiring source or load multiplexing, resulting in minimized filtering requirements. The MIMO-MMC's structure is described, and the steady-state operation of the converter is theoretically analyzed. The dynamic models of the converter for both step-down and step-up configuration are derived and employed to devise an effective control algorithm for closed-loop operation. A general method is provided for stability analysis of the proposed closed-loop system followed by a case study verifying stability of the system at different operating points. The steady-state operation and dynamic response of the converter under both configurations is investigated through simulation and experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7339495/07130617.pdf","startPage":"2767","endPage":"2779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2448112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2448112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7339495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bidirectional Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Modular Multilevel DC\u2013DC Converter and its Control Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Voltage control","MIMO","Inductors","Mathematical model","Capacitors","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","DC-DC power convertors","dynamic response","MIMO systems","power system stability","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional multiple input multiple output modular multilevel DC-DC converter","MIMO-MMC","regulated power extraction","controllable voltage node","steady-state operation","dynamic model","step-up configuration","step-down configuration","effective control algorithm","closed loop control system design","stability analysis","dynamic response","power 100 W to 10 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dc-dc converter","bidirecitonal","multiple-input multiple-output","multiport","modular","multilevel"]},{"kwd":["Bidirectional","dc\u2013dc converter","modular","multilevel","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multiport"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Bidirectional Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Modular Multilevel DC\u2013DC Converter and its Control Design","volume":"31","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7130617/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15618489","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bidirectional Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Modular Multilevel DC\u2013DC Converter and its Control Design","sourcePdf":"tpel-filsoof-2448112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106897S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7339495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7339495","articleId":"7130617","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7130624,"authors":[{"name":"Daisuke Sugimura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7131605/7130624/sugim-2448356-small.gif","p":["Daisuke Sugimura (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in engineering science from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 2005, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in information science and technology from The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

In extremely low light scenes, heavy noise and motion blur are simultaneously produced in the captured images. Our goal is to enhance the color image sequence of an extremely low light scene. In this paper, we augment the imaging system as well as enhancing the image synthesis scheme. We propose a novel imaging system that can simultaneously capture the red, green, blue (RGB) and the NIR images with different exposure times. An RGB image is taken with a long exposure time to acquire sufficient color information and mitigates the effects of heavy noise. By contrast, the NIR images are captured with a short exposure time to measure the structure of the scenes. Our imaging system using different exposure times allows us to ensure sufficient information to reconstruct a clear color image sequence. Using the captured image pairs, we reconstruct a latent color image sequence using an adaptive smoothness condition based on gradient and color correlations. Our experiments using both synthetic images and real image sequences show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2448356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7131605/07130624.pdf","startPage":"3586","endPage":"3597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2448356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Color Images of Extremely Low Light Scenes Based on RGB/NIR Images Acquisition With Different Exposure Times","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130624/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Color Images of Extremely Low Light Scenes Based on RGB/NIR Images Acquisition With Different Exposure Times","volume":"24","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15284642","pubMedId":"26111392","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130624/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Color Images of Extremely Low Light Scenes Based on RGB/NIR Images Acquisition With Different Exposure Times","sourcePdf":"tip-sugimura-2448356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115624S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7131605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7131605","articleId":"7130624","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7130625,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7131605/7130625/sun-2448352-small.gif","p":["Jian Sun received the B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, in 2009.

Furthermore, to remove the splotchy real color noises, we design a Laplacian pyramid-based denoising framework to progressively recover the clean image from the coarsest scale to the finest scale by the DLIS model learned from the real color noises.

First, a new image feature called Normalized Pixel Difference (NPD) is proposed. NPD feature is computed as the difference to sum ratio between two pixel values, inspired by the Weber Fraction in experimental psychology. The new feature is scale invariant, bounded, and is able to reconstruct the original image. Second, we propose a deep quadratic tree to learn the optimal subset of NPD features and their combinations, so that complex face manifolds can be partitioned by the learned rules. This way, only a single soft-cascade classifier is needed to handle unconstrained face detection. Furthermore, we show that the NPD features can be efficiently obtained from a look up table, and the detection template can be easily scaled, making the proposed face detector very fast. Experimental results on three public face datasets (FDDB, GENKI, and CMU-MIT) show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting unconstrained faces with arbitrary pose variations and occlusions in cluttered scenes.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2448075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7374781/07130626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2448075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374781","startPage":"211","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast and Accurate Unconstrained Face Detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Fast and Accurate Unconstrained Face Detector","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15696940","pubMedId":"26761729","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7130626/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"#61203267"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Support Program","grantNumber":"#2013BAK02B01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006296","fundingName":"CAS Project","grantNumber":"#KGZD-EW-102-2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast and Accurate Unconstrained Face Detector","sourcePdf":"tpami-liao-2448075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094309S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7374781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"7374781","articleId":"7130626","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7130630,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Xian Ren","affiliation":["Intelligent Data Center (IDC) and Department of Mathematics, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7289487/7130630/ren-small.gif","p":["Chuan-Xian Ren (M\u201914) received the BS degree from Fuyang Normal\n University, Fuyang, China, in 2005, and the PhD degree from the Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2010.

However, noise and outliers usually attach to the data and then affect the real performance of leaning algorithms in data mining and pattern analysis. To address this problem, the importance of the sample itself in building the optimal subspace is explored, and then an importance-sampling-inspired method is proposed for outlier suppressing feature extraction. First, we assign each sample a weight, which is estimated by graph Laplacian, and then calculate the approximated mean for each subject. By highlighting the most subject-oriented samples, the weighted average and the scatter metrics can be measured with maximum margins and superior classification performance. The supervised information integrates local data structure with respective contributions to building the optimal subspace. The linear criterion can be extended to a nonlinear case by the kernel trick. A regularization framework is proposed to deal with the rank-deficient problem, which is usually induced by the small sample size of training set. Competitive performance of our algorithm has been validated by extensive experiments performed on the synthetic and benchmark data, including facial images and gene micro-array data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Kernel","Optical wavelength conversion","Training","Estimation","Buildings","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","data mining","data structures","feature extraction","graph theory","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample weighting","outlier","discriminant analysis","data acquirement technologies","data mining","pattern analysis","importance-sampling-inspired method","feature extraction","graph Laplacian","approximated mean","weighted average","scatter metrics","maximum margins","classification performance","local data structure","linear criterion","kernel trick","regularization framework","rank-deficient problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discriminant analysis","Sample weighting","Importance sampling","Feature extraction","Regularization"]},{"kwd":["Discriminant analysis","sample weighting","importance sampling","feature extraction","regularization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2015.2448547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/7289487/07130630.pdf","startPage":"3070","endPage":"3083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7289487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2015.2448547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample Weighting: An Inherent Approach for Outlier Suppressing Discriminant Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sample Weighting: An Inherent Approach for Outlier Suppressing Discriminant Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130630/","volume":"27","issue":"11","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130630/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15539843","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203248, 61375033, 61403164, 61233011 and 11171354"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002338","fundingName":"Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"SRFDP-20120171120007 and 20120171110016"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"S2013020012796"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"13lgpy26"},{"fundingName":"Open Project Program of the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample Weighting: An Inherent Approach for Outlier Suppressing Discriminant Analysis","sourcePdf":"tkde-dai-2448547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144612S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7289487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7289487","articleId":"7130630","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7130633,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqing Chao","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7492215/7130633/chao-2442256-small.gif","p":["Guoqing Chao received the B.S. degree from Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang, China, in 2009.

We name the new MVMED framework as alternative MVMED (AMVMED), which enforces the posteriors of two view margins to be equal. The proposed AMVMED is more flexible than the existing MVMED, because compared with MVMED, which optimizes one relative entropy, AMVMED assigns one relative entropy term to each of the two views, thus incorporating a tradeoff between the two views. We give the detailed solving procedure, which can be divided into two steps. The first step is solving our optimization problem without considering the equal margin posteriors from two views, and then, in the second step, we consider the equal posteriors. Experimental results on multiple real-world data sets verify the effectiveness of the AMVMED, and comparisons with MVMED are also reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16073170","pubMedId":"26111403","volume":"27","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7130633/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Alternative Multiview Maximum Entropy Discrimination","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370175"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Knowledge Service Platform","grantNumber":"ZF1213"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"14DZ2260800"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternative Multiview Maximum Entropy Discrimination","sourcePdf":"tnnls-chao-2442256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085343S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7492215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7492215","articleId":"7130633","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7130642,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7449033/7130642/xue-2448095-li-small.gif","p":["Wei Li received the BS degree from the Department of Information\n Security, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), in 2014.

The earlier ABE schemes involve only one authority to maintain the whole attribute set, which can bring a single-point bottleneck on both security and performance. Subsequently, some multi-authority schemes are proposed, in which multiple authorities separately maintain disjoint attribute subsets. However, the single-point bottleneck problem remains unsolved. In this paper, from another perspective, we conduct a threshold multi-authority CP-ABE access control scheme for public cloud storage, named TMACS, in which multiple authorities jointly manage a uniform attribute set. In TMACS, taking advantage of (\n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t,n$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n) threshold secret sharing, the master key can be shared among multiple authorities, and a legal user can generate his/her secret key by interacting with any \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n authorities. Security and performance analysis results show that TMACS is not only verifiable secure when less than \n<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n authorities are compromised, but also robust when no less than \n<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n authorities are alive in the system. Furthermore, by efficiently combining the traditional multi-authority scheme with TMACS, we construct a hybrid one, which satisfies the scenario of attributes coming from different authorities as well as achieving security and system-level robustness.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TMACS: A Robust and Verifiable Threshold Multi-Authority Access Control System in Public Cloud

consumption, high density, and fault tolerance. However, their implementation is still hindered by the limitations of CMOS neuron and learning cells. In this paper, we present a memristor-based NC that implements on-chip supervised learning. Instead of using a standard CMOS neuron, a simple CMOS inverter realizes the activation function. More importantly, we propose a compact learning cell that consists of a crossbar latch of two antiparallel oriented binary memristors. This design allows for higher density integration and could be naturally extended to a multilayer neural network. Using the CMOS 40-nm design kit and a physics-based compact model of high-performance ferroelectric tunnel memristor, we performed transient simulations to validate the function of the proposed neural crossbar. Then, we construct a multilayer NC by cascading monolayer networks; thereby, enabling the network to learn nonlinearly separable functions (e.g., XOR function). Finally, the fault tolerance is evaluated with Monte Carlo simulation. Analysis of simulation results demonstrates promising applications of our proposed neural crossbar for on-chip supervised learning.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2015.2448554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/7322313/07130643.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2015.2448554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrahigh Density Memristor Neural Crossbar for On-Chip Supervised Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Ultrahigh Density Memristor Neural Crossbar for On-Chip Supervised Learning","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587680","htmlLink":"/document/7130643/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Projects ANR-MOOREA and ANR-MARS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrahigh Density Memristor Neural Crossbar for On-Chip Supervised Learning","sourcePdf":"tnano-chabi-2448554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112387S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7322313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7322313","articleId":"7130643","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130647,"authors":[{"name":"Su Y.

The cross section of the core has a thin S-shape, and a vertically-wound multiturn coil is displaced inside the core. In this way, the most slim power supply rail is designed, which is crucial for the commercialization of RPEVs. The construction of roadway infrastructure, which is responsible for more than 80% of the total deployment cost for RPEVs, can be much easier when the width of the power supply rail is so small. To increase portability and to minimize construction time, a foldable power supply module is also proposed in which flexible power cables connect each foldable power supply module such that no connectors are needed during deployment. An effective winding method for minimizing the cable length is proposed, and an optimum core thickness of the proposed power supply rail is determined by FEA simulations and verified by a prototype power supply module. By virtue of the ultraslim shape, a large lateral displacement of 30 cm at an air gap of 20 cm was experimentally obtained, which is 6 cm larger than that of the I-type power supply rail. In addition to the larger lateral displacement, it is estimated that the S-type one has lower EMF than the I-type one because the width of the S-type one is narrower than that of I-type one. The maximum efficiency, excluding the inverter, was 91%, and the pick-up power was 22 kW.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2444894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7154538/07130647.pdf","startPage":"6456","endPage":"6468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2444894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7154538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultraslim S-Type Power Supply Rails for Roadway-Powered Electric Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130647/","displayDocTitle":"Ultraslim S-Type Power Supply Rails for Roadway-Powered Electric Vehicles","volume":"30","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15289504","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130647/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Center for 3I Innovative Power Reactor, Department of Nuclear and Quantum Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"20121610100030"},{"fundingName":"Nuclear Power Core Technology Development Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003052","fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea","grantNumber":"21A20130012538"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultraslim S-Type Power Supply Rails for Roadway-Powered Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tpel-choi-2444894-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11132S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7154538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7154538","articleId":"7130647","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7130650,"authors":[{"name":"Ruwan B.

The cost function associated with such tasks is often highly complex, hence in most cases only an approximate solution is obtained by evaluating the cost function on discrete locations in the parameter (hypothesis) space. To be successful at least one hypothesis has to be in the vicinity of the solution. Due to noise hypotheses generated by minimal subsets can be far from the underlying model, even when the samples are from the said structure. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using higher than minimal subset sampling for hypothesis generation. Our empirical studies showed that increasing the sample size beyond minimal size (p), in particular up to p + 2, will significantly increase the probability of generating a hypothesis closer to the true model when subsets are selected from inliers. On the other hand, the probability of selecting an all inlier sample rapidly decreases with the sample size, making direct extension of existing methods unfeasible. Hence, we propose a new computationally tractable method for robust model fitting that uses higher than minimal subsets. Here, one starts from an arbitrary hypothesis (which does not need to be in the vicinity of the solution) and moves until either a structure in data is found or the process is re-initialized. The method also has the ability to identify when the algorithm has reached a hypothesis with adequate accuracy and stops appropriately, thereby saving computational time. The experimental analysis carried out using synthetic and real data shows that the proposed method is both accurate and efficient compared to the state-of-the-art robust model fitting techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Cost function","Data models","Estimation error","Noise","Robustness","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust model fitting","subset sampling","minimal subset sampling","noise hypotheses","hypothesis generation","data structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model fitting","Robust Statistics","hypothesis generation","data segmentation","higher than minimal subset sampling"]},{"kwd":["Model fitting","robust statistics","hypothesis generation","data segmentation","higher than minimal subset sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2448103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7374781/07130650.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2448103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Model Fitting Using Higher Than Minimal Subset Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Model Fitting Using Higher Than Minimal Subset Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130650/","volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130650/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15696943","pubMedId":"26761739","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000163","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Model Fitting Using Higher Than Minimal Subset Sampling","sourcePdf":"tpami-tennakoon-2448103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081934S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7374781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7374781","articleId":"7130650","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7130653,"authors":[{"name":"Bei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7456360/7130653/zhang-2437911-small.gif","p":["Bei Zhang (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

More than four decades after it was first proposed, the seminal error reduction algorithm of Gerchberg and Saxton and Fienup is still the popular choice for solving many variants of this problem. The algorithm is based on alternating minimization; i.e., it alternates between estimating the missing phase information, and the candidate solution. Despite its wide usage in practice, no global convergence guarantees for this algorithm are known. In this paper, we show that a (resampling) variant of this approach converges geometrically to the solution of one such problem-finding a vector x from y, A, where y = |A\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sup>\nx| and |z| denotes a vector of element-wise magnitudes of z-under the assumption that A is Gaussian. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternating minimization performs similar to recently proposed convex techniques for this problem (which are based on \u201clifting\u201d to a convex matrix problem) in sample complexity and robustness to noise. However, it is much more efficient and can scale to large problems. Analytically, for a resampling version of alternating minimization, we show geometric convergence to the solution, and sample complexity that is off by log factors from obvious lower bounds. We also establish close to optimal scaling for the case when the unknown vector is sparse. Our work represents the first theoretical guarantee for alternating minimization (albeit with resampling) for any variant of phase retrieval problems in the non-convex setting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2015","volume":"63","issue":"18","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15364445","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130654/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Phase Retrieval Using Alternating Minimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000083","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1302435 and 0954059"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Retrieval Using Alternating Minimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-netrapalli-2448516-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198873S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7182811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"7182811","articleId":"7130654","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7130657,"authors":[{"name":"David Morales-Jimenez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Honk Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7182811/7130657/7130657-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Morales-Jimenez received the Telecommunication Engineering degree from the University of Malaga (Spain) in 2006, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Telecommunication Technologies from the same University in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, we consider an MIMO multicell system where multiple mobile users (MUs) ask for computation offloading to a common cloud server. We formulate the offloading problem as the joint optimization of the radio resources-the transmit precoding matrices of the MUs-and the computational resources-the CPU cycles/second assigned by the cloud to each MU-in order to minimize the overall users' energy consumption, while meeting latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is nonconvex (in the objective function and constraints). Nevertheless, in the single-user case, we are able to compute the global optimal solution in closed form. In the more challenging multiuser scenario, we propose an iterative algorithm, based on a novel successive convex approximation technique, converging to a local optimal solution of the original nonconvex problem. We then show that the proposed algorithmic framework naturally leads to a distributed and parallel implementation across the radio access points, requiring only a limited coordination/signaling with the cloud. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes outperform disjoint optimization algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSIPN.2015.2448520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSIPN.2015.2448520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6884276/7229412/07130662.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimization of Radio and Computational Resources for Multicell Mobile-Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization of Radio and Computational Resources for Multicell Mobile-Edge Computing","volume":"1","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130662/","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417266","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130662/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Community 7th Framework Programme","grantNumber":"318784"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100003187","fundingName":"USA NSF","grantNumber":"CMS 1218717 and 1254739"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization of Radio and Computational Resources for Multicell Mobile-Edge Computing","sourcePdf":"tsipn-sardellitti-2448520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139634S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6884276","isNumber":"7229412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6884276","citationCount":"530","xplore-issue":"7229412","articleId":"7130662","onlineDate":"22 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7130666,"authors":[{"name":"Janne Koivum\u00e4ki","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Hydraulics and Automation, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/7177171/7130666/koivu-small.gif","p":["Janne Koivum\u00e4ki received the B.Sc. and M.Sc.

As a significant novelty, the end-effector contact force is directly estimated from the manipulator's cylinder pressure data, which provides a practical solution for heavy-duty contact force control without engaging fragile force/torque sensors. In the experiments, the proposed controller achieved a force control accuracy of 4.1% at a desired contact force of 8000 N while in motion.

According to the standard framework, stochastic circuit waveforms are still expressed as expansions of orthonormal polynomials.

As discussed throughout the letter, the proposed technique overcomes several limitations of state-of-the-art methods.

A primary concern in designing these applications is to combat harsh indoor propagation environments, particularly Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) propagation. The ability to identify the existence of the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) path acts as a key enabler for adaptive communication, cognitive radios, and robust localization. Enabling such capability on commodity WiFi infrastructure, however, is prohibitive due to the coarse multipath resolution with MAC-layer received signal strength. In this paper, we propose two PHY-layer channel-statistics-based features from both the time and frequency domains. To further break away from the intrinsic bandwidth limit of WiFi, we extend to the spatial domain and harness natural mobility to magnify the randomness of NLOS paths while retaining the deterministic nature of the LOS component. We propose LiFi, a statistical LOS identification scheme with commodity WiFi infrastructure, and evaluate it in typical indoor environments covering an area of 1500 m \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. Experimental results demonstrate that LiFi achieves an overall LOS detection rate of 90.42% with a false alarm rate of 9.34% for the temporal feature and an overall LOS detection rate of 93.09% with a false alarm rate of 7.29% for the spectral feature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Delays","Feature extraction","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Mobile

Those were very exciting times, particularly the day I found that I could build DRAM with just a single transistor and a capacitor. I wrote an internal paper and obtained a patent, but the first chance I had to work much on my idea came about four years later when the small team I worked with was challenged to make DRAM 25 times denser by reducing the layout dimensions from 5 ?m to 1 ?m. That is when we developed the scaling principles and showed how well they worked by building some experimental MOS transistors scaled to small dimensions. The progress in DRAM and all microelectronic devices and circuits has been amazingly successful since those first scaling principles were introduced. Many challenges have been met to achieve this, but today even more challenges have to be faced if progress is to continue.","doi":"10.1109/MSSC.2014.2385965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSSC.2014.2385965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563670/7130723/07130781.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Past Progress and Future Challenges in LSI Technology: From DRAM and Scaling to Ultra-Low-Power CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Past Progress and Future Challenges in LSI Technology: From DRAM and Scaling to Ultra-Low-Power CMOS","volume":"7","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Spring  2015","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130781/","publicationDate":"Spring 2015","accessionNumber":"15250597","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130781/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Past Progress and Future Challenges in LSI Technology: From DRAM and Scaling to Ultra-Low-Power CMOS","sourcePdf":"07mssc02-dennard-2385965-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038647S","chronDate":"Spring  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563670","isNumber":"7130723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7130723","articleId":"7130781","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7130863,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Bahrami","affiliation":["Cloud Lab Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Merced, USA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bahrami","id":"37085426002"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7130863","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10727},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130863","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Tutorials","Computer architecture","Industries","Conferences","Big data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","mobile computing","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud software architecture","mobile cloud computing","mobile cloud application design","network apps","application designing tools","application migration","mobile cloud services","mobile cloud computing architecture","application-design industry","privacy issues","security issues","mobile cloud vendor services","mobile application business improvement","Microsoft Windows Azure","Amazon AWS","Google Cloud Platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile App Design; Mobile Cloud Computing; Cloud Architecture; Mobile Security; Mobile Privacy"]}],"abstract":"The tutorial will begin with an explanation of the concepts behind cloud computing systems, cloud software architecture, the need for mobile cloud computing as an aspect of the app industry to deal with new mobile app design, network apps, app designing tools, and the motivation for migrating apps to cloud computing systems.

Remote execution leverages the high computation capacity of the server to enrich user experience and extend battery autonomy through energy savings. However, application offloading is energy efficient only under various conditions. For that purpose, we propose an original algorithm called MAO(Mobile Application's Offloading) triggered by two conditions: The current CPU load and State of Charge (SoC) of the battery.On the basis of various traffic scenarios mixing interactive and delay tolerant mobile applications, we study through numerical simulations the efficiency of the MAO algorithm and assess its performance in terms of rejected jobs and the amount of energy savings achieved. Rejected jobs are those unable to meet user quality of experience (QoE) and/or energy efficiency requirements. Evaluations on simulated workloads show that both traffic loads and user's radio mobile environment have direct impact on the efficiency of the MAO algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mobile Application Offloading Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.11","startPage":"34","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130853","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128083/7130853/07130867.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Mobile Application Offloading Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130867/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15241032","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mobile Application Offloading Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8977a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082966S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128083","isNumber":"7130853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128083","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7130853","articleId":"7130867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130869,"authors":[{"name":"Heungsik Eom","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Heungsik","lastName":"Eom","id":"37085452990"},{"name":"Renato Figueiredo","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Figueiredo","id":"37085473649"},{"name":"Huaqian Cai","affiliation":["Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huaqian","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085469296"},{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310452400"},{"name":"Gang Huang","affiliation":["Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37274328100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7130869","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":935},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Mobile communication","Runtime","Processor scheduling","Accuracy","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Java","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","pattern classification","scheduling","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning-based mobile offloading scheduler","online training","MALMOS","online machine learning techniques","application-dependent parameters","static scheduling policies","online training mechanism","machine learning-based runtime scheduler","flexible policy","Java-based offloading-capable code refactoring framework","DPartner","instance-based learning","perceptron","naive Bayes","classifier training time","classification time","scheduling accuracy","static scheduling cases","threshold-based scheduling policies","linear equation-based scheduling policies","Android-based prototype"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile platform","computation offloading","machine learning","runtime scheduler","online training"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes and evaluates MALMOS, a novel framework for mobile offloading scheduling based on online machine learning techniques. In contrast to previous works, which rely on application-dependent parameters or predefined static scheduling policies, MALMOS provides an online training mechanism for the machine learning-based runtime scheduler such that it supports a flexible policy that dynamically adapts scheduling decisions based on the observation of previous offloading decisions and their correctness. To demonstrate its practical applicability, we integrated MALMOS with an existing Java-based, offloading-capable code recapturing framework, Partner. Using this integration, we performed quantitative experiments to evaluate the performance and cost for three machine learning algorithms: instance-based learning, perception, and naive Bays, with respect to classifier training time, classification time, and scheduling accuracy. Particularly, we examined the adaptability of MALMOS to various network conditions and computing capabilities of remote resources by comparing the scheduling accuracy with two static scheduling cases: threshold-based and linear equation-based scheduling policies. Our evaluation uses an Android-based prototype for experiments, and considers benchmarks with different computation/communication characteristics, and different computing capabilities of remote resources. The evaluation shows that MALMOS achieves 10.9%~40.5% higher scheduling accuracy than two static scheduling policies.","doi":"10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.19","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128083/7130853/07130869.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130853","startPage":"51","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MALMOS: Machine Learning-Based Mobile Offloading Scheduler with Online Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MALMOS: Machine Learning-Based Mobile Offloading Scheduler with Online Training","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130869/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15241031","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130869/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MALMOS: Machine Learning-Based Mobile Offloading Scheduler with Online Training","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8977a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05239S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128083","isNumber":"7130853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128083","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7130853","articleId":"7130869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130871,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Yuan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High-Confidence Software Technologies (Ministry of Education), Peking University"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085570971"},{"name":"Yao Guo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High-Confidence Software Technologies (Ministry of Education), Peking University"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277881100"},{"name":"Xiangqun Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High-Confidence Software Technologies (Ministry of Education), Peking University"],"firstName":"Xiangqun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278212300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7130871","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Data models","Synchronization","Computer architecture","Smart phones","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android (operating system)","cloud computing","iOS (operating system)","mobile computing","mobile handsets","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PMD","computing devices","mobile cloud applications","MCA","mobile platforms","model-view-controller pattern","MVC","mobile applications","iOS","Android","Windows Phone","energy consumption","personal mobile devices","mobile cloud computing","uniform programming support framework","uniport"]}],"abstract":"Personal mobile devices (PMDs) have become the most used computing devices for many people. With the introduction of mobile cloud computing, we can augment the storage and computing capabilities of PMDs via cloud support. However, there are many challenges in developing mobile cloud applications (MCAs) that incorporate cloud computing efficiently, especially for developers targeting multiple mobile platforms. This paper presents Uniport, a uniform framework for developing MCAs. We introduce a uniform architecture for MCAs based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and a set of programming primitives and runtime libraries. Not only can Uniport support the creation of new MCAs, it can also help transform existing mobile applications to MCAs efficiently. We demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of Uniport in a case study to transform three existing mobile applications on iOS, Android and Windows Phone, to their mobile cloud versions respectively. Evaluation results show that, with very few modifications, we can easily transform mobile applications to MCAs that can exploit the cloud support to improve performance by 3 - 7x and save more than half of their energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.10","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128083/7130853/07130871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130853","startPage":"71","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniport: A Uniform Programming Support Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uniport: A Uniform Programming Support Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130871/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15241027","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7130871/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniport: A Uniform Programming Support Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8977a071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112444S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128083","isNumber":"7130853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128083","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7130853","articleId":"7130871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130880,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Borcea","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, US"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Borcea"},{"name":"Xiaoning Ding","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoning","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085402480"},{"name":"Narain Gehani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey, USA"],"firstName":"Narain","lastName":"Gehani","id":"37085408753"},{"name":"Reza Curtmola","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Curtmola","id":"37541094400"},{"name":"Mohammad A Khan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad A","lastName":"Khan","id":"38252479300"},{"name":"Hillol Debnath","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey, USA"],"firstName":"Hillol","lastName":"Debnath","id":"37085401045"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7130880","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":463},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Avatars","Mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Computer architecture","Privacy","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android (operating system)","avatars","cloud computing","data privacy","energy consumption","middleware","mobile computing","power aware computing","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud resources","energy efficient distributed computing","mobile devices","per-user software entity","resource isolation","unmodified app components","avatar system","high-level programming model","middleware","distributed applications","cloud architecture","mobile users","mobile application","cloud workloads","avatar prototype","Android devices","operating system","Android x86 virtual machines","privacy guarantees"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile distributed computing","smart phones","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Avatar is a system that leverages cloud resources to support fast, scalable, reliable, and energy efficient distributed computing over mobile devices. An avatar is a per-user software entity in the cloud that runs apps on behalf of the user's mobile devices. The avatars are instantiated as virtual machines in the cloud that run the same operating system with the mobile devices. In this way, avatars provide resource isolation and execute unmodified app components, which simplifies technology adoption. Avatar apps execute over distributed and synchronized (mobile device, avatar) pairs to achieve a global goal. The three main challenges that must be overcome by the Avatar system are: creating a high-level programming model and a middleware that enable effective execution of distributed applications on a combination of mobile devices and avatars, re-designing the cloud architecture and protocols to support billions of mobile users and mobile apps with very different characteristics from the current cloud workloads, and explore new approaches that balance privacy guarantees with app efficiency/usability. We have built a basic Avatar prototype on Android devices and Android x86 virtual machines. An application that searches for a lost child by analyzing the photos taken by people at a crowded public event runs on top of this prototype.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Avatar: Mobile Distributed Computing in the Cloud","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128083/7130853/07130880.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Avatar: Mobile Distributed Computing in the Cloud","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130880/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15241030","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avatar: Mobile Distributed Computing in the Cloud","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8977a151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051125S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128083","isNumber":"7130853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128083","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7130853","articleId":"7130880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130881,"authors":[{"name":"Saeid Abolfazli","affiliation":["YTL Communications and Xchanging, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Abolfazli","id":"38488502500"},{"name":"Abdullah Gani","affiliation":["YTL Communications and Xchanging, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Gani","id":"37682537100"},{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["Center for Mobile Cloud Computing, University of Malaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407022500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7130881","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Mathematical model","Mobile handsets","Scalability","Computational modeling","Performance evaluation","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","energy conservation","mobile computing","performance evaluation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HMCC","hybrid mobile cloud computing framework","mobile computation outsourcing model","hybrid granular cloud-based resources","fine-grained resources","coarse-grained resources","medium-grained resources","wireless networks","wired networks","augment mobile devices","cloud-connected compute-intensive mobile applications","CiMA","HMCC","performance evaluation","round-trip time","energy saving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile cloud computing","cloud-based mobile augmentation","heterogeneity"]}],"abstract":"Hybrid Mobile Cloud Computing (HMCC) refers to a Mobile Computation Outsourcing (MCO) model that exploits hybrid granular cloud-based resources composed of coarse-, medium-, and fine-grained resources interconnected by wireless and wired networks to augment mobile devices.

Many existing research has proposed to offload computation tasks from mobile devices to clouds in order to reduce energy consumption, where the offloading service model is usually one-to-one. Due to the development of mobile sensing and location-based mobile cloud services, the cloud edge has been extended to the mobile devices and sensors. As a result, the one-to-one model is not sufficient to model the dynamic changes of mobile cloud-based services. Thus, a many-to-many (or multi-site) mobile cloud service composition is highly desired. In this research, MoSeC is presented to model the many-to-many mobile cloud service composition, where there are multiple surrogates, such as cloud computing nodes, mobile devices, or sensors, and their services (i.e., computation, storage, sensing, etc.) can be composed to fulfill functions required by a mobile service requestor. MoSeC takes into considerations the surrogates' changes due to their mobility and resource constraints. Moreover, MoSeC takes into considerations several service metrics for service mapping (or allocation) through a mobile cloud service topology reconfiguration process. A set of algorithms are presented to address the Service Topology Reconfiguration Problem (STRP) in several mobile cloud representative application scenarios, i.e., they are modeled as finite horizon scenarios, infinite horizon scenarios, and large state space scenarios to represent ad hoc, long-term, and large-scale mobile cloud service composition scenarios, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128083/7130853/07130884.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"182","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MoSeC: Mobile-Cloud Service Composition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Mobile communication","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","infinite horizon","mobile computing","storage allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MoSeC","mobile cloud computing","mobile device","mobile sensing","location-based mobile cloud service","cloud edge","mobile service requestor","mobile cloud service topology reconfiguration process","service topology reconfiguration problem","STRP","infinite horizon","large state space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"MoSeC: Mobile-Cloud Service Composition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130884/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15241026","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MoSeC: Mobile-Cloud Service Composition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8977a177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062056S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128083","isNumber":"7130853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128083","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7130853","articleId":"7130884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130885,"authors":[{"name":"Ragib Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Ragib","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37419422100"},{"name":"Md.

With billions of such devices slated to be deployed in the next five years, we have the opportunity to utilize these devices in converting our physical environment into interactive, smart, and intelligent computing infrastructures. In this paper, we present Aura -- a highly localized IoT based cloud computing model. Aura allows clients to create ad hoc clouds using the IoT and other computing devices in the nearby physical environment, while providing the flexibility of cloud computing. Aura provides localized computation capability from untapped computing resources. Computations done on Aura are highly flexible, giving clients full control to start, stop, migrate, and restart computations in nearby devices as the clients move between different physical locations. To demonstrate the feasibility of Aura, we have ported a lightweight version of MapReduce to run on IoT devices, and evaluated its performance.","doi":"10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.37","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128083/7130853/07130885.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aura: An IoT Based Cloud Infrastructure for Localized Mobile Computation Outsourcing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130885/","displayDocTitle":"Aura: An IoT Based Cloud Infrastructure for Localized Mobile Computation Outsourcing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15241017","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130885/","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aura: An IoT Based Cloud Infrastructure for Localized Mobile Computation Outsourcing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8977a183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053731S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128083","isNumber":"7130853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128083","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7130853","articleId":"7130885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130886,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Bahrami","affiliation":["Cloud Lab University of California, Merced, USA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bahrami","id":"37085426002"},{"name":"Mukesh Singhal","affiliation":["Cloud Lab University of California, Merced, USA"],"firstName":"Mukesh","lastName":"Singhal","id":"37271719500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7130886","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":607},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Encryption","Cloud computing","Chaos","Data privacy","Mobile communication","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","cryptography","data privacy","image coding","mobile computing","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light-weight permutation based method","data privacy","mobile cloud computing","cloud computing paradigm","virtual IT infrastructures","cloud vendor","vendor authorized users","cloud users","unauthorized users","external malicious entities","privacy maintain","cloud-stored data","encryption methods","mobile devices","light-weight method","mobile clients","JPEG image format","encryption methods","AES","JPEG encoders","data privacy","security attack scenarios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Cloud Computing","Privacy","Permutation","Data storage","JPEG encryption","Chaos System"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing paradigm provides virtual IT infrastructures with a set of resources that are shared with multi-tenant users. Data Privacy is one of the major challenges when users outsource their data to a cloud computing system. Privacy can be violated by the cloud vendor, vendor's authorized users, other cloud users, unauthorized users, or external malicious entities. Encryption is one of the solutions to protect and maintain privacy of cloud-stored data. However, encryption methods are complex and expensive for mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a new light-weight method for mobile clients to store data on one or multiple clouds by using pseudo-random permutation based on chaos systems. The proposed method can be used in the client mobile devices to store data in the cloud(s) without using cloud computing resources for encryption to maintain user's privacy. We consider JPEG image format as a case study to present and evaluate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieve superior performance compared to over encryption methods, such as AES and encryption on JPEG encoders while protecting the mobile user data privacy. We review major security attack scenarios against the proposed method that shows the level of security.","doi":"10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.36","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128083/7130853/07130886.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Light-Weight Permutation Based Method for Data Privacy in Mobile Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130886/","displayDocTitle":"A Light-Weight Permutation Based Method for Data Privacy in Mobile Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15241016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130886/","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Light-Weight Permutation Based Method for Data Privacy in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8977a189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058003S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128083","isNumber":"7130853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128083","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7130853","articleId":"7130886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130887,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Aceto","affiliation":["Reykjavik University, Iceland"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Aceto","id":"37085388590"},{"name":"Andrea Morichetta","affiliation":["IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Morichetta","id":"37085389047"},{"name":"Francesco Tiezzi","affiliation":["University of Camerino, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Tiezzi","id":"37085372384"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7130887","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Batteries","Runtime","Computational modeling","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automata theory","cloud computing","formal specification","formal verification","mobile computing","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision support","mobile cloud computing applications","runtime support","offloading decisions","formal framework","MobiCa domain specific language","system structure","application structure","diagnostic trace","UPPAAL model checker","query verification","timed automata model","MobiCa specification","application fragments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["code offloading","decision support","energy saving","model checking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130887","abstract":"Deciding whether to off load some computation is a crucial issue in Mobile Cloud Computing systems. This paper proposes a new methodology, whose goal is to provide runtime support for off loading decisions, based on a formal framework.

Using the diagnostic trace generated at runtime by the well-known model checker UPPAAL, driven by some query verified on the timed automata model associated with the MobiCa specification, the framework decides which application fragments should be remotely executed. The proposed approach is exemplified on a navigator case study, probably one of the most used applications on mobile devices.","doi":"10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.21","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128083/7130853/07130887.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision Support for Mobile Cloud Computing Applications via Model Checking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"Decision Support for Mobile Cloud Computing Applications via Model Checking","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130887/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15241019","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision Support for Mobile Cloud Computing Applications via Model Checking","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8977a199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047681S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128083","isNumber":"7130853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128083","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7130853","articleId":"7130887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130892,"authors":[{"name":"Noriyuki Takahashi","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277509600"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Tanaka","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37405567100"},{"name":"Ryutaro Kawamura","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryutaro","lastName":"Kawamura","id":"37085492294"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8977-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7130892","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1057},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Mobile communication","Delays","Cloud computing","Educational Activities Board","Acceleration","Browsers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet","mobile computing","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process assignment analysis","multitier mobile cloud computing","edge accelerated Web browsing","small IT servers","processing delay","battery usage","application execution abstract model","performance metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile cloud computing","mobile edge computing","cloudlet","web acceleration"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses \"multi-tier mobile cloud computing\" architecture, where small IT servers in users' proximity are utilized to execute a part of application processing.

We assume a multicarrier transmission for both the primary and secondary systems. Instead of optimizing the powers over all sub-carriers, the sub-carriers are grouped into clusters of sub-carriers, where the power of each sub-carrier is directly related to the power of the correspondent cluster. The power optimization is done only over the set of clusters instead of all sub-carriers which can significantly reduce the complexity of the resource allocation problem. The performance loss of the reduced dimension solution with respect to the optimal solution, where the optimization is carried over all active sub-carriers, allows trading-off complexity versus performance. Numerical evaluation indeed revealed that a limited performance loss occurs by optimizing over a reduced set of clusters instead of the full optimization in the context of cognitive radio systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130897/","xploreNote":"The IEEE is incorrectly listed as the copyright holder for this conference proceedings.

In an environment with multiple transmitters the emitters may transmit independent waveform or use a coding structure to emit pulses across antennas over a predetermined coherent time-interval. In this work we extend the principles of employing orthogonal block codes for this purpose and emphasize on arbitrary or randomly designed block codes with a compressed sensing based detection at receiver. By employing a compressed sensing approach only a subset of incoming data needs to be stored and processed thus significantly reducing the sampling and integration requirement at the receivers. We show that the use of more general type of block codes allows for greater flexibility and better performance in target detection and are hence more suitable for compressed sensing methods than orthogonal, or quasi-orthogonal, block codes. Through simulations it is validated that such a system can operate well and compressed sensing techniques allow for data reduction and improved detection with a shorter dwell period.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7130969","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07130969.pdf","startPage":"0051","endPage":"0055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7130969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing for Multistatic Radar Systems with Arbitrary Block Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130969/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing for Multistatic Radar Systems with Arbitrary Block Codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240202","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130969/","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing for Multistatic Radar Systems with Arbitrary Block Codes","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089676S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7130969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7130970,"authors":[{"name":"Shanna Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Shanna Zhuang","id":"38232158300"},{"name":"Zhengyou Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Zhengyou Wang","id":"37085352588"},{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Hui Wang","id":"37085443758"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7130970","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method combining waveform optimization with radar cross section (RCS) estimation to improve the range-angle imaging performance for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar.

The above process is repeated for each range-angle bin in the target scene. Therefore, all RCSs in the target scene could be estimated more precisely, consequently improving imaging performance.

We extend previous work where a novel estimation and information theoretic bound formulation was constructed for a receiver that observes communications and radar returns in the same frequency allocation. While the previous work derived a joint performance bound in terms of the communications rate and the target delay estimation rate of the system for pulsed waveforms, we derive a similar bound for FMCW radar and include Doppler estimation.

But, despite many advantages compared to other algorithms, GBP usage is limited. It requires significant computational complexity and consumes more power. This paper presents a high-performance architecture which allows efficient and scalable implementation of the GBP algorithm on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Such an architecture is based on a systolic array that performs back-projection in a pipelined way, using parallelism over image pixels and radar pulses. A GBP systolic array is built using specially designed back-projection streaming cores. The cores utilize a floating-point calculation on the FPGA to achieve accurate and high-dynamic range in GBP integration. Results presented herein, show the achieved performance of GBP-based image formation using an FPGA and details the power consumption of the described implementation. Comparison is made to other computational platforms in order to determine advantage for real-time and power constrained SAR applications and platforms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Arrays","Apertures","Radar imaging","Synthetic aperture radar","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global back-projection algorithm","FPGA","synthetic aperture radar image formation","GBP usage","field programmable gate array","GBP systolic array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Aperture Radar","SAR","Back-Projection Algorithm","Image Formation","FPGA","GPU","Floating-Point"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7130996","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7130996","startPage":"0204","endPage":"0209","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07130996.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7130996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130996/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Global Back-Projection on an FPGA","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15240123","htmlLink":"/document/7130996/","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Global Back-Projection on an FPGA","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060044S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7130996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7130999,"authors":[{"name":"Yigong Xiao","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.

We propose the novel algorithm, which is consisted of an recursive signal energy accumulated process and a novel Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). Unlike the classic method which detects the signal and estimate it's location and length in each measurement independently, the proposed algorithm makes it equivalent to a random walking process, then estimates the moving velocity during the recursive process and obtains the Maximum Likelihood Estimations (MLEs) of the unknown signal length through a Dynamic Programming (DP) method. Meanwhile, the decision result and the estimations output at the same time. The performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated by numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7130999","startPage":"0220","endPage":"0225","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07130999.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7130999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and estimation a scattering signal with unknown location and length in multiple measurement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Scattering","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Length measurement","Earthquakes","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO radar","radar detection","radar resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scattering signal detection","unknown location","signal processing","high resolution multiple-input multiple-output radars","HR MIMO radars","novel generalized likelihood ratio test","GLRT","maximum likelihood estimations","dynamic programming method","MLE","DP method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scattering Signal","Recursive Accumulated Process","Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test","Dynamic Programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7130999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detection and estimation a scattering signal with unknown location and length in multiple measurement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7130999/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15239959","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and estimation a scattering signal with unknown location and length in multiple measurement","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061216S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7130999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7131001,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To this end, we model the uncertainty set associated with each steering vector through two double-sided, potentially non-convex, quadratic constraints. Additionally, we force two suitable constraints on the optimization variable. The former accounts for the width of the mainbeam, whereas the latter is either a uniform or a relaxed elemental power requirement allowing to control the amount of transmitted power. We prove that the mentioned design leads to a non-convex optimization problem which remarkably shares some hidden convexity. Hence, we devise a polynomial time procedure aimed at synthesizing an optimal MIMO waveform covariance. Finally, at the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the proposed design technique showing that it ensures an improved worst case performance than some counterparts available in open literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131001.pdf","startPage":"0231","endPage":"0236","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSL-based beampattern design for MIMO radar systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","MIMO radar","Robustness","Optimization","Uncertainty","Radar antennas","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","covariance matrices","MIMO radar","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design technique","MIMO waveform covariance","polynomial time procedure","nonconvex optimization problem","quadratic constraints","Peak Sidelobe Level","MIMO waveform covariance matrix","multiple-input multiple-output","MIMO radar systems","PSL-based beampattern design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Radar","Transmit Beampattern","Waveform Covariance Matrix","Steering Vector Mismatches","Robust Design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"PSL-based beampattern design for MIMO radar systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131001/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15239995","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSL-based beampattern design for MIMO radar systems","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073788S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131002,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Anitori","affiliation":["TNO The Hague, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Anitori","id":"37300862700"},{"name":"Wim van Rossum","affiliation":["TNO The Hague, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"van Rossum","id":"37266739800"},{"name":"Albert Huizing","affiliation":["TNO The Hague, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Huizing","id":"37401846000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131002","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":382},"abstract":"In this paper we present some preliminary results on antenna array extrapolation for Direction Of Arrival (DOA) estimation using Sparse Reconstruction (SR).

It is shown that similarly efficient equations are available for those gradient calculations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient energy gradient calculations for binary and polyphase sequences","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131014","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131014.pdf","startPage":"0304","endPage":"0309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient energy gradient calculations for binary and polyphase sequences","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131014/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240095","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient energy gradient calculations for binary and polyphase sequences","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058791S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131017,"authors":[{"name":"Ruijin Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ruijin Jin","id":"37087805889"},{"name":"Junjun Yin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Junjun Yin","id":"37087154405"},{"name":"Wei Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Zhou","id":"37087170124"},{"name":"Jian Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280193200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131017","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Synthetic aperture radar","Detectors","Wavelet transforms","Roads","Filter banks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","edge detection","feature extraction","image denoising","image enhancement","image filtering","image fusion","radar imaging","radar polarimetry","synthetic aperture radar","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge feature detection","polarimetric SAR images","polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images","nonsubsampled contourlet transform","speckle noise","NSCT","adaptive optimal polarimetric contrast enhancement model","OPCE model","point-wise modulus maximum","multidirection subbands","pol-SAR data","Convair-580","nonsubsampled contrast pyramid","multiscale image filtering","multiscale edge image fusion","nonsubsampled directional filter banks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR)","nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT)","edge detection","optimal polarimetric contrast enhancement (OPCE)","multiscale"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131017","abstract":"Due to the presence of speckle noise, the detection of edge features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is complicated. In this paper, a new method is proposed for edge detection of polarimetric SAR (Pol-SAR) images, based on the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). Firstly, we develop the nonsubsampled contrast pyramid (CP) for polarimetric images by introducing an adaptive optimal polarimetric contrast enhancement (OPCE) model, then the obtained multiscale images are filtered by the nonsubsampled directional filter banks. The point-wise modulus maximum is evaluated across of multidirection subbands in each scale. Finally, the multiscale edge images are fused to reduce the influence of noise. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with Pol-SAR data acquired by Convair-580, showing great potential of this method.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131017","startPage":"0319","endPage":"0323","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131017.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge detection in polarimetric SAR images based on the nonsubsampled contourlet transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Edge detection in polarimetric SAR images based on the nonsubsampled contourlet transform","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131017/","accessionNumber":"15239965","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131017/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge detection in polarimetric SAR images based on the nonsubsampled contourlet transform","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051464S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131043,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085462217"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406476300"},{"name":"Chunxiao Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunxiao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37398501200"},{"name":"Xudong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291966300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131043","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Games","Bayes methods","MIMO radar","Receivers","Game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","jamming","MIMO radar","radar cross-sections","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical MIMO radar","jammer","multiple input multiple output radar","intelligent target","power allocation optimization","adversarial interaction","two-person zero-sum game","Bayesian game","radar cross-section","radar receiver condition","utility functions","mutual information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","game theory","two-person zero-sum game","Bayesian game","power allocation","Nash equilibrium","mutual information"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the interaction between a statistical multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar and an intelligent target equipped with a jammer from the perspective of game theory.

passive radar and has been well developed. A novel interference cancellation model based on compressive sensing (CS) is proposed in this paper. The sparse matrix is constructed by exploiting the sparsity of the interference signal in delay-Doppler domain, with each column of which is the cross ambiguity function (CAF) of a delayed and Doppler shifted replica of the reference signal. However, the generation of the sparse matrix will be computationally extensive by routine processing, so a fast method is developed based on the fact that all the CAFs can be obtained from the self-ambiguity function (SAF) of the reference signal by approximating. The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is then applied to obtain the estimator of the sparse vector, which includes the information of the complex amplitude, delay and Doppler of the interference signal. With these parameters, the interference signal is reconstructed and removed from the surveillance signal. Besides dealing with both the stationary and moving clutter, the proposed cancellation algorithm can eliminate the strong target if required by modifying parameters accordingly. Simulation results show that the residual power of interference after cancellation is extremely low, which is meaningful for weak target detection.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131055","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131055.pdf","startPage":"0527","endPage":"0532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference cancellation based on compressive sensing for passive coherent radar (PACOR)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131055/","displayDocTitle":"Interference cancellation based on compressive sensing for passive coherent radar (PACOR)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240083","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131055/","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference cancellation based on compressive sensing for passive coherent radar (PACOR)","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071812S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131062,"authors":[{"name":"Troy Kilpatrick","affiliation":["School of Information Tech. & Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Queensland, Australia","Teledyne Defence Australia, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Troy","lastName":"Kilpatrick","id":"37085491409"},{"name":"I.

This is especially problematic for long range radars with many transmitter elements which require long code repetition intervals. This causes beamforming problems if the scene is not phase stationary over this interval. Shorter codes do not help, as they introduce cross correlation which also degrades the beamforming process. We give examples of two useful orthogonal coding schemes to show how range and transmitter numbers extend the code duration and how target Doppler affects the beamforming. We describe a processing technique which will compensate for Doppler, but only if it is constant over a suitable sequence of code repetition intervals. A novel technique is then presented which virtually eliminates these problems. This uses a perimeter array with phase scanned transmitter sub arrays and a two part orthogonal MIMO code. We also identify the unique ability MIMO has to focus at all distances simultaneously in the near field.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar - some practical considerations","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131062","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131062.pdf","startPage":"0566","endPage":"0571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar - some practical considerations","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131062/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240065","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar - some practical considerations","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0468S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131068,"authors":[{"name":"Anastasios Deligiannis","affiliation":["Electrical and Systems Engineering, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Deligiannis","id":"37085384861"},{"name":"Sangarapillai Lambotharan","affiliation":["Electrical and Systems Engineering, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Sangarapillai","lastName":"Lambotharan","id":"37273617900"},{"name":"Jonathon A.

The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the fully-overlapped subaperturing in both cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming for fully-overlapped two-dimensional Phased-MIMO radar","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131068","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131068.pdf","startPage":"0599","endPage":"0604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming for fully-overlapped two-dimensional Phased-MIMO radar","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131068/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240068","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming for fully-overlapped two-dimensional Phased-MIMO radar","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0723S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131069,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Impulse radar is one common GPR design scheme for its simple circuit architecture. However its weaknesses include low dynamic range and high cost complicate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) requirement. Stepped frequency continuous wave (SFCW) radar overcomes these obstacles by transmitting/receiving individual frequency tones sequentially, however with a low operating speed. This paper proposes a compressive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based GPR architecture to leverage operating efficiency. OFDM technique enables multi-tone frequency transmission/receiving, and CS technique allows sensing with reduced set of frequency tones without compromising sensing accuracy. The proposed compressive OFDM GPR design is evaluated using field data collected with a commercial GPR system.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131083","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131083.pdf","startPage":"0684","endPage":"0689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveform based ground penetrating radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131083/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveform based ground penetrating radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240203","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131083/","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveform based ground penetrating radar","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053227S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131084,"authors":[{"name":"Huichen Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huichen","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085501744"},{"name":"Jia Xu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085472844"},{"name":"Xudong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291966300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131084","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","Compressed sensing","Synthetic aperture radar","Image resolution","Ground penetrating radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","iterative methods","optimisation","radar imaging","radar resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing radar imaging technique","off-grid sparse targets","imaging resolution","CS radar imaging performance","atom optimization","iterative optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","radar imaging","off-grid","Alltop sequence"]}],"abstract":"Compressed sensing (CS) technique has been applied to radar imaging to maintain the imaging resolution with reduced amount of data. A necessary step for computation in existing CS radar imaging regimes is to divide the scene of interest into discrete grids, and the scattered signal from each grid is approximated as being reflected from an ideal point scatterer at the center of that grid. However, this approximation significantly affects CS radar imaging performance due to scatterers not in the centers, or off-grid. Existing algorithms utilize atom optimization or iterative optimization to image those off-grid scatterers. However, these algorithms require a minimal distance between scatterers. In this work, by redesigning the imaging scheme, modifying transmitted waveform and processing procedure, with the same amount of data, suitable bases can be selected and the imaging resolution is refined. The off-grid targets are then imaged on finer grids. Experiments show the performance and robustness of the scheme under different SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131084","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131084.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","startPage":"0690","endPage":"0693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing radar imaging of off-grid sparse targets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing radar imaging of off-grid sparse targets","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131084/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240092","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7131084/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing radar imaging of off-grid sparse targets","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062719S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131086,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael F.

The classifier must handle waveform alignment, different pulse widths, and should degrade gracefully with decreasing signal to noise ratios. Along with these tasks, a crowded spectrum makes it highly unlikely that every waveform encountered will be in the waveform library. In this paper, these challenges are addressed through a combination of feature design, training protocol, and classifier approach. The classifier used in this effort is the quantile one-class SVM (q-OCSVM) that has the desirable properties of out-of-class rejection and likelihood estimation. These design choices result in a high performance waveform classifier that addresses the aforementioned challenges as demonstrated with extensive experimentation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Support vector machines","Radar","Training data","Phase modulation","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","radar computing","radar signal processing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase modulated radar waveform classification","quantile one-class SVM","waveform alignment","signal to noise ratios","waveform library","feature design","training protocol","classifier approach","q-OCSVM","out-of-class rejection","likelihood estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131095","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131095.pdf","startPage":"0745","endPage":"0750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase modulated radar waveform classification using quantile one-class SVMs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase modulated radar waveform classification using quantile one-class SVMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131095/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131095/","accessionNumber":"15240121","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase modulated radar waveform classification using quantile one-class SVMs","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052037S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131096,"authors":[{"name":"Anastasia Panoui","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Anastasia","lastName":"Panoui","id":"37085561371"},{"name":"Sangarapillai Lambotharan","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Sangarapillai","lastName":"Lambotharan","id":"37273617900"},{"name":"Jonathon A.

The JDO SSPARC framework entails advanced radar-comms channel estimation, along with a real-time adaptive space-time transmit and receive optimization procedure to maximize forward channel signal-to-noise while simultaneously minimizing co-channel interference. Additionally, a new expression for radar capacity is introduced that when combined with traditional communication capacity provides a unified measure of the total capacity of the combined radar-comms network.

Traditionally, the compensations were usually implemented separately via different finite impulse response (FIR) filters based on different design criterions. In this paper, equalization and FD are realized jointly in one FIR filter based on the Farrow structure that provides a general polynomial approximation. The presented filter provides satisfactory compensation performance for both the channel mismatch and the aperture effect with low complexity.

We are concerned with the problem of detecting small targets in noise during night-time operation when reduced ionospheric propagation support limits the radar operating frequency to the lower part of the HF band and the external noise environment is higher than during daytime. Our receiving array design uses both over-dense array element spacing and sparse element spacing in a two-dimensional regular element configuration. The physical layout is both practically realistic and robust to ionospheric decorrelation effects for receiving arrays with very large spatial extent. We show that this design achieves performance close to the existing one-dimensional designs, but, unlike the current receiving arrays, scales in performance to the sensitivity levels required in future OTHR systems.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131112","startPage":"0840","endPage":"0845","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131112.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A regular two-dimensional over-sampled sparse receiving array for Over-The-Horizon Radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A regular two-dimensional over-sampled sparse receiving array for Over-The-Horizon Radar","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131112/","accessionNumber":"15239944","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131112/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A regular two-dimensional over-sampled sparse receiving array for Over-The-Horizon Radar","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055263S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131117,"authors":[{"name":"Na Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Li","id":"37085414450"},{"name":"Guolong Cui","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Guolong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37530814100"},{"name":"Haining Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Haining","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085412739"},{"name":"Lingjiang Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lingjiang","lastName":"Kong","id":"37529595100"},{"name":"Qing Huo Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, USA"],"firstName":"Qing Huo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277487800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131117","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Adaptation models","Detectors","Estimation","Receivers","MIMO radar","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","covariance matrices","MIMO radar","optimisation","radar antennas","radar clutter","radar detection","radar signal processing","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive detection","multiple a-priori spectral models","MIMO radar","multiple-input multiple-output radar","compound-Gaussian clutter","secondary data set","actual clutter inverse covariance structure","sequential optimization algorithm","unknown parameter estimation","approximate generalized likelihood ratio test","GLRT","signal processing","multiple receiving antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar","adaptive detection","multiple a-priori spectral models","inverse covariance matrix estimation","compound-Gaussian clutter"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the adaptive detection with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar in the presence of compound-Gaussian clutter with a limited number of secondary data set.

The property that different sensors share identical auto-term time-frequency regions renders the TFSR a group sparse reconstruction problem, which is effectively solved using the compressive sensing techniques for high-fidelity TFSR reconstruction. We exploit the adaptive optimal kernel (AOK) to effectively preserve signal auto-terms and mitigate cross-terms. High level of noise and artifacts due to missing samples, however, may render AOK ineffective if designed for each sensor separately. We develop a robust multi-sensor AOK design based on data fusion across all sensors so as to enhance the signal auto-terms while effectively mitigating artifacts, cross-terms, and noise. The superior performance of the proposed multi-sensor AOK design is demonstrated through the comparison with its single-antenna counterpart and data-independent kernels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Kernel","Arrays","Fourier transforms","Compressed sensing","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","sensor fusion","signal representation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisensor kernel design","time-frequency analysis","sparsely sampled nonstationary signals","sparsity-based time-frequency signal representation","randomly thinned nonstationary signals","autoterm time-frequency regions","compressive sensing techniques","high-fidelity TFSR reconstruction","adaptive optimal kernel","AOK design","data fusion","cross-terms","single-antenna counterpart","data-independent kernels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","array processing","compressive sensing","missing data sample","sparse reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131122","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131122.pdf","startPage":"0896","endPage":"0900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-sensor kernel design for time-frequency analysis of sparsely sampled nonstationary signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-sensor kernel design for time-frequency analysis of sparsely sampled nonstationary signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131122/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131122/","accessionNumber":"15240206","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-sensor kernel design for time-frequency analysis of sparsely sampled nonstationary signals","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056594S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131123,"authors":[{"name":"Vichet Duk","affiliation":["University of Adelaide"],"firstName":"Vichet","lastName":"Duk","id":"37085569686"},{"name":"Brian Ng","affiliation":["University of Adelaide"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Ng","id":"37085544365"},{"name":"Luke Rosenberg","affiliation":["Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Australia","University of Adelaide"],"firstName":"Luke","lastName":"Rosenberg","id":"37409197600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131123","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Interference","Radar","Shape","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","radar clutter","radar detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D wavelet transforms","small target detection","radar operators","stationary wavelet transform","SWT","medium grazing angle X-band sea-clutter","nonstationary sea-clutter","amplitude statistics","cell-averaging constant false alarm rate detection scheme","time domain","endo-clutter region"]}],"abstract":"Small target detection in sea clutter remains a challenging problem for radar operators. This paper investigates the potential of using a stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to improve target detection in medium grazing angle X-band sea-clutter. One level of the 2D SWT produces four sub-bands which highlight or suppress different features of the non-stationary sea-clutter. Once they have been individually reconstructed back to the original domain, both the amplitude statistics of the sub-bands and their relative detection performance are investigated.

It has since been shown [2] that a conventional array radar can do as well as a MIMO full/thin array radar. Specifically, a conventional full/thin array radar was shown to provide the SAME resolution and accuracy as the MIMO array. The conventional full/thin array had some disadvantages relative to grating lobes that had to be dealt with but in some situations it could provide better energy search efficiency than its MIMO equivalent. Here a new conventional array is presented which has the SAME accuracy and resolution as the MIMO full/thin array radar and has NO GRATING LOBES. Also it uses the same search time and power-aperture product to do volume search as the MIMO radar. The new conventional array consists of the same full and thin arrays but with their roles reversed with the thin array transmitting and the full array receiving. The new conventional array is called a thin/full array to distinguish it from the former full/thin array. The properties of the full/thin and thin/full MIMO and conventional array radars are detailed on here relative to waveforms and matched filter signal processing loads. The matched filter processing load for MIMO full/thin and thin/full arrays are dependent on whether the transmit or receive beam forming is done first. Finally it is pointed out that MIMO radar systems do not have any advantages relative to barrage jammer, hot clutter jammer or repeater jammer suppression.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131126","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131126.pdf","startPage":"0918","endPage":"0924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radars and their conventional equivalents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131126/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radars and their conventional equivalents","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240174","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131126/","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radars and their conventional equivalents","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0493S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131133,"authors":[{"name":"Bailu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"lastName":"Bailu Wang","id":"37073577900"},{"name":"Wei Yi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"lastName":"Wei Yi","id":"37671280000"},{"name":"Suqi Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"lastName":"Suqi Li","id":"37073587300"},{"name":"Lingjiang Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"lastName":"Lingjiang Kong","id":"37529595100"},{"name":"Xiaobo Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"lastName":"Xiaobo Yang","id":"37275560600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131133","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Target tracking","Closed-form solutions","Correlation","Approximation algorithms","Monte Carlo methods","Kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","covariance analysis","filtering theory","Monte Carlo methods","statistical distributions","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed fusion","generalized covariance intersection","multiBernoulli filter","distributed multitarget tracking","G-CI","multiBernoulli posterior distribution","closed-form expression","fused posterior approximation","\u03b4-generalized labelled multiBernoulli formed distribution","\u03b4-GLMB formed distribution","feedback working mode","firstorder statistical moment","sequential Monte Carlo technique"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we consider the distributed multi-target tracking through the use of multi-Bernoulli based on generalized Covariance Intersection (G-CI).

In this paper, we compare the performance and computational complexity of the MBMP applied to the STAP problem and the STAP beamformer. In addition we propose two methods to reduce the computational complexity of MBMP, a modification to the MBMP algorithm which we refer to as truncated MBMP, and a grid refinement technique.

This approach can produce physical radar emissions with ultra-low sidelobes that support sufficient spectral roll-off to maintain forthcoming spectral compliance requirements. A small SNR loss is traded for a substantial reduction in range sidelobes. Further, it is demonstrated that this tapered waveform scheme can be readily combined with the linear amplification using nonlinear components (LINC) architecture to realize the small yet necessary amplitude variation while operating the power amplifiers in saturation, which may be used to realize enhanced power efficiency. Experimental measurements demonstrate range sidelobes below -80 dB with less than 0.3 dB in SNR loss.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-low sidelobe waveform design via spectral shaping and LINC transmit architecture","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131144","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131144.pdf","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-low sidelobe waveform design via spectral shaping and LINC transmit architecture","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131144/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240085","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-low sidelobe waveform design via spectral shaping and LINC transmit architecture","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108646S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131151,"authors":[{"name":"Faruk Uysal","affiliation":["Advanced Radar Research Center, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK"],"firstName":"Faruk","lastName":"Uysal","id":"38246478600"},{"name":"Mark Yeary","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Yeary","id":"37085503768"},{"name":"Nathan Goodman","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Goodman","id":"37273039700"},{"name":"Rafael F.

Hence, this paper describes the initial designs of a wideband transmit beamformer for a multi-channel high resolution radar, applicable to airborne and spaceborne radars. As a case study for this paper, we use the EcoSAR instrument developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for the measurement of science parameters. The wideband EcoSAR employs two multi-channel antennas and full transmit and receive digital beamforming to generate high resolution images of the ground features. Maintaining a consistent beampattern when the bandwidth is approximately 50% of the center frequency is a challenge. Breaking this nexus relies on optimum beam weight design and accompanying waveform design; not merely the former as is typically done. The approaches of this paper have shown how the beampatterns can be maintained while meeting beam requirements.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131151","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131151.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131151","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform design for wideband beampattern and beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Waveform design for wideband beampattern and beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131151/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131151/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240250","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform design for wideband beampattern and beamforming","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056942S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7131162,"authors":[{"name":"Christos V.

First, a `principal' weight vector is designed for transmit beamforming to achieve a desired transmit power distribution, e.g., to focus the transmit power within certain desired spatial sector(s), while minimizing the out-of-sector power. Then, the designed weight vector is used to generate a population of `companion' weight vectors of the same size and having the same transmit power distribution as that of the principal weight vector. Multiple transmit beams are formed using the companion weight vectors where an orthogonal waveform is transmitted over each beam. Matched-filtering the received single-snapshot data to the orthogonal transmitted waveforms yields a number of virtual data snapshots equal to the number of orthogonal waveforms. By properly choosing the number of waveforms, the virtual data snapshots are guaranteed to yield a full-rank sample covariance matrix, which enables application of high-resolution DOA estimation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides DOA estimation performance superior to that of traditional MIMO radar based MUSIC, the conventional (Bartlett) beamformer, and the spheroidal sequences based beamformer.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131164","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131164.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution single-snapshot DOA estimation in MIMO radar with colocated antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution single-snapshot DOA estimation in MIMO radar with colocated antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131164/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240213","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7131164/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution single-snapshot DOA estimation in MIMO radar with colocated antennas","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07287S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7131166,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Mingyang Wang","id":"37085369961"},{"name":"Guolong Cui","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Guolong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37530814100"},{"name":"Wei Yi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Wei Yi","id":"37671280000"},{"name":"Lingjiang Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lingjiang","lastName":"Kong","id":"37529595100"},{"name":"Xiaobo Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37275560600"},{"name":"Liang Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Liang Yuan","id":"37076379700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131166","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Radar imaging","MIMO","Delays","Transmitting antennas","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","permittivity","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-division MIMO TWR imaging","multiple walls","dielectric constants","time-division multiple-input multiple-output through-the-wall radar imaging","back-projection-based algorithm","signal model","focus delay","Fermat theory","Snell's law","high quality image"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the imaging problem of a target hiding behind multiple walls with known thicknesses and dielectric constants using time-division multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) through-the-wall radar (TWR).

It has been demonstrated that the tracking performance can be further improved by utilizing more information. With regard to polarimetric radar system where polarization information (PI) is available, PI thus should also be exploited to ensure robustness of tracking performance. This paper considers the target tracking of polarimetric radar by incorporating PI into the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF). Firstly, a generalized structure of PI aided PDAF (PDAFPI) method is given. It is suitable for different radar models and different data association algorithms. Secondly, for the polarimetric monostatic radar, two versions of PDAFPI method are proposed for a single-target tracking. Specifically, the first version is the PDAFPI algorithm in optimum case (O-PDAFPI) where the polarimetric characteristics of target and noise covariances are known as a prior. The later one is a fully adaptive PDAFPI algorithm suitable for the suboptimum cases (S-PDAFPI) where the polarimetric parameters are unknown. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively improve the tracking performance and track more reliably both non-maneuvering and maneuvering targets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Radar tracking","Radar polarimetry","Noise","Covariance matrices","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","probability","radar polarimetry","radar tracking","sensor fusion","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization information aided probabilistic data association","single-target tracking","polarimetric monostatic radar system","radar tracking","kinematic measurements","polarization information","probabilistic data association filter","radar models","O-PDAFPI","target covariances","noise covariances","fully adaptive PDAFPI algorithm","suboptimum cases","S-PDAFPI"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131173","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131173.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A polarization information aided probabilistic data association for target tracking in polarimetric radar system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A polarization information aided probabilistic data association for target tracking in polarimetric radar system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131173/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131173/","accessionNumber":"15240148","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A polarization information aided probabilistic data association for target tracking in polarimetric radar system","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060449S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131174,"authors":[{"name":"Troy Kilpatrick","affiliation":["School of Information Tech. & Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Queensland, Australia","Teledyne Defence Australia, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Troy","lastName":"Kilpatrick","id":"37085491409"},{"name":"I.

However, high resolution imaging demands acquisition of large amounts of data, which has motivated researchers towards the application of Compressed Sensing techniques in radar imaging, if the target space is sparse. It might be noted that apart from sparsity, most UWB radar signatures also exhibit another property of being clustered into groups that conventional sparse reconstruction techniques like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) or Lasso rarely take into account. Though attempts have been made to reconstruct block sparse signals using BlockOMP or Group Lasso, these algorithms inherently assume specific locations and sizes of the possible clusters, and hence are not satisfactory if the clusters are randomly located and variably sized. In this manuscript, the traditional block based approach has been extended for Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) model. To address its shortcomings, a novel framework that is referred to as a locally adapting matching pursuit (LAMP) has been proposed for the efficient reconstruction of radar signatures from compressed measurements considering both sparsity and clustering priors, but without assuming any specific group structure like BOMP or Group Lasso. The performance of the proposed LAMP has been compared with existing algorithms in different scenarios. The framework has also been successfully applied on a real-world radar imaging data, with different types of sensing matrices.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131180","startPage":"1216","endPage":"1221","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131180.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Ultra Wide Band Radar imaging in a locally adapting matching pursuit (LAMP) framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Ultra Wide Band Radar imaging in a locally adapting matching pursuit (LAMP) framework","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131180/","accessionNumber":"15240100","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131180/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Ultra Wide Band Radar imaging in a locally adapting matching pursuit (LAMP) framework","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054953S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131188,"authors":[{"name":"Aboulnasr Hassanien","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Aboulnasr","lastName":"Hassanien","id":"37409806200"},{"name":"Moeness G.

A set of Q orthogonal waveforms is exploited to embed a sequence of Q bits during each radar pulse. All waveforms are transmitted simultaneously where one bit is embedded in each waveform. We design two transmit weight vectors to achieve two distinct transmit power distribution patterns which share the same main radar beam but have different sidelobe levels towards the communication direction. The receiver interprets the bit associated with a certain waveform as binary information based on whether that waveform is radiated over the transmit beam associated with the first or the second weight vector. The proposed technique enables information delivering to a single or multiple communication directions located outside the mainlobe of the radar. The communication message has low probability of intercept from directions other than the preassigned communication directions. Additionally, the waveform diversity enables the radar to operate in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mode.

By leveraging multiple collocated transmitters and receivers, the waveform diversity offered by MIMO FLGPR systems provides performance enhancement in target detection, parameter identifiability, and increased cross-range resolution. In this paper, we introduce a data-dependent image formation algorithm based on the sparse learning via iterative minimization (SLIM) approach for high-resolution imaging applied to both time- and frequency-domain. In addition, we compare time-domain SLIM (TD-SLIM) and frequency-domain SLIM (FD-SLIM) with data-independent methods such as delay-and-sum (DAS) and recursive sidelobe minimization (RSM), designed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). These algorithms are applied to data collected by the Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar developed by ARL for landmine detection. When applied to data collected by this 2 by 16 MIMO radar system, both the TD-SLIM and FD-SLIM algorithms yield results with higher resolution than the two conventional methods applied to the data. FD-SLIM provides significantly reduced computational time compared to TD-SLIM, motivating its application for high-resolution MIMO FLGPR imaging.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time- and frequency-domain MIMO FLGPR imaging","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131197","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131197.pdf","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Time- and frequency-domain MIMO FLGPR imaging","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131197/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15239985","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time- and frequency-domain MIMO FLGPR imaging","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058327S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131199,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00f6khan M.

In practical systems, nonidealities often impose the dominant limitation to system performance. Consequently, successful high-performance systems typically employ adaptive techniques. Because of the higher potential performance of MIMO systems, they become even more sensitive to the system model if adaptivity is not employed. The quintessential example of the need for adaptivity is by ground-moving-target indictor (GMTI) radars, which employ space-time adaptive processing (STAP). As an initial step toward a more general study of test statistic robustness, we study an approximation to STAP, based on requiring test statistic invariance to clutter localization about an angle-Doppler operating point.

However, the dimensions of the clutter covariance matrix (CCM) are increased and more independent and identically distributed (iid) training samples are required to estimate the CCM. In this paper, a sparse recovery based dimensional reduced method is proposed to cancel the clutter without training samples. Unlike exist direct data domain sparse recovery (D3SR) method, the proposed method only uses partial grids in space-time domain to reconstruct the CCM and the computation load is then reduced.

One key element of such systems is a smart user interface that tracks and recognizes drivers' hand gestures. Hand gesture sensing using traditional computer vision techniques is challenging because of wide variations in lighting conditions, e.g. inside a car. A short-range radar device can provide additional information, including the location and instantaneous radial velocity of moving objects. We describe a novel end-to-end (hardware, interface, and software) short-range FMCW radar-based system designed to effectively sense dynamic hand gestures. We provide an effective method for selecting the parameters of the FMCW waveform and for jointly calibrating the radar system with a depth sensor. Finally, we demonstrate that our system guarantees reliable and robust performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-range FMCW monopulse radar for hand-gesture sensing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131232","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131232.pdf","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Short-range FMCW monopulse radar for hand-gesture sensing","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131232/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240027","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-range FMCW monopulse radar for hand-gesture sensing","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057382S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7131233,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Ai","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, CN"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Ai"},{"name":"Wei Yi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yi","id":"37671280000"},{"name":"Rick S.

The second one is a suboptimal called successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) algorithm proposed in our previous work [1] which localizes targets one-by-one and clears the interference of previous declared targets. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for these two algorithms has been derived and compared with emphasis on special cases where some targets share no common range bins with any other targets.

If a bistatic pair in a Multistatic MIMO radar system employs multiple transmit and receive elements, this increases the dimensionality of the data received over a Coherent Processing Interval (CPI), which in turn increases the training data needed to reliably estimate the covariance matrix. This, coupled with the non-stationarity in the received data resulting from the bistatic geometry further degrades the quality of the covariance matrix estimate used in the adaptive detector. In [1], Bell et al. presented a physics based MIMO clutter model, and showed that lack of training data support renders the MIMO radar unfeasible in that the individual bistatic pairs can outperform the overall MIMO system. In addition to that, a radar collects target free training samples from the range cells adjacent to the cell under test, and because of the range-dependent variation in the clutter angle-Doppler behavior, the data used from these target-free range bins causes an estimation error, and degrades the STAP performance. To counter the effects of limited training data, we need to investigate techniques that perform reasonably well in data limited scenarios, and to ensure that the training data does not cause a significant performance degradation due to angle-Doppler variation in the clutter associated with range, we need to study techniques to compensate for this range-dependent angle-Doppler variation. We show that the physics-based clutter model presented in [1] can be approximated as an AR process of model order 4, and that angle-Doppler compensation can be used to align the spectral centers in the training data obtained from target-free range bins. This has implications for reducing the error associated with estimating the multichannel AR parameters from available training data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angle-Doppler compensation for Multistatic MIMO radar","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131247","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131247.pdf","startPage":"1569","endPage":"1574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Angle-Doppler compensation for Multistatic MIMO radar","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131247/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240113","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angle-Doppler compensation for Multistatic MIMO radar","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08492S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131251,"authors":[{"name":"Siddharth Baskar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio"],"firstName":"Siddharth","lastName":"Baskar","id":"37085380306"},{"name":"Emre Ertin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Ertin","id":"37284980800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131251","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":543},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Receivers","Radar antennas","MIMO radar","Mixers","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive radar","antenna arrays","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave propagation","field programmable gate arrays","MIMO radar","multiplexing","radar antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radar platform","waveform adaptive MIMO radar research","adaptive independent waveform selection","spatial diversity gains","temporal diversity gains","transmit antennas","detection capability","classification capability","tracking capability","propagation environments","OSU micro SDR platform","custom integrated X-Band RF frontend","single receive channel multiplexing","digital back-end","FPGA","embedded PC","real-time receive processing","waveform scheduling"]}],"abstract":"MIMO Radar systems that can adaptively select independent waveforms on transmit antennas can provide spatial and temporal diversity gains for improved detection, classification and tracking capability in challenging propagation environments.

Due to the real-time nature of SAR imaging-related tasks, it is desired to have faster hardware implementations of reconstruction algorithms. In this paper we study FPGA-based implementation of the RMA algorithm using a novel pipelined Non-uniform FFT (NuFFT) module that optimizes its operation by exploiting the order in which samples are presented.

Each RA receives a measurement of the signal sent by a transmit antenna (TA) and reflected from target, possibly in the presence of clutter and interference, amplifies it, and forwards it to the FC on a wireless fading channel. The FC receives the signals transmitted by the RAs and determines the presence of a target. The problem of maximizing the Bhattacharyya distance as the detection performance metric under power constraints for the TA and RAs is formulated with respect to the transmitted code vector and the gains applied at the RAs. A short-term adaptive design is first considered that leverages the instant gain of the RAs-to-FC channels, and then a long-term adaptive design is considered that uses only stochastic channel state information (CSI). Algorithmic solutions for both scenarios are proposed based on successive convex approximation, and the performance is evaluated via numerical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of multistatic cloud radar with multiple-access wireless backhaul","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131263","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131263.pdf","startPage":"1650","endPage":"1655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of multistatic cloud radar with multiple-access wireless backhaul","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131263/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240057","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of multistatic cloud radar with multiple-access wireless backhaul","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090937S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131266,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The new mode exploits this flexibility to both rapidly characterize strong clutter discretes and minimize their impact on target detection performance, while minimizing impact to radar timeline. The new mode leverages a MIMO probing approach that rapidly characterizes the clutter discretes in the scene and uses the received signals to form an appropriate space-time waveform response that minimizes their radar return and impact on radar performance during the processing of subsequent radar pulses.

Researchers have suggested that in order to solve the spectrum crisis, future spectrum users will be required to be frequency-flexible and cognitive, and spectrum sharing protocols on communication system have thus been studied. Radars, in the present form, are spectrum users which have fixed operating frequencies, high power and tendency to interfere with other users. Because of these characteristics, conventional radar will have difficulty in cooperating with spectrum sharing communication systems. Though the idea of combining radar and communication has been around for a long time, few have considered operating a radar in the communication band until recently. In order to make radar and communication systems coexist in the same band, one must maintain the quality of communication links. Additionally, radar should also be cognitive to benefit from the knowledge provided by the communication systems. In this paper, we investigate how future radars respond to spectrum sharing environment and derive optimal waveforms satisfying the spectral requirement.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131272","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131272.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","startPage":"1698","endPage":"1703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar waveform design in spectrum sharing environment: Coexistence and cognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radar waveform design in spectrum sharing environment: Coexistence and cognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131272/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240214","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7131272/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar waveform design in spectrum sharing environment: Coexistence and cognition","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045642S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131274,"authors":[{"name":"Georgia Bournaka","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Bournaka","id":"37990726500"},{"name":"Aurora Baruzzi","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Aurora","lastName":"Baruzzi","id":"37085460387"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Heckenbach","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Heckenbach","id":"37401648700"},{"name":"Heiner Kuschel","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Heiner","lastName":"Kuschel","id":"37328843300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8232-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8231-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"7131274","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Multiple signal classification","Passive radar","Array signal processing","Smoothing methods","Antennas","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","passive radar","radar signal processing","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming techniques","moving target localization","passive radar","Bucci based beamformer design","MUSIC algorithm","DVB-T broadcasting station","spatial smoothing based Bucci algorithm","angle of arrival estimation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental validation of beamforming techniques for localization of moving target in passive radar","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","endPage":"1713","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131274.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131274","startPage":"1710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131274","abstract":"We investigate the performance of a Bucci based beamformer design and MUSIC algorithm under a passive radar setup using experimental measurements.

This work proposes spatial smoothing based Bucci algorithm whose angle of arrival estimation performance is comparable to that of the MUSIC algorithm, however, this method does not need the computationally expensive singular value decomposition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15240226","htmlLink":"/document/7131274/","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Experimental validation of beamforming techniques for localization of moving target in passive radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental validation of beamforming techniques for localization of moving target in passive radar","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053593S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7131277,"authors":[{"name":"Dylan Eustice","affiliation":["Wireless and Microwave Circuits and Systems Program, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dylan","lastName":"Eustice","id":"37085391792"},{"name":"Charles Baylis","affiliation":["Wireless and Microwave Circuits and Systems Program, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Baylis","id":"37275575800"},{"name":"Lawrence Cohen","affiliation":["Radar Division, United States Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA"],"firstName":"Lawrence","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37327292800"},{"name":"Robert J.

Nonlinear power amplifiers in radar transmitters provide many undesirable effects, including spreading of the radar spectrum. Based on the known impacts of the power amplifier nonlinearities on the waveform and spectrum that is transmitted, this paper assesses the related impacts on the ambiguity function and, therefore, on the estimation precision capabilities of the radar. Simulation results for nonlinear microwave power-amplifier transistor models are presented to illustrate the theory that is presented. Simulations using a Gaussian Barker code implementation show that amplifier nonlinearities cause widening of ambiguity content in the Doppler dimension, widening of range sidelobes, and deepening of range and Doppler nulls. The theory and observations presented in this paper are expected to find significant application in radar waveform optimization to provide desired ambiguity-function properties while maintaining spectral compliance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Correlation","Doppler radar","Power amplifiers","Optimization","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","Gaussian processes","microwave power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar ambiguity function","range detection","Doppler detection","range-Doppler combinations","radar transmitters","radar spectrum","estimation precision capabilities","nonlinear microwave power-amplifier transistor models","Gaussian Barker code","Doppler dimension","range sidelobes","range nulls","Doppler nulls","spectral compliance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ambiguity function","power amplifiers","spectrum engineering","estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131277","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131277.pdf","startPage":"1725","endPage":"1729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of power amplifier nonlinearities on the radar ambiguity function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of power amplifier nonlinearities on the radar ambiguity function","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131277/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131277/","accessionNumber":"15240075","conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of power amplifier nonlinearities on the radar ambiguity function","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046687S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131282,"authors":[{"name":"Bruce L.

Clutter non-homogeneity is problematic in space-time adaptive processing (STAP) for airborne bistatic radar systems. The non-homogeneity is due to variation in angle-Doppler response at different bistatic ranges. In typical STAP applications this leads to poor clutter covariance matrix estimates and therefore reduced clutter cancellation. Previous approaches to compensating for this effect seek to modify the secondary data in order to align the clutter statistics for each bistatic range cell. Linear transformation approaches such as Doppler warping and angle-Doppler compensation determine the necessary shift in angle and Doppler between range cells at the spectral center of the clutter ridge but result in incomplete registration of the data. The registration-based compensation approach matches multiple points along the clutter ridge but is a nonlinear method that forms an estimate covariance matrix without an explicit linear transformation of the data. We propose instead a registration-based compensation method which aligns multiple registration points using focusing matrices to accomplish the linear transformation of the data.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131282","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120813/7130933/07131282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2015.7131282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7130933","startPage":"1750","endPage":"1755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range-dependence compensation for bistatic STAP using focusing matrices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Range-dependence compensation for bistatic STAP using focusing matrices","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131282/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240192","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7131282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range-dependence compensation for bistatic STAP using focusing matrices","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"3498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051861S","chronDate":"10-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120813","isNumber":"7130933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120813","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7130933","articleId":"7131282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131283,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan A.

Hence, TCs have found widespread employment in spectrum-constrained wireless communication applications, such as cellular telephony, wireless local area network, and broadcast systems. Recently, however, TCs have also been considered for energy-constrained wireless communication applications, such as wireless sensor networks and the `Internet of Things.' In these applications, TCs may also be employed for reducing the required transmission EC, instead of improving the BER. However, TCs have relatively high computational complexities, and hence, the associated signal-processing-related ECs are not insignificant. Therefore, when parameterizing TCs for employment in energy-constrained applications, both the processing EC and the transmission EC must be jointly considered. In this tutorial, we investigate holistic design methodologies conceived for this purpose. We commence by introducing turbo coding in detail, highlighting the various parameters of TCs and characterizing their impact on the encoded bit rate, on the radio frequency bandwidth requirement, on the transmission EC and on the BER. Following this, energy-efficient TC decoder application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) architecture designs are exemplified, and the processing EC is characterized as a function of the TC parameters. Finally, the TC parameters are selected in order to minimize the sum of the processing EC and the transmission EC.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2448692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/07131434.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2448692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"20 Years of Turbo Coding and Energy-Aware Design Guidelines for Energy-Constrained Wireless Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131434/","displayDocTitle":"20 Years of Turbo Coding and Energy-Aware Design Guidelines for Energy-Constrained Wireless Applications","volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","accessionNumber":"15730371","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131434/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC, Swindon, U.K.","grantNumber":"EP/J015520/1 and EP/L010550/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"20 Years of Turbo Coding and Energy-Aware Design Guidelines for Energy-Constrained Wireless Applications","sourcePdf":"comst-hanzo-2448692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143351S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"7131434","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131435,"authors":[{"name":"Leonid B.

The backscattering process is modelled by a set of discrete scatterers with properly chosen parameters. Explicit equations for calculating the amplitude and the phase of the backscattered signal are obtained. The developed model predicts spectral and autocorrelation characteristics of the amplitude signals that are validated by experimental results. Characteristics of the phase signals, practicable for studying the sensing applications of the OTDR system, are presented and studied as well, demonstrating good correspondence with experiment. A more detailed modelling of distributed vibration sensing systems and their response to disturbances along an optical fiber will be possible as an extension of the developed formalism.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2449085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182409","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7182409/07131435.pdf","endPage":"3671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamentals of Optical Fiber Sensing Schemes Based on Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometry: Signal Model Under Static Fiber Conditions","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2449085","startPage":"3660","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fundamentals of Optical Fiber Sensing Schemes Based on Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometry: Signal Model Under Static Fiber Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131435/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15360205","publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7131435/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"17","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamentals of Optical Fiber Sensing Schemes Based on Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometry: Signal Model Under Static Fiber Conditions","sourcePdf":"jlt-hartog-2449085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088531S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7182409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7182409","articleId":"7131435","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7131436,"authors":[{"name":"Quoc Duy Vo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7393921/7131436/vo-2448632-small.gif","p":["\n\nQuoc Duy Vo (S'15) received the B.E. degree in computer science and \nengineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, and the master's degree from Soongsil University, \nKorea in 2010.

Typically, outdoor localization techniques have relied on GPS or on cellular infrastructure support. While GPS gives high positioning accuracy, it can quickly deplete the battery on the device. On the other hand, base station based localization has low accuracy. In search of alternative techniques for outdoor localization, several approaches have explored the use of data gathered from other available sensors, like accelerometer, microphone, compass, and even daily patterns of usage, to identify unique signatures that can locate a device. Signatures, or fingerprints of an area, are hidden cues existing around a user's environment. However, under different operating scenarios, fingerprint-based localization techniques have variable performance in terms of accuracy, latency of detection, battery usage. The main contribution of this survey is to present a classification of existing fingerprint-based localization approaches which intelligently sense and match different clues from the environment for location identification. We describe how each fingerprinting technique works, followed by a review of the merits and demerits of the systems built based on these techniques. We conclude by identifying several improvements and application domain for fingerprinting based localization.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2448632","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/07131436.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2448632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","startPage":"491","endPage":"506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Fingerprint-Based Outdoor Localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Fingerprint-Based Outdoor Localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131436/","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7131436/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","accessionNumber":"15730358","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning), Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Fingerprint-Based Outdoor Localization","sourcePdf":"comst-vo-2448632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089627S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"7131436","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":7131452,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Makhoul","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7384408/7131452/makho-2438898-small.gif","p":["Eduardo Makhoul (S\u201909\u2013M\u201915) was born in Homs, Siria, in 1985.

The optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector of the DSM system employs the classic block-by-block method for jointly detecting the activated antenna matrix (AM) and the modulation symbols, resulting in high computational complexity. In this letter, a low-complexity near-ML detector, which operates on a symbol-by-symbol basis, is proposed for the DSM scheme. Specifically, in each block, the index of the activated transmit antenna and modulation symbol in each time slot are first obtained, and then, these antenna indices are utilized to simply determine the index of the activated AM. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of offering almost the same performance as that of the ML detector with more than 90% reduction in complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity Detection Scheme for Differential Spatial Modulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2448616","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7265139/07131457.pdf","startPage":"1516","endPage":"1519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2448616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7265139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity Detection Scheme for Differential Spatial Modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7131457/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456744","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471090"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329001"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2013J112"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0058"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2013D05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity Detection Scheme for Differential Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"lcomm-yang-2448616-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068333S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7265139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7265139","articleId":"7131457","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7131461,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the proposed technique, each sensor node exploits at least one orthogonal sub-carrier as its allocated signature, to respond the ND and ToA estimation requests transmitted by target nodes. The target node utilizes the orthogonality across sub-carriers to detect the transmitted signatures and their corresponding delays. This technique is energy efficient as it avoids multiple transmissions and receptions inherent in traditional ND protocols and ToA estimation techniques in WSN. Moreover, in this technique, network initiation process does not require channel information or time synchronization across sensor nodes. The performance of the proposed method is studied by evaluating the probabilities of false alarm and miss detection of the ND. In addition, ToA estimation error is calculated theoretically and via simulations. Moreover, the impact of available bandwidth on the performance and energy efficiency of ND and ToA estimation are investigated. Simulation results confirm the energy efficiency and the feasibility of the proposed method even at low signal-to-noise ratio regimes and in multi-path and frequency selective channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7181761/07131469.pdf","startPage":"5821","endPage":"5833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2449079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2449079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Neighbor Discovery and Time of Arrival Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks via OFDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Time of arrival estimation","Wireless sensor networks","Estimation","Wireless communication","Distance measurement","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","probability","signal detection","time-of-arrival estimation","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint neighbor discovery","coarse time-of-arrival estimation","wireless sensor networks","WSN","OFDMA","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","sensor nodes","orthogonal subcarrier","allocated signature","ND estimation requests","ToA estimation requests","target nodes","transmitted signature detection","false alarm probability","miss detection probability","energy efficiency","low signal-to-noise ratio regimes","multipath channels","frequency selective channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor network","neighbor discovery","time-of-arrival","sub-carrier","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)"]},{"kwd":["Wireless sensor network","neighbor discovery","time-of-arrival","sub-carrier","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7361/7181761/7131469-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Neighbor Discovery and Time of Arrival Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks via OFDMA","volume":"15","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7131469/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15360270","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 1101843"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Joint Neighbor Discovery and Time of Arrival Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks via OFDMA","sourcePdf":"jsen-jamalabdollahi-2449079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116396S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7181761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7181761","articleId":"7131469","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131470,"authors":[{"name":"Hailong Yao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"bio":{"p":["\nHailong Yao was a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the Department of \nComputer Science and Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, from August 2007 to August \n2009.

The goal is to train a model that is able to grade the pronunciation of a second language learner, such that the predicted score is as close as possible to the one given by a human teacher. Under this framework, each utterance is given a score of 1 to 5 by human raters, which is treated as a ground truth rank for the training algorithm. The corpus was rated by qualified English teachers in Taiwan (nonnative speakers). Nine phone-level scores are computed and converted into word-level scores through four conversion methods. We select the 16 best performing scores as the input features to train the learning-to-rank function. The output of the function is then quantized to a discrete rank on a 1-5 scale. The quantization is done with class normalization to alleviate the problem of data imbalance over different classes. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a higher correlation to the human scores than other methods, along with higher accuracy in detecting instances of mispronunciation. We also release a new version of our nonnative corpus with human rankings.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2015.2449089","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7140863/07131475.pdf","startPage":"1737","endPage":"1749","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2015.2449089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Pronunciation Scoring with Score Combination by Learning to Rank and Class-Normalized DP-Based Quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Pronunciation Scoring with Score Combination by Learning to Rank and Class-Normalized DP-Based Quantization","volume":"23","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7131475/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15272831","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Pronunciation Scoring with Score Combination by Learning to Rank and Class-Normalized DP-Based Quantization","sourcePdf":"taslp-chen-2449089-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083662S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7140863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7140863","articleId":"7131475","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131485,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Juan Cheng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7181761/7131485/cheng-2448617-small.gif","p":["Sheng-Juan Cheng received the B.E. degree in electronic information science and technology from Three Gorges University, Hubei, China, in 2012, and the M.E. degree in information and communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2015.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this process are not well understood, its performance under various load conditions has not been properly explored, and the requirements and benefits of (RLC) balance booster filters to enhance the natural balancing response are not clear. This paper presents a generalized model of an NPC natural balancing process that allows these issues to be explored for various load structures and balance booster configurations (i.e., isolated wye, wye with a grounded star point, etc.). The model accurately predicts the dominant balancing time constant, identifies the harmonics that drive the balancing process, and can quantify the steady-state balance booster losses for a designed target natural balance response. Extensive simulation and experimental tests have been performed to validate the theoretical model.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2015.2448618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/7331695/07131492.pdf","startPage":"4605","endPage":"4613","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2015.2448618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Natural Balance Model and Balance Booster Filter Design for Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Natural Balance Model and Balance Booster Filter Design for Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Converters","volume":"51","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7131492/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602081","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Natural Balance Model and Balance Booster Filter Design for Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Converters","sourcePdf":"tia-mcgrath-2448618-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051868S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7331695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7331695","articleId":"7131492","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131497,"authors":[{"name":"Vikram B.

With scaling of technology, manufacturing process variations in SRAMs are of significant concern. SRAM cells that are marginal due to process variations suffer from stability issues where random thermal noise and random telegraph noise (RTN) become determinant in memory state. This introduces uncertainty in testing, where passing a test does not necessarily mean that SRAM is good. A marginal cell may pass testing, but fail during operation. To address this problem, we introduce a new metric for probabilistic fault coverage. We present simulation methods for measuring such coverage and propose N-detect and multilevel wordline (WL) voltage techniques to increase the detection probability of marginal cells. We demonstrate the benefit of these testing approaches on a sample SRAM array, designed in 32 nm predictive technology models. To simulate marginal cells, we oversample the tail of the process variations distribution. Transient noise simulations show that thermal noise can lead to a fault coverage loss of 20% and RTN can lead to a maximum fault coverage loss of up to 75%. N-detect technique achieves close to a 100% fault coverage at n = 100 for thermal noise and n = 70 for RTN. Multilevel WL technique requires 20-30 mV boost in WL voltage during read test to achieve near ideal fault coverage at minimal yield loss. A combination of these techniques is shown to be effective in increasing fault coverage with a tradeoff between test time and yield loss.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing Test Coverage Uncertainty due to Random Noise in Nano-CMOS: A Case-Study on an SRAM Array","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2449236","startPage":"155","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2449236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7360959/07131497.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Managing Test Coverage Uncertainty due to Random Noise in Nano-CMOS: A Case-Study on an SRAM Array","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7131497/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669144","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing Test Coverage Uncertainty due to Random Noise in Nano-CMOS: A Case-Study on an SRAM Array","sourcePdf":"tcad-suresh-2449236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085258S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7360959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","xplore-issue":"7360959","articleId":"7131497","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131512,"authors":[{"name":"Erez Tadmor","affiliation":["Advanced Imaging Technologies Group, Microsoft Research and Development Center, Haifa, Israel","Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7365508/7131512/tadmo-2443056-small.gif","p":["Erez Tadmor received the B.Sc.

In order to meet the demands of such applications, it is important to have adaptive and self-reconfiguring hardware platforms, coupled with intelligent on-line optimization algorithms, that together can adjust to the run-time requirements. Partially dynamically reconfigurable field programmable gate array architectures offer both high performance and flexibility. Despite these potential advantages, the challenges faced by designers trying to set-up a functioning system are still significant, mainly because of the still immature design tools and limited device drivers. We propose a complete framework, based on Xilinx's commercial design suite, that enables an application designer to leverage the advantages of partial dynamic reconfiguration with minimal effort. Our IP-based architecture, together with the comprehensive application programming interface, can be employed to accelerate an application by dynamically scheduling hardware prefetches.

Our evaluation comprises of extensive simulations, as well as a complete implementation of the smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus image processing application on the ML605 board from Xilinx.

Exact thresholds on the sparsity, as a function of the ratio between the system dimensions, so that with high probability almost all sparse signals can be recovered from independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)

For signals where the nonsparse component entries are independent and identically drawn from certain classes of distributions, (including most well-known continuous distributions), we prove a strict improvement in the weak recovery threshold. Our analysis suggests that the level of improvement in the weak threshold depends on the behavior of the distribution at the origin. Numerical simulations verify the distribution dependence of the threshold improvement very well, and suggest that in the case of i.i.d. Gaussian nonzero entries, the improvement can be quite impressive-over 20% in the example we consider.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2448690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7203188/07131522.pdf","startPage":"5116","endPage":"5128","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2448690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Thresholds of Sparse Recovery: An Analysis of a Two-Step Reweighted Basis Pursuit Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Thresholds of Sparse Recovery: An Analysis of a Two-Step Reweighted Basis Pursuit Algorithm","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7131522/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15365054","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0729203, CNS-0932428 and CCF-1018927"},{"fundingName":"Office of Naval Research within the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative","grantNumber":"N00014-08-1-0747"},{"fundingName":"Caltech\u2019s Lee Center for Advanced Networking"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000893","fundingName":"Simons Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Iowa Energy Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Thresholds of Sparse Recovery: An Analysis of a Two-Step Reweighted Basis Pursuit Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tit-khajehnejad-2448690-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188314S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7203188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7203188","articleId":"7131522","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131527,"authors":[{"name":"Suqing Lin","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7181762/7131527/lin-2449264-small.gif","p":["Suqing Lin received the B.S. degree from Wenzhou Normal College, and the M.S. degree from Sichuan Normal University, China.

In order to reduce the decryption overhead for a user to recover the plaintext, Green et al. suggested to outsource the majority of the decryption work without revealing actually data or private keys. To ensure the third-party service honestly computes the outsourced work, Lai et al. provided a requirement of verifiability to the decryption of ABE, but their scheme doubled the size of the underlying ABE ciphertext and the computation costs. Roughly speaking, their main idea is to use a parallel encryption technique, while one of the encryption components is used for the verification purpose. Hence, the bandwidth and the computation cost are doubled. In this paper, we investigate the same problem. In particular, we propose a more efficient and generic construction of ABE with verifiable outsourced decryption based on an attribute-based key encapsulation mechanism, a symmetric-key encryption scheme and a commitment scheme. Then, we prove the security and the verification soundness of our constructed ABE scheme in the standard model. Finally, we instantiate our scheme with concrete building blocks. Compared with Lai et al.'s scheme, our scheme reduces the bandwidth and the computation costs almost by half.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7181762/07131527.pdf","startPage":"2119","endPage":"2130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2449264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2449264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting Attribute-Based Encryption With Verifiable Outsourced Decryption","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Encryption","Outsourcing","Access control","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","data encapsulation","parallel programming","private key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attribute-based encryption","verifiable outsourced decryption","fine-grained access control","encrypted data","cloud storage","resource-constrained front-end users","decryption overhead reduction","plaintext recovery","private keys","third-party service","verifiability requirement","ABE decryption","ABE ciphertext","computation cost","parallel encryption technique","encryption components","attribute-based key encapsulation mechanism","symmetric-key encryption scheme","commitment scheme","security proof","verification soundness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attribute-based encryption","outsourced decryption","verifiability","access control"]},{"kwd":["Attribute-based encryption","outsourced decryption","verifiability","access control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting Attribute-Based Encryption With Verifiable Outsourced Decryption","volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7131527/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15359375","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Foundation of Science and Technology on Information Assurance Laboratory","grantNumber":"KJ-14-002"},{"fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program through the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, (CAS)","grantNumber":"XDA06010703 and XDA06010701"},{"fundingName":"One Hundred Talents Project through CAS"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272478, 61472416, 61379142 and 61402468"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Governmental Research","grantNumber":"ZDSY20130402095348589 and JSGG20130624154032565"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting Attribute-Based Encryption With Verifiable Outsourced Decryption","sourcePdf":"tifs-zhang-2449264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148672S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7181762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7181762","articleId":"7131527","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131531,"authors":[{"name":"Durga Prasad Sahoo","affiliation":["Secured Embedded Architecture Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7166378/7131531/sahoo-2448677-small.gif","p":["Durga Prasad Sahoo (GSM\u201914) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and M.Tech. degrees in computer science from the University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India, in 2007, 2009, and 2011, respectively.

It is desirable that silicon PUF circuits should be lightweight, i.e., have low-hardware resource requirements. However, it is also of primary importance that such demands of low hardware overhead should not compromise the security aspects of PUF circuits. In this paper, we develop two different mathematical attacks on previously proposed lightweight PUF circuits, namely composite PUF and the multibit output lightweight secure PUF (LSPUF). We show that independence of various components of composite PUF can be used to develop divide and conquer attacks which can be used to determine the responses to unknown challenges. We reduce the complexity of the attack using a machine learning-based modeling analysis. In addition, we elucidate a special property of the output network of LSPUF to show how such feature can be leveraged by an adversary to perform an intelligent model building attack. The theoretical inferences are validated through experimental results. More specifically, proposed attacks on composite PUF are validated using the challenge-response pairs (CRPs) from its field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation, and attack on LSPUF is validated using the CRPs of both simulated and FPGA implemented LSPUF.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Case of Lightweight PUF Constructions: Cryptanalysis and Machine Learning Attacks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448677","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7166378/07131531.pdf","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7166378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Case of Lightweight PUF Constructions: Cryptanalysis and Machine Learning Attacks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7131531/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15310623","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Case of Lightweight PUF Constructions: Cryptanalysis and Machine Learning Attacks","sourcePdf":"tcad-sahoo-2448677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093912S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7166378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7166378","articleId":"7131531","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131534,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Grossi","affiliation":["Department of Ingegneria ENDIF, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7163647/7131534/gross-2442412-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Grossi received the M.Sc. degree in electronic and telecommunications engineering from the Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in engineering science with the Department of Engineering."]},"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Grossi","id":"37346759100"},{"name":"Damian Walczyk","affiliation":["Innovations for High Performance Microelectronics, Frankfurt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7163647/7131534/walcz-2442412-small.gif","p":["Damian Walczyk (S\u201906\u2013M\u201910) received the Dipl.- Ing.

The optimal tracking problem is transformed into an equivalent optimal regulation problem through a feedforward adaptive control input that is generated by modifying the standard backstepping technique. Subsequently, a neural network-based optimal control scheme is introduced to estimate the cost, or value function, over an infinite horizon for the resulting nonlinear continuous-time systems in affine form when the internal dynamics are unknown. The estimated cost function is then used to obtain the optimal feedback control input; therefore, the overall optimal control input for the nonlinear continuous-time system in strict-feedback form includes the feedforward plus the optimal feedback terms. It is shown that the estimated cost function minimizes the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman estimation error in a forward-in-time manner without using any value or policy iterations. Finally, optimal output feedback control is introduced through the design of a suitable observer. Lyapunov theory is utilized to show the overall stability of the proposed schemes without requiring an initial admissible controller. Simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Control of Nonlinear Continuous-Time Systems in Strict-Feedback Form","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2441712","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7287875/07131539.pdf","startPage":"2535","endPage":"2549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2441712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Control of Nonlinear Continuous-Time Systems in Strict-Feedback Form","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7131539/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15488940","pubMedId":"26111400","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 0901562"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Control of Nonlinear Continuous-Time Systems in Strict-Feedback Form","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zargarzadeh-2441712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09482S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7287875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7287875","articleId":"7131539","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131541,"authors":[{"name":"Sajjad Beygi","affiliation":["University of Southern California, School of Electrical Engineering"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7182811/7131541/7131541-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sajjad Beygi (S\u201915) is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of Southern California.

Realization of such systems will require vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology. High fidelity V2V communication is, in turn, dependent on accurate V2V channel estimation. V2V channels have characteristics differing from classical cellular communication channels. Herein, geometry-based stochastic modeling is employed to develop a characterization of V2V channel channels. The resultant model exhibits significant structure; specifically, the V2V channel is characterized by three distinct regions within the delay-Doppler plane. Each region has a unique combination of specular reflections and diffuse components resulting in a particular element-wise and group-wise sparsity. This joint sparsity structure is exploited to develop a novel channel estimation algorithm. A general machinery is provided to solve the jointly element/group sparse channel (signal) estimation problem using proximity operators of a broad class of regularizers. The alternating direction method of multipliers using the proximity operator is adapted to optimize the mixed objective function. Key properties of the proposed objective functions are proven which ensure that the optimal solution is found by the new algorithm. The effects of pulse shape leakage are explicitly characterized and compensated, resulting in measurably improved performance. Numerical simulation and real V2V channel measurement data are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that the new method can achieve significant gains over previously proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2449256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7182811/07131541.pdf","startPage":"4940","endPage":"4955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2449256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nested Sparse Approximation: Structured Estimation of V2V Channels Using Geometry-Based Stochastic Channel Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131541/","displayDocTitle":"Nested Sparse Approximation: Structured Estimation of V2V Channels Using Geometry-Based Stochastic Channel Model","volume":"63","issue":"18","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15379285","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131541/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"Division of Computing and Communication Foundations","grantNumber":"CCF-1117896 and CCF-1410009"},{"fundingName":"Adlerbert Research Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Ericssons Research Foundation","grantNumber":"FOSTIFT-13:038"},{"fundingName":"Barbro Osher Pro Suecia Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-12-1-0215"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"Division of Computer and Network Systems","grantNumber":"CNS-1213128 and CPS-1446901"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-09-1-0700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004811","fundingName":"California Department of Transportation","grantNumber":"CA-26-7084-00"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nested Sparse Approximation: Structured Estimation of V2V Channels Using Geometry-Based Stochastic Channel Model","sourcePdf":"tsp-beygiharchegani-2449256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117766S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7182811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7182811","articleId":"7131541","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131549,"authors":[{"name":"Ali H.

We also propose a novel set of features that aim at reducing the impact of force level variations on the prosthesis controlled by amputees. These features characterize the EMG activity by means of the orientation between a set of spectral moments descriptors extracted from the EMG signal and a nonlinearly mapped version of it. At the same time, our feature extraction method processes the EMG signals directly from the time-domain to reduce computational cost. The performance of the proposed features is tested on EMG data collected from nine transradial amputees performing six classes of movements each with three force levels. Our results indicate that the proposed features can achieve significant reductions in classification error rates in comparison to other well-known feature extraction methods, achieving improvements of \u2248 6% to 8% in the average classification performance across all subjects and force levels, when training with all forces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7131549/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16073296","pubMedId":"26111399","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Performance Against Force Variation of EMG Controlled Multifunctional Upper-Limb Prostheses for Transradial Amputees","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research Iraq"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Performance Against Force Variation of EMG Controlled Multifunctional Upper-Limb Prostheses for Transradial Amputees","sourcePdf":"tnsre-altimemy-2445634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07753S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"7491402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"7491402","articleId":"7131549","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":7131562,"authors":[{"name":"Sithan Kanna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6884276/7110704/7131562/kanna-2442834-small.gif","p":["Sithan Kanna (S\u201913) received the M.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering with management from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2012.

Special care is needed to limit system performance degradation when multiple multicast streams are simultaneously transmitted. To this aim, this paper proposes an RRM policy based on a subgrouping technique for the delivery of scalable multicast video flows in a cell. Our proposal enhances the legacy multicast transmission over LTE systems by exploiting multiuser diversity and the users' channel quality feedbacks. Moreover, it is designed to take advantage of the frequency selectivity in the subgroup formation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which outperforms existing approaches from the literature. It succeeds in achieving higher spectral efficiency and guaranteeing adequate video quality to all multicast receivers and improved quality to those with good channel conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicast Resource Allocation Enhanced by Channel State Feedbacks for Multiple Scalable Video Coding Streams in LTE Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2449080","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7469422/07131571.pdf","startPage":"2907","endPage":"2921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2449080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469422","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"Multicast Resource Allocation Enhanced by Channel State Feedbacks for Multiple Scalable Video Coding Streams in LTE Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7131571/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15988950","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004895","fundingName":"European Social Fund"},{"fundingName":"Calabria Regional Government"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicast Resource Allocation Enhanced by Channel State Feedbacks for Multiple Scalable Video Coding Streams in LTE Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-condoluci-2449080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135023S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7469422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7469422","articleId":"7131571","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7131574,"authors":[{"name":"Jaya B.

This paper develops a framework for analyzing the SE and EE of a two-tier heterogeneous cellular network consisting of macrocell and femtocell base stations (BSs) operating under a shared-spectrum scenario. It is shown that both the SE and the EE can be significantly enhanced with the overlaid deployment of the femto tier. However, the performance gain achievable is found to be strongly dependent on the load level and the BS power consumption attributes. A multiobjective optimization problem that maximizes the SE and the EE subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints is formulated and solved to give the Pareto-optimal operational regime. The novelty of this work is the quantification of the SE-EE tradeoff as a Lebesgue measure, which is defined by the Pareto-optimal regime. The developed framework is useful for studying the impact of the load on the SE-EE tradeoff, based on a strategy that exploits the varying load conditions to achieve good balance in the SE-EE tradeoff is formulated. Numerical results show that, while the improvement achieved in minimizing the SE-EE performance gap is marginal under high-load conditions, it is feasible to significantly increase the SE and the EE during low-load conditions and satisfy the users' QoS requirements by optimally adapting the density of the femto-tier BSs accessing the shared spectrum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7131574/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2016","accessionNumber":"15988914","volume":"65","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Framework for Evaluating Spectrum/Energy Efficiency of Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Framework for Evaluating Spectrum/Energy Efficiency of Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-rao-2448593-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107258S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7469422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7469422","articleId":"7131574","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7131575,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","Qamcom Research & Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7177154/7131575/7131575-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez-P\u00e9rez received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain in 2012.","From September 2012 to December 2014, he was a Postdoc with the Microwave Electronics Laboratory, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.

First, the topology for the output matching network (OMN) including the control varactor is selected. A comprehensive optimization of the OMN parameters is then developed by which varactor and transistor losses are considered to ensure maximum efficiency enhancement at each frequency. To verify the method, a dual-band PA with DLM is realized. Drain efficiencies of 75% and 60% at 685 MHz and 1.84 GHz, respectively, are measured at peak output power. At 10-dB output power back-off efficiencies of 43.5% and 49.5%, respectively, are obtained. Linearized modulated measurements with a 6.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio WCDMA signal show average drain efficiencies of 56% and 54% at 685 MHz and 1.84 GHz, respectively, at an adjacent channel leakage ratio of -49 and -47.5 dBc, respectively. The proposed method shows the effectiveness of applying an optimization process for the design of single- or multi-band DLM PAs. The results demonstrate that near-optimum performance may be obtained in terms of efficiency enhancement for a given transistor and varactor-based OMN, thus making DLM competitive against other load modulation techniques.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7177154/07131575.pdf","startPage":"2579","endPage":"2588","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2442985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2442985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Design of a Dual-Band Power Amplifier With SiC Varactor-Based Dynamic Load Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Design of a Dual-Band Power Amplifier With SiC Varactor-Based Dynamic Load Modulation","htmlLink":"/document/7131575/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15346086","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Design of a Dual-Band Power Amplifier With SiC Varactor-Based Dynamic Load Modulation","sourcePdf":"tmtt-sanchezperez-2442985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092629S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7177154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7177154","articleId":"7131575","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7131580,"authors":[{"name":"Sajjad Beygi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7182811/7131580/7131580-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sajjad Beygi (S\u201915) is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of Southern California.

The MSML channel model is a good representation for wideband communication channels, such as underwater acoustic communication and radar. This model is characterized by a limited number of paths, each parameterized by a delay, Doppler scale, and attenuation factor. Herein, it is shown that an OFDM signal after passing through the MSML channel exhibits a low rank representation. This feature can be exploited to improve the channel estimation. By characterizing the received signal, it is shown that the MSML channel estimation problem can be adapted to a structured spectral estimation problem. The challenge is that the unknown frequencies are very close to each other due to the small values of Doppler scales. This feature can be employed to show that the data matrix is approximately low-rank. By exploiting structural features of the received signal, the Prony algorithm is modified to estimate the Doppler scales (close frequencies), delays and channel gains. Two strategies using convex and no-convex regularizers to remove noise from the corrupted signal are proposed. These algorithms are iterative based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. A bound on the reconstruction of the noiseless received signal provides guidance on the selection of the relaxation parameter in the optimizations. The performance of the proposed estimation strategies are investigated via numerical simulations, and it is shown that the proposed non-convex method offers up to 7 dB improvement in low SNR and the convex method offers up to 5 dB improvement in high SNR over prior methods for the MSML channel estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Scale Multi-Lag Channel Estimation Using Low Rank Approximation for OFDM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2449266","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7182811/07131580.pdf","startPage":"4744","endPage":"4755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2449266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131580","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7182811/7131580-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131580/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Scale Multi-Lag Channel Estimation Using Low Rank Approximation for OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/7131580/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15364441","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-09-1-0700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0917343, CNS-0832186, CCF-1117896 and CNS- 1213128"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-12-1- 0215"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Multi-Scale Multi-Lag Channel Estimation Using Low Rank Approximation for OFDM","sourcePdf":"tsp-beygiharchegani-2449266-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127335S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7182811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7182811","articleId":"7131580","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131581,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Sen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, R.O.C., Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7217861/7131581/7131581-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Po-Sen Wang (S\u201908) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1994 and 1996, respectively.","From 1996 to 2000, he was with Industrial Technology Research Institute.

We consider ML blind synchronization over wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channels. Different from existing studies, we exploit a more complete signal correlation function and find the carrier frequency offset estimate to be the solution of a quartic equation, rather than the phase angle of a complex number. As the truly ML synchronizer (dubbed MLE) is very complicated, we also derive a reduced-complexity alternative (dubbed RCE). It is found that the RCE yields indistinguishable performance from the MLE, at a somewhat lower complexity than an existing rival. We also present an in-depth theoretical analysis and comparison of the performance of various methods. Simulations show that the proposed methods yield rather robust performance in modeling errors of the fading rate and the channel power-delay profile (PDP).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Maximum-Likelihood Blind Synchronization Over WSSUS Channels for OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2449253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7217861/07131581.pdf","startPage":"5045","endPage":"5059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2449253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131581/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2015","displayDocTitle":"On Maximum-Likelihood Blind Synchronization Over WSSUS Channels for OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"19","htmlLink":"/document/7131581/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2015","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15411931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Maximum-Likelihood Blind Synchronization Over WSSUS Channels for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2449253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121819S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7217861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7217861","articleId":"7131581","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131584,"authors":[{"name":"Viki Szortyka","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","imec, Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7226885/7131584/7131584-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Viki Szortyka received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.","In 2008 and 2009, he was with Evatronix, Poland.

The sub-sampling phase detector (SSPD) runs at 30 GHz after an inductively-peaked static divide-by-two.

A dummy divider of the quadrature PLL is utilized for the sub-sampling loop to avoid extra loading in the 60 GHz path.

Differently from the conventional cooperative approaches, where the secondary base station (SBS) takes a decision on the busy/idle status of the primary user and transmits with constant/binary power, the proposed approach allows the SBS to transmit with power as a continuous function of the detection information vector. We treat the cases of lossless-compression and hard-decision information separately. Optimal sensing time, detection threshold, and power allocation are derived to maximize the achievable rate at the SBS. In this paper, we only consider the case where secondary users (SUs) are merely receivers, and the SBS uses the allocated power to communicate with the SUs; however, the conclusions can also be expanded to the case where SUs use the allocated power under the assumption of a common control channel to exchange the information between the SBS and SUs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the performance of the SBS compared with the conventional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2442436","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7469422/07131585.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2442436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"3760","endPage":"3764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative-Generalized-Sensing-Based Spectrum Sharing Approach for Centralized Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative-Generalized-Sensing-Based Spectrum Sharing Approach for Centralized Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131585/","volume":"65","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7131585/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15988938","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422109 and 61201187"},{"fundingName":"Importation and Development of High-Caliber Talents Project of Beijing Municipal Institutions","grantNumber":"YETP0110"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"20121088074"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative-Generalized-Sensing-Based Spectrum Sharing Approach for Centralized Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2442436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07609S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7469422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7469422","articleId":"7131585","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7131587,"authors":[{"name":"Yasmin Halawani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"bio":{"p":["Yasmin Halawani (M\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, in 2014, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Her research project focused on investigating the suitability of emerging memory technologies, such as memristor and STT-RAM for low power applications."]},"firstName":"Yasmin","lastName":"Halawani","id":"37085544769"},{"name":"Baker Mohammad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7416268/7131587/moham-2440392-small.gif","p":["Baker Mohammad (M\u201904\u2013SM\u201913) received the B.S. degree from the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA, the M.S. degree from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 2008, all in electronics and communication engineering.","He was involved in a wide range of microprocessors design from high performance, server chips >100 W (IA-64), to mobile embedded processor low power sub-1 watt (XScale) with Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA.

Some of these challenges are leakage current for static random access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random access memory (DRAM), additional refresh operation for DRAM, and high programming voltage for Flash. In this paper, two emerging resistive random access memory (ReRAM) technologies are investigated, memristor and spin-transfer torque (STT)-RAM, as potential universal memory candidates to replace traditional ones. Both of these nonvolatile memories support zero leakage and low-voltage operation during read access, which makes them ideal for devices with long sleep time. To date, high write energy for both memristor and STT-RAM is one of the major inhibitors for adopting the technologies. The primary contribution of this paper is centered on addressing the high write energy issue by trading off retention time with noise margin. In doing so, the memristor and STT-RAM power has been compared with the traditional six-transistor-SRAM-based memory power and potential application in wireless sensor nodes is explored. This paper uses 45-nm foundry process technology data for SRAM and physics-based mathematical models derived from real devices for memristor and STT-RAM. The simulations are conducted using MATLAB and the results show a potential power savings of 87% and 77% when using memristor and STT-RAM, respectively, at 1% duty cycle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","volume":"24","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15803139","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7131587/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Optimization of Memristor and STT-RAM-Based Memory for Low-Power Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Optimization of Memristor and STT-RAM-Based Memory for Low-Power Applications","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-halawani-2440392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141579S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7416268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7416268","articleId":"7131587","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7131589,"authors":[{"name":"Yijun Chen","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Qun Zhang","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Ning Yuan","affiliation":["RF Electromagnetic Engineer in Qualcomm, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Yuan"},{"name":"Ying Luo","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Luo"},{"name":"Hao Lou","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lou"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"7131589","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1135},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","Imaging","Radar tracking","Resource management","Signal processing algorithms","Scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","optimisation","phased array radar","radar imaging","resource allocation","scheduling","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive ISAR imaging","task scheduling algorithm","multifunction phased array radar systems","MFPAR systems","time resource allocation","energy resource allocation","radar resource allocation","sparse-aperture ISAR compressive sensing cognitive imaging techniques","target imaging","online target characteristics cognition","radar efficiency improvement","resource scheduling optimization model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive task scheduling algorithm","compressed sensing","inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging","phased array radar"]}],"abstract":"In multi-function phased array radar (MFPAR) systems, time and energy resources are allocated for different tasks so that the radar can perform various missions simultaneously. An effective scheduling algorithm is crucial to optimizing the overall performance of the MFPAR. There are various existing adaptive resource scheduling methods for the allocation of radar resources, but none of them consider the mission of imaging, a very important task. In this paper, an adaptive ISAR-imaging-considered task scheduling algorithm is proposed. Based on the sparse-aperture ISAR Compressive Sensing (CS) cognitive imaging techniques, the required resources for target imaging can be calculated from the online cognition of the target characteristics. Then the imaging mission is considered in the resource scheduling optimization model to realize adaptive allocation of radar resources and high-resolution imaging of multi targets. With the proposed algorithm, different tasks, such as tracking, searching and imaging, etc. can be implemented simultaneously, thus the radar efficiency is significantly improved. The effectiveness of the proposed method will be demonstrated by simulation experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive ISAR-Imaging-Considered Task Scheduling Algorithm for Multi-Function Phased Array Radars","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2449251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7217861/07131589.pdf","startPage":"5096","endPage":"5110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2449251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131589/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2015","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive ISAR-Imaging-Considered Task Scheduling Algorithm for Multi-Function Phased Array Radars","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"19","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15411930","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172169 and 61201369"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Adaptive ISAR-Imaging-Considered Task Scheduling Algorithm for Multi-Function Phased Array Radars","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2449251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059013S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2015","isNumber":"7217861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","articleId":"7131589","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7131591,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjia Cui","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7469422/7131591/cui-2448659-small.gif","p":["\n\nWenjia Cui received the B.S. degree in 2013 from Huazhong University of \nScience and Technology, Wuhan, China, where she is currently working toward the M.S. degree.","Her current research interests include wireless communications, particularly for filter-bank multicarrier systems \nwith emphasis on channel estimation."]},"firstName":"Wenjia","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085821910"},{"name":"Daiming Qu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7469422/7131591/qu-2448659-small.gif","p":["\n\nDaiming Qu received the Ph.D. degree in information and communication \nengineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2003.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of \nScience and Technology.

We refer to this as the coded auxiliary pilot (CAP) method. It builds on the idea of using a few auxiliary pilot (AP) symbols to eliminate the imaginary interference on each scattered pilot. At the same time, to keep the spectral efficiency of transmission high, the AP symbols are coded to also carry information symbols. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the CAP method can maintain high spectral efficiency and high power efficiency, while achieving complete imaginary interference cancelation. Taking the spectral and power efficiency, the imaginary interference cancelation performance, and the coding/decoding complexity into consideration, the CAP method with two to four AP symbols is identified as a good compromised choice for practice.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2448659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2448659","startPage":"2936","endPage":"2946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7469422/07131591.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Auxiliary Pilots for Channel Estimation in FBMC-OQAM Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coded Auxiliary Pilots for Channel Estimation in FBMC-OQAM Systems","volume":"65","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2016","accessionNumber":"15988915","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7131591/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Development 863 Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A710 and 2014AA01A704"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61325004"},{"fundingName":"Key Program Research Plan of National Natural Science Foundation of Hubei in China","grantNumber":"2013CFA055"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Auxiliary Pilots for Channel Estimation in FBMC-OQAM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-qu-2448659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126885S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7469422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7469422","articleId":"7131591","onlineDate":"23 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7131692,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Khalili","affiliation":["School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Khalili","id":"37085410575"},{"name":"Kang L.

Owing to high PMUs installation costs, developing optimal strategy of PMUs placement is important to monitor the transmission system status in the wide area. To characterize the performance of line outage identification, this paper firstly proposes the statistical model to describe the average identification capability of multiple line outages. Using this model, we develop a global optimal PMUs placement strategy to maximize the average identification capability under the budget of PMUs. Furthermore, a greedy heuristic strategy is developed to bypass the combinatorial search to achieve a sub-optimal solution at a reduced complexity. The proposed methods are used to benchmark the optimal PMU placement solutions for the IEEE 14- and 57-bus systems. The experimental study demonstrates that the proposed techniques successfully select optimal PMU locations, targeting on maximum the average identification capability. The result shows that the proposed PMUs placement strategies improve about 10% location identification performance of multiple line outages when compared to random PMUs placement method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15239600","htmlLink":"/document/7131850/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal selected phasor measurement units for identifying multiple line outages in smart grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal selected phasor measurement units for identifying multiple line outages in smart grid","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2015000134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063993S","chronDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7118474","isNumber":"7131775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7118474","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7131775","articleId":"7131850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7131877,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Pignati","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Pignati","id":"37085386357"},{"name":"Miroslav Popovic","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Popovic","id":"37077334800"},{"name":"Sergio Barreto","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Barreto","id":"37085383004"},{"name":"Rachid Cherkaoui","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Cherkaoui","id":"37272326300"},{"name":"German Dario Flores","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"German","lastName":"Dario Flores","id":"37088706787"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Le Boudec","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Le Boudec","id":"37283370900"},{"name":"Maaz Mohiuddin","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Maaz","lastName":"Mohiuddin","id":"37073283900"},{"name":"Mario Paolone","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Paolone","id":"37275860500"},{"name":"Paolo Romano","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Romano","id":"37085343912"},{"name":"Styliani Sarri","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Styliani","lastName":"Sarri","id":"38552815500"},{"name":"Teklemariam Tesfay","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Teklemariam","lastName":"Tesfay","id":"37085382578"},{"name":"Dan-Cristian Tomozei","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dan-Cristian","lastName":"Tomozei","id":"37400305500"},{"name":"Lorenzo Zanni","affiliation":["DESL & LCA2 labs, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Zanni","id":"37085375570"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1785-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7131877","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":914},"abstract":"We describe the real-time monitoring infrastructure of the smart-grid pilot on the EPFL campus.

We designed and put into operation the whole infrastructure composed by the following main elements: (1) dedicated PMUs connected on the medium-voltage side of the network secondary substations by means of specific current/voltage transducers; (2) a dedicated communication network engineered to support stringent time limits and (3) an innovative state estimation process for real-time monitoring that incorporates phasor-data concentration and state estimation processes. Special care was taken to make the whole chain resilient to cyber-attacks, equipment failures and power outages. The achieved latency is within 65ms. The refresh rate of the estimated state is 20ms. The real-time visualization of the state estimator output is made publicly available, as well as the historical data (PMU measurements and estimated states). To the best of our knowledge, the work presented here is the first operational system that provides low-latency real-time state-estimation by using PMU measurements of a real active distribution

Uncertainty introduced by stochastic time delay increases the difficulty of modeling and stability analysis. In this paper, a new approach of stability analysis through expectation model is proposed to solve the problem of uncertainty in wide-area controlled power systems considering the effect of stochastic time delay. In the proposed method, expectation model considering detailed stochastic time delay distribution is derived to accurately model the impact of communication network on wide-area control performance. Then, through matrix transformation of expectation model, eigenvalue of wide-area damping control system considering time delay can be calculated, which can be used for analyzing the system stability. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through the simulation of a power system with 8 generators and 36 nodes with different types of time delay distribution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7131893/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15301356","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of wide-area damping control system with stochastic communication time delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of wide-area damping control system with stochastic communication time delay","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2015000011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052318S","chronDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7118474","isNumber":"7131775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7118474","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7131775","articleId":"7131893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7131912,"authors":[{"name":"Chenye Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chenye","lastName":"Wu","id":"38238337100"},{"name":"Gabriela Hug","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Gabriela","lastName":"Hug","id":"38468767400"},{"name":"Soummya Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Soummya","lastName":"Kar","id":"37295115000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1785-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7131912","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","Generators","Electricity supply industry","Optimization","Power systems","Real-time systems","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power markets","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible ramping products impact","electricity market","optimal energy dispatch","renewable penetration level","maximal distortion cost","renewable energy resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flexible ramp market","real time market","renewable energy integration","parametric optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131912","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2015.7131912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2015.7131912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131775","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7118474/7131775/07131912.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A functional approach to assessing flexible ramping products' impact on electricity market","abstract":"The expected increase in penetration of renewables in the upcoming decade urges the electricity market to introduce new products - in particular, flexible ramping products - to accommodate their variability and intermittency. While CAISO and MISO are leading the design, it is not clear how such products may affect the electricity market. There has been extensive works investigating the cost incurred by variability and intermittency of renewables. In this paper, however, we are specifically interested in assessing how the new products distort the optimal energy dispatch by comparing to the case without such products. Such distortion may impose additional cost, which we term as the \u201cdistortion cost\u201d. Using a functional approach, we establish the relationship between the distortion cost and the key parameters of the new products, i.e., the up and down flexible ramping requirements. Such relationship provides valuable information in assessing the trend of the distortion cost with respect to the renewable penetration level. Fortunately, both theoretical analysis and simulation results suggest smartly choosing the parameters may significantly reduce the additional cost by avoiding the maximal distortion cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7131912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7131912/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15322938","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A functional approach to assessing flexible ramping products' impact on electricity market","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A functional approach to assessing flexible ramping products' impact on electricity market","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2015000046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051922S","chronDate":"18-20 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7118474","isNumber":"7131775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7118474","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7131775","articleId":"7131912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7131956,"authors":[{"name":"Shien-Kuei Liaw","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shien-Kuei","lastName":"Liaw","id":"37302630400"},{"name":"H-H Chou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"H-H","lastName":"Chou","id":"37405554400"},{"name":"Chun-Jui Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Jui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085501413"},{"name":"Ming-Jen Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Jen","lastName":"Chien","id":"37085479293"},{"name":"Chiang Teng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiang","lastName":"Teng","id":"37085488369"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4208-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8593"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-8607"}],"articleNumber":"7131956","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131956","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Modulation","Bandwidth","Bit error rate","Data communication","Light sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","error statistics","light emitting diodes","optical communication","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communications system","RGB-based LED","LED","microprojection application","system modulation bandwidth","data transmission tests","OOK modulation scheme","offline signal processing","bandwidth 35 MHz to 188.5 MHz","bit rate 500 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visible light communications","LED","equazitation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISNE.2015.7131956","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Next-Generation Electronics (ISNE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Next-Generation Electronics (ISNE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124302/7131937/07131956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNE.2015.7131956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"500 Mb/s OOK visible light communications using RGB-based LEDs","abstract":"We have experimentally implemented a short-range visible light communication system based on the use of RGB-based LED which has widely employed as the light source in portable device for micro-projection application.

Our objective is to maximize the capacity, which leads to a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. To resolve this complicated MIP problem with reasonable cost, we propose a new heterogeneous genetic algorithm (HGA), where each chromosome is divided into a bit string for precoding vector selection, an integer string for transmit antenna selection, and a real number string for power allocation. In addition, new crossover and mutation operations are employed to accommodate these new chromosomes.

However, currently available FPGA architecture presents waste under a parallel operation in terms of configuration memory because the same configuration context corresponding to same-function modules must be programmed onto numerous parts of configuration memory. This paper therefore presents a proposal for a parallel-operation-oriented FPGA architecture including a shared common configuration memory. In this research, a parallel-operation-oriented FPGA with four programmable gate arrays sharing a common configuration memory has been designed using a 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process technology. The advantage of the parallel-operation-oriented FPGA is clarified and a design technique to achieve a high-performance parallel-operation-oriented FPGA is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ISNE.2015.7132021","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Next-Generation Electronics (ISNE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Next-Generation Electronics (ISNE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124302/7131937/07132021.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNE.2015.7132021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a parallel-operation-oriented FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132021/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a parallel-operation-oriented FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7132021/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"4-6 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240692","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a parallel-operation-oriented FPGA","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"270300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049538S","chronDate":"4-6 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124302","isNumber":"7131937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124302","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7131937","articleId":"7132021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7132022,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Tang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Kao Yuan University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Tang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37405391600"},{"name":"Chung-Wei Tsailin","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communications and Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Wei","lastName":"Tsailin","id":"37085523021"},{"name":"Yen-Chung Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communications and Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chung","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085517518"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4208-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8593"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-8607"}],"articleNumber":"7132022","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Shift registers","Heuristic algorithms","Encryption","Optical switches","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arrayed waveguide gratings","code division multiplexing","cryptography","decoding","encoding","m-sequences","optical chaos","optical communication equipment","optical control","optical switches","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWG","arrayed waveguide gratings","integrated chaos/M-sequence mapping algorithm","secure transmission","optical code division multiple access","OCDMA","dynamic reconfigurable coding","dynamic reconfigurable decoding","encryption","decryption","chaos sequence","optical switch control","pseudorandom time","maximum period time","security mechanism","M-sequence codeword","eavesdropper","electrical shift register processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arrayed-waveguide-grating (AWG) routers","Optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA)","Dynamic reconfigurable Encryption/Decryption","Integrated chaos/M-sequence mapping algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In order to enhance the confidentiality of AWG-based optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) scheme, the dynamic reconfigurable coding/decoding scheme based on chaos sequence is proposed to control optical switches and simple electrical shift registers. Since the chaos sequence is characterized with the property of pseudo random and maximum period time, the security mechanism of changing M-sequence codeword is implemented to avoid the tracking and attacking of unauthorized users (i.e., eavesdropper). Hence, The OCDMA system only needs to transmit the major parameter (e.g., initial condition and specified parameter) replacing the transmission of complex and mass encrypted key. In addition, the average changing step of proposed chaos/M-sequence mapping algorithm (i.e., 0.3<;variable slope <;0.4) is significantly much less than this of the linear function (i.e., variable slope =1) with electrical shift register processing. Hence, the proposed chaos/M-sequence algorithm is more simple, flexible and easy to implement in AWG-based OCDMA system compared to conventional scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ISNE.2015.7132022","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Next-Generation Electronics (ISNE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Next-Generation Electronics (ISNE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124302/7131937/07132022.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNE.2015.7132022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic reconfigurable AWG-based encryption and decryption with integrated chaos/M-sequence mapping algorithm for secure transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132022/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic reconfigurable AWG-based encryption and decryption with integrated chaos/M-sequence mapping algorithm for secure transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240731","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7132022/","conferenceDate":"4-6 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic reconfigurable AWG-based encryption and decryption with integrated chaos/M-sequence mapping algorithm for secure transmission","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"270128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042401S","chronDate":"4-6 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124302","isNumber":"7131937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124302","xplore-issue":"7131937","articleId":"7132022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7132027,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Prakash","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Prakash","id":"37085366131"},{"name":"J-S.

A novel method is proposed to reduce the peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR), which is commonly used to evaluate the fluctuation. The proposed method is based on the tone reservation approach, in which some bits or subcarriers of OFDM are allocated for decreasing PMEPR. We introduce the coefficient of variation of envelopes (CVE) as the cost function for waveform optimization, and develop an iterative least squares algorithm. Minimizing CVE leads to distinct PMEPR reduction, and it is guaranteed that the cost function monotonically decreases by applying the iterative algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the envelope is significantly smoothed by the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low PMEPR OFDM Radar Waveform Design Using the Iterative Least Squares Algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2015.2449305","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7118269/07132704.pdf","startPage":"1975","endPage":"1979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2015.2449305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7118269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Low PMEPR OFDM Radar Waveform Design Using the Iterative Least Squares Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7132704/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15270787","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low PMEPR OFDM Radar Waveform Design Using the Iterative Least Squares Algorithm","sourcePdf":"lsp-huang-2449305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044903S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7118269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7118269","articleId":"7132704","onlineDate":"24 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7132706,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon M.

We consider the circuit power consumption in this letter and hence the optimization of the number of active RF chains is necessary. In particular, a greedy relay AS algorithm is proposed to avoid the exhaustive search. The proposed algorithm relies on a derived equation for the sum rate of AF MIMO TWRCs when relay AS is adopted, which guides us to select a pair of receive and transmit antennas that brings the largest sum rate increment at each selection. Simulation results show that the greedy algorithm is capable of achieving nearly the same performance of exhaustive search but with significantly reduced computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7265139/07132714.pdf","startPage":"1648","endPage":"1651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications

Together with the inter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by high mobility, equalizing one subcarrier now depends not only on whether interference exists, but also the neighboring subcarrier data. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to iteratively learn the statistics of noise plus interference across different subcarriers, and refine the soft data estimates of each subcarrier based on the variational inference. Simulation results show that the proposed method avoids the error floor effect, which is exhibited by existing algorithms without considering interference mitigation, and performs close to the ideal case with perfect ICI cancelation and knowledge of noise plus interference powers for optimal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) equalizer.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2015.2449658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7118269/07132716.pdf","startPage":"1970","endPage":"1974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2015.2449658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7118269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Inference-based Joint Interference Mitigation and OFDM Equalization Under High Mobility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132716/","displayDocTitle":"Variational Inference-based Joint Interference Mitigation and OFDM Equalization Under High Mobility","volume":"22","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15270789","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7132716/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014A030310374, 2014A030311032 and 2014A030313111"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61173148, 61202498 and 61472458"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Inference-based Joint Interference Mitigation and OFDM Equalization Under High Mobility","sourcePdf":"lsp-zhou-2449658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062399S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7118269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7118269","articleId":"7132716","onlineDate":"24 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7132724,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Fang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085450608"},{"name":"Zuping Qian","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zuping","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085450548"},{"name":"Wei Zhong","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37405601900"},{"name":"Wei Shao","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Shao","id":"37085430437"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7132724","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1000},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we study the secrecy precoding problem for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. We adopt an artificial noise (AN)-aided precoding scheme and formulate the problem as a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem, which is subject to both an interference power constraint imposed to protect the primary user (PU) and an energy harvesting constraint required by the secondary energy receiver (SER). Since the formulated SRM problem constitutes a difference convex (DC)-type programming problem, we solve it by employing a successive convex approximation (SCA) method. With the SCA method, the nonconvex part of the SRM problem can be locally linearized to its first-order Taylor expansion. Then, relying on solving a series of convexified optimization problems, an iterative precoding algorithm is developed. Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. Results show that our algorithm can achieve a near-optimal performance with guaranteed convergence.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications

With the proposed multi-mode control strategy, the active power from the PV arrays can be continuously extracted by the interleaved boost converter during LVRT, whereas the maximum power point tracking operation can be quickly achieved after the grid fault clearance. In addition, the multi-channel boost converter with interleaved operation can increase power conversion efficiency while decreasing the input current ripple. On the other hand, the current amplitude limitation control of the three-phase inverter can provide maximum reactive power under rated current amplitude during the voltage sag period and output the demanded reactive/rated current ratio to meet different LVRT codes. A three-phase 5-kVA prototype PV converter is built and tested to verify the performance of the proposed multi-mode operation strategy and the LVRT capability.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2449777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7322317/07132743.pdf","startPage":"7524","endPage":"7533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2449777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PV Power System With Multi-Mode Operation and Low-Voltage Ride-Through Capability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132743/","displayDocTitle":"PV Power System With Multi-Mode Operation and Low-Voltage Ride-Through Capability","volume":"62","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587141","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7132743/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PV Power System With Multi-Mode Operation and Low-Voltage Ride-Through Capability","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2449777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094141S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7322317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"7322317","articleId":"7132743","onlineDate":"24 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7132748,"authors":[{"name":"Qingsong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7322317/7132748/xu-2449772-small.gif","p":["\n\nQingsong Xu (M'09) received the B.S. degree in mechatronics engineering (with honors) from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2002 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electromechanical engineering from the University of Macau, Macao, China, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He was a Visiting Scholar with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland, and the National University of Singapore, Singapore.

The 2-DTSMC strategy is established based on the output feedback only, which eliminates the use of a state observer and facilitates an easy realization. Theoretical analysis proves that the quasi-sliding mode is reached in finite time along with high accuracy of the output tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated through comparative investigations. Experimental results show that the 2-DTSMC strategy is superior to traditional discrete-time sliding-mode control (DSMC), second-order DSMC, and DTSMC algorithms in terms of motion tracking accuracy, which demonstrates the efficiency of the reported 2-DTSMC scheme with a second-order nonlinear sliding surface.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piezoelectric Nanopositioning Control Using Second-Order Discrete-Time Terminal Sliding-Mode Strategy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2449772","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7322317/07132748.pdf","startPage":"7738","endPage":"7748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2449772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Piezoelectric Nanopositioning Control Using Second-Order Discrete-Time Terminal Sliding-Mode Strategy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7132748/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587121","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006469","fundingName":"Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ci\u00eancias e da Tecnologia","grantNumber":"070/2012/A3 and 052/2014/A1"},{"fundingName":"Research Committee of the University of Macau","grantNumber":"MYRG083(Y1-L2)-FST12-XQS and MYRG078(Y1-L2)-FST13-XQS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piezoelectric Nanopositioning Control Using Second-Order Discrete-Time Terminal Sliding-Mode Strategy","sourcePdf":"tie-xu-2449772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095456S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7322317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7322317","articleId":"7132748","onlineDate":"24 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7132753,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Modares","affiliation":["University of Texas at Arlington Research Institute, Fort Worth, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7287875/7132753/modar-2441749-small.gif","p":["Hamidreza Modares received the B.S. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2004, the M.S. degree from the Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Iran, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA, in 2015.","He was a Senior Lecturer with the Shahrood University of Technology, from 2006 to 2009.

Hadoop performance however is significantly affected by the settings of the Hadoop configuration parameters. Unfortunately, manually tuning these parameters is very time-consuming, if at all practical. This paper proposes an approach, called RFHOC, to automatically tune the Hadoop configuration parameters for optimized performance for a given application running on a given cluster. RFHOC constructs two ensembles of performance models using a random-forest approach for the map and reduce stage respectively. Leveraging these models, RFHOC employs a genetic algorithm to automatically search the Hadoop configuration space. The evaluation of RFHOC using five typical Hadoop programs, each with five different input data sets, shows that it achieves a performance speedup by a factor of 2.11 \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n on average and up to 7.4 \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n over the recently proposed cost-based optimization (CBO) approach.

A novel magnetic full-adder (MFA) based on this architecture is proposed, with MTJs switched by spin-Hall-assisted spin-transfer torque (STT). Owing to the assistance of spin-Hall effect (SHE), MTJ switching time can significantly be reduced, and high operation frequency can be achieved. Moreover, the endurance of oxide barrier is largely enhanced as the requirement of lower write voltage. Using an industrial CMOS 28 nm design kit and a physics-based three-terminal spin-Hall-assisted STT-MTJ model, functionality and performance of the proposed MFA have been simulated and validated. A 1 ns STT current pulse assisted by 0.35 ns SHE current pulse is sufficient to switch the MTJ configuration. When compared with the previous MFAs based on STT-MTJ, the proposed MFA achieves 38% less operation time and 31% less power consumption to perform read and write operations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7305868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7305868/07132762.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2449554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2449554","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Frequency Low-Power Magnetic Full-Adder Based on Magnetic Tunnel Junction With Spin-Hall Assistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132762/","displayDocTitle":"High-Frequency Low-Power Magnetic Full-Adder Based on Magnetic Tunnel Junction With Spin-Hall Assistance","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7132762/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"15552708","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","externalId":"1401704","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ANR-DIPMEM"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Frequency Low-Power Magnetic Full-Adder Based on Magnetic Tunnel Junction With Spin-Hall Assistance","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhao-2449554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088136S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7305868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7305868","articleId":"7132762","onlineDate":"24 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7132765,"authors":[{"name":"Bo H.

Free positioning of a plane receiving (Rx) coil is obtained for an arbitrary direction within 1m from a plane transmission (Tx) coil. Both the Tx and Rx coils consists of crossed dipole coils with an orthogonal phase difference; hence, a rotating magnetic field is generated from the Tx, which enables the Rx to receive power vertically or horizontally. Thus, the 3-D omnidirectional IPT is first realized for both the plate type Tx and Rx coils, which is crucial for practical applications, where volumetric coil structure is highly prohibited. This optimized configuration of coils has been obtained through a general classification of power transfer and searching for mathematical constraints on multi-D omnidirectional IPT. Conventional loop coils are thoroughly analyzed, and verified to be inadequate for the plate-type omnidirectional IPT in this paper.

The main objective is to achieve a precise and fully independent dimming and CCT control of the light mixture emitted from a two-string LED lamp comprising warm-white and cool-white color LEDs, regardless of the operating conditions and throughout the long operating lifetime of the LED lamp. The proposed control method is formulated using the nonlinear empirical LED model of the bicolor white LED system. Experimental results show that with the proposed closed-loop nonlinear approach, both CCT and dimming control of the bicolor lamp is significantly more accurate and robust to ambient temperature variations, ambient light interference, and LED aging than the conventional linear approach used in existing products. The maximum error in luminous flux employing the proposed closed-loop nonlinear approach is 3%, compared with 20% using the closed-loop linear approach. The maximum deviation in CCT is only 1.78%, compared with 27.5% with its linear counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2448641","startPage":"65","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7272758/07132772.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2448641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precise Dimming and Color Control of LED Systems Based on Color Mixing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Temperature measurement","LED lamps","Accuracy","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","colour","LED lamps","lighting control","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precise dimming control","color control","LED systems","color mixing","closed loop nonlinear scheme","luminosity control","correlated color temperature","bicolor adjustable light emitting diode lamp","nonlinear empirical LED model","bicolor white LED system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bi-color LED lamp","closed-loop nonlinear control","correlated color temperature (CCT)","dimming","light-emitting diode (LED)","light control"]},{"kwd":["Bicolor light-emitting diode (LED) lamp","closed-loop nonlinear approach","correlated color temperature (CCT)","dimming","light control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Precise Dimming and Color Control of LED Systems Based on Color Mixing","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7132772/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15474947","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grant Council","grantNumber":"T22-715/12N"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise Dimming and Color Control of LED Systems Based on Color Mixing","sourcePdf":"tpel-lee-2448641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08961S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7272758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7272758","articleId":"7132772","onlineDate":"24 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7132775,"authors":[{"name":"Abner Ramirez","affiliation":["CINVESTAV-Guadalajara, Mexico"],"firstName":"Abner","lastName":"Ramirez","id":"37275842700"},{"name":"Reza Iravani","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Iravani","id":"37275863000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"7132775","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Switches","Power transmission lines","PSCAD","MATLAB","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMTP","frequency-domain analysis","power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain simulation","electromagnetic transients","variable sampling time-step","EMT","discrete switching events","electric power network","single transmission line"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency-domain analysis","transient analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132775","abstract":"This letter presents the extension of a previously proposed frequency-domain (FD) approach for the analysis of electromagnetic transients (EMTs), primarily due to a set of discrete switching events, in an electric power network.

A centralized RAN enables advanced interference coordination strategies while leveraging the elastic provisioning of data processing resources. It is particularly well suited for dense deployments, such as within a large building where the RAPs are connected via fiber and where many cells are underutilized. This paper considers the computational requirements of a centralized RAN with the goal of illuminating the benefits of pooling computational resources. A new analytical framework is proposed for quantifying the computational load associated with the centralized processing of uplink signals in the presence of block Rayleigh fading, a distance-dependent path loss, and fractional power control. Several new performance metrics are defined, including the computational outage probability, the outage complexity, the computational gain, the computational diversity, and the complexity-rate tradeoff. The validity of the analytical framework is confirmed by numerically comparing it with a simulator compliant with the 3GPP LTE standard. Using the developed metrics, it is shown that centralizing computing resources provides a higher net throughput per computational resource as compared with local processing.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2449321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7321101/07132776.pdf","startPage":"6164","endPage":"6176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2449321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Complexity\u2013Rate Tradeoff of Centralized Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132776/","displayDocTitle":"The Complexity\u2013Rate Tradeoff of Centralized Radio Access Networks","volume":"14","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583854","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7132776/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)","grantNumber":"317941"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Complexity\u2013Rate Tradeoff of Centralized Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-rost-2449321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072766S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7321101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7321101","articleId":"7132776","onlineDate":"24 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7132781,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/7448491/7132781/liu-2449314-small.gif","p":["Xiao Liu received the BSc degree from Central South University in\n 2014.

However, each entity receives payoffs when providing services, which leads to competition between SOs and service entities or within internal service entities. In this paper, we first formulate the price competition model of SOs where the SOs dynamically increase and decrease their service prices periodically according to the number of collected services from entities. A game based services price decision (GSPD) model which depicts the process of price decisions is proposed in this paper. In the GSPD model, entities game with other entities under the rule of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d and calculate payoffs according to their own payoff-matrix, which leads to a Pareto-optimal equilibrium point. Numerous experiments demonstrate that the GSPD model can explain the price dynamics in the real world, and also can help decision makers a lot under various scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2016","volume":"9","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15917936","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7132781/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Service Pricing Decision in Cyber-Physical Systems: Insights from Game Theory","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB046305"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000646","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"26730056 and 15K15976"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000646","fundingName":"JSPS A3 Foresight Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379110, 61272149 and 61272494"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University","grantNumber":"2015zzts215"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Pricing Decision in Cyber-Physical Systems: Insights from Game Theory","sourcePdf":"tsc-liu-2449314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100583S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7448491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7448491","articleId":"7132781","onlineDate":"24 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7132788,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Lei","affiliation":["Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7321101/7132788/lei-2449295-small.gif","p":["\n\nLei Lei received the B.Eng. degree in electronic information engineering and M.Eng. degree in weapon systems and utilization engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, we study the problem of performing cell clustering and setting the activation time of each cluster, with the objective of minimizing the sum energy, subject to a time constraint of serving the users' traffic demand. Our optimization framework accounts for inter-cell interference, and, thus, the users' achievable rates depend on cluster formation. We provide mathematical formulations and analysis, and prove the problem's NP hardness. For problem solution, we first apply an optimization method that successively augments the set of variables under consideration, with the capability of approaching global optimum. Then, we derive a second solution algorithm to deal with the trade-off between optimality and the combinatorial nature of cluster formation. Numerical results demonstrate that our solutions achieve more than 40% energy saving over existing schemes, and that the solutions we obtain are within a few percent of deviation from global optimum.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7321101/07132788.pdf","startPage":"6150","endPage":"6163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions

In this PA, output voltage waveform of the PA is shaped as a half-sinusoidal voltage waveform peaked by a second harmonic. The knee voltage effect is minimized in this voltage waveform due to the large fundamental voltage for a given supply voltage, which is very important for an ET PA with a low average supply voltage. Based on the saturated PA, the ET PA is tested at 1.85 GHz using a long term evolution signal.

In fact settling accuracy and noise exhibit different time dependence, which can be exploited to optimize the overall performance. Settling accuracy is determined by average bandwidth in the whole amplification phase, whereas the output noise of interest is determined by the bandwidth near the end of the phase. The proposed amplifier divides the amplification phase into two sub-phases. The first sub-phase starts with high bandwidth and high slew rate to approach the final value quickly. In the second sub-phase, the bandwidth can be significantly reduced, achieving the target settling accuracy but with much lower noise. This division allows the settling accuracy, noise, slew rate, and DC gain to be designed independently. A test chip is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and operates at 90 MS/s. Measurements demonstrate that the proposed amplifier achieves 45% noise power reduction in the amplification phase along with improved linearity and lower power consumption, when compared with the conventional amplifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7132826/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15252223","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise Reduction Technique Through Bandwidth Switching for Switched-Capacitor Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Reduction Technique Through Bandwidth Switching for Switched-Capacitor Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhu-2446540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067932S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7132651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7132651","articleId":"7132826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7132854,"authors":[{"name":"Minfan Fu","affiliation":["University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Minfan","lastName":"Fu","id":"37070902600"},{"name":"Zefan Tang","affiliation":["University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Zefan Tang","id":"37087684789"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085453972"},{"name":"Chengbin Ma","affiliation":["University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, China"],"firstName":"Chengbin","lastName":"Ma","id":"38007944000"},{"name":"Xinen Zhu","affiliation":["University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37536990600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6610-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7132854","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1014},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132854","abstract":"It is attractive to achieve wireless power transfer with large spatial freedom by using a Megahertz system. For most systems, especially those working at kHz, the rectifiers are equivalently modelled as pure resistive loads when designing the compensated capacitors for coupling coils. However, the input reactance occurs when a rectifier works at high frequency, such as Megahertz. It can disturb the original circuit resonance designed without considering this reactance. This paper analyzes the input reactance for the full-bridge rectifier and evaluates its effects on the originally resonant coupling coils. A novel compensation method is proposed to eliminate the input reactance effects. Finally, a 6.78 MHz system is implemented in experiment. It shows that the compensation method can improve the system efficiency from 65% to 84% for the best case.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Couplings","Impedance","Wireless communication","Integrated circuit modeling","Capacitors","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","electric reactance","radiofrequency power transmission","rectifying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full bridge rectifier input reactance compensation","megahertz wireless power transfer systems","compensated capacitor","resonant coupling coils","compensation method","input reactance effect","frequency 6.78 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless power transfer","full-bridge rectifier","compensation","input reactance","impedance matching"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7132798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WoW.2015.7132854","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE PELS Workshop on Emerging Technologies: Wireless Power (2015 WoW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE PELS Workshop on Emerging Technologies: Wireless Power (2015 WoW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7127333/7132798/07132854.pdf","doi":"10.1109/WoW.2015.7132854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-bridge rectifier input reactance compensation in Megahertz wireless power transfer systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Full-bridge rectifier input reactance compensation in Megahertz wireless power transfer systems","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15240978","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-6 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7132854/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-bridge rectifier input reactance compensation in Megahertz wireless power transfer systems","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057519S","chronDate":"5-6 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7127333","isNumber":"7132798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7127333","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7132798","articleId":"7132854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7132891,"authors":[{"name":"Danda B.

Multiple networks were designed to determine how well a network could adapt to signals from different subjects. This was achieved by developing multiple networks with different combinations of the volunteers for training. Each network was tested with signals from all volunteers to determine how well they could adapt to new subjects. It was found that ANNs trained using only one or two subjects would perform exceptionally well when tested with signals from the same subjects but relatively poorly when tested with signals from new subjects. As the number of subjects used for training increased, the ability of the network to accurately classify the signals from the trainees decreased but their ability to adapt to signals from new subjects increased. Solely based on these results, it can be inferred that ANNs developed using signals from a large amount of subjects could be used to accurately classify signals from completely new subjects. Research presented in this paper has potential to be further developed as a basis for utilizing sEMG as control signals in electric devices such as myoelectric prosthesis or humanoid control.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2015.7132893","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2015.7132893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7132866","displayPublicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124301/7132866/07132893.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A case study on tuning artificial neural networks to recognize signal patterns of hand motions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132893/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A case study on tuning artificial neural networks to recognize signal patterns of hand motions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7132893/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15240512","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"9-12 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A case study on tuning artificial neural networks to recognize signal patterns of hand motions","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077367S","chronDate":"9-12 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124301","isNumber":"7132866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124301","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7132866","articleId":"7132893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7132946,"authors":[{"name":"Khondokar M.F.

Due to the dynamic nature of the protocol, the network has self-healing ability. The software library developed in the course of this implementation provides the user an interface to implement customized multi-hopping on XBee Series1 due to absence of any underlying operating system.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2015.7132965","publicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","displayPublicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124301/7132866/07132965.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2015.7132965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7132866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Dynamic Source Routing using 802.15.4 on XBee Series 1 Modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Dynamic Source Routing using 802.15.4 on XBee Series 1 Modules","xploreNote":"As originally published there is an error in this document.

Energy savings may be achieved at the cost of reduced accuracy for signal processing applications whereby constituent adder and multiplier circuits need not generate a precise output. Since the performance versus energy savings landscape is complex, we investigate the acceleration of the design of approximate adders using parallelized Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The fitness evaluation of each approximate adder is explored by the GA in a non-sequential fashion to automatically generate novel approximate designs within specified performance thresholds. This paper advances methods of parallelizing GAs and implements a new parallel GA approach for approximate multi-bit adder design. A speedup of approximately 1.6-fold is achieved using a quad-core Intel processor and results indicate that the proposed GA is able to find adders which consume 63:8% less energy than accurate adders.","displayPublicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124301/7132866/07132970.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2015.7132970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2015.7132970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7132866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7132970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing energy-efficient approximate adders using parallel genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Genetic algorithms","Approximation methods","Sociology","Statistics","Mathematical model","Mirrors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient approximate adders","parallel genetic algorithms","energy savings","signal processing applications","adder circuits","multiplier circuits","approximate designs","specified performance thresholds","parallel GA approach","multibit adder design","quad-core Intel processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallelism","genetic algorithms","parallel genetic algorithm","inexact arithmetic units","approximate computing","adder","variable accuracy","low power","adders","error distance","power consumption","process variation","delay","power reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7132970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Designing energy-efficient approximate adders using parallel genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7132970/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240596","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"9-12 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing energy-efficient approximate adders using parallel genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068747S","chronDate":"9-12 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124301","isNumber":"7132866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124301","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7132866","articleId":"7132970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7132978,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy J.

UAV ad hoc networks have the potential to provide reliable and real-time services using single-hop or multi-hop communications. However, the network topology of a UAV ad-hoc network is highly dynamic because of the fast flying UAVs that result in short lived communication links between UAVs. In mission critical applications, small delays could result in catastrophic outcomes. Thus it is required for UAVs to exchange their information as quickly as possible (with shortest possible delay). In this paper, we evaluate the performance of UAV ad hoc networks by considering the effect of network size on throughput, energy consumption and effective transmission range (total coverage range). Numerical results obtained from simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of UAV ad hoc networks. Our results show that when network size (the number of UAVs) increases, the throughput per UAV and energy consumption decrease while the total network transmission range (effective coverage range) increases.","displayPublicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124301/7132866/07133020.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2015.7133020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2015.7133020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7132866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ad hoc networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Throughput","Routing protocols","Energy consumption","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","energy consumption","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV ad hoc networks","network size effect","network throughput","energy consumption","effective transmission range","total network transmission range"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV ad hoc networks","aerial MANETs","wireless ad hoc networks","performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133020/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240577","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"9-12 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049721S","chronDate":"9-12 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124301","isNumber":"7132866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124301","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7132866","articleId":"7133020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7133027,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Bupe","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Information Technology, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, United States"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Bupe","id":"37085508688"},{"name":"Rami Haddad","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Information Technology, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, United States"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Haddad","id":"37677215100"},{"name":"Fernando Rios-Gutierrez","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Information Technology, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, United States"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Rios-Gutierrez","id":"38276182700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7300-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-058X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-0050"}],"articleNumber":"7133027","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1344},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Global Positioning System","Protocols","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Standards","Clustering algorithms","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","cellular radio","decentralised control","emergency management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relief and emergency communication network","autonomous decentralized UAV clustering network","Hurricane Katrina","United States","land-line phones disconnections","unmanned aerial vehicles","disaster recovery communication network","automation algorithm","cell network structure","7-cell clusters","hexagonal pattern","MAVLink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Emergency services","Telecommunication network","Global Positioning System","Telemetry"]}],"abstract":"The recent years have witnessed an increase in the natural disasters in which the destruction of the essential communication infrastructure has significantly affected the number of casualties. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina in the United States resulted in over 1,900 deaths, 3 million land-line phones disconnections, and more than 2,000 cell sites going out of service. This incident highlighted an urgent need for a quick-deployment efficient communication network for relief purposes. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous system to deploy Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) as the first phase disaster recovery communication network for wide-area relief. An automation algorithm has been developed to control the deployment and positioning of UAVs based on a traditional cell network structure utilizing 7-cell clusters in a hexagonal pattern using MAVLink. The distributed execution of the algorithm is based on a centralized management of UAV cells through assigning higher ranked UAVs referred to as supernodes. The algorithm autonomously elects supernodes based on weighted variables and dynamically handles any changes in total number of UAVs in the system. This system represents a novel approach for handling a large-scale autonomous deployment of a UAV communications network. The proposed autonomous communication network was verified and validated using software simulation and physical demonstration using identical quadrotor UAVs.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2015.7133027","publicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","displayPublicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124301/7132866/07133027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2015.7133027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7132866","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relief and emergency communication network based on an autonomous decentralized UAV clustering network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Relief and emergency communication network based on an autonomous decentralized UAV clustering network","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133027/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240556","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7133027/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relief and emergency communication network based on an autonomous decentralized UAV clustering network","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043818S","chronDate":"9-12 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124301","isNumber":"7132866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124301","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7132866","articleId":"7133027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133044,"authors":[{"name":"Adel El Shahat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, Georgia"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"El Shahat","id":"37085538965"},{"name":"Rami J.

This paper proposes a novel method for wind energy estimation in the state of Georgia. This method is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using real data obtained from several weather station sites around the state. The proposed ANN model was trained and then tested using a local station located in Savannah. The ANN inputs are elevation, latitude, longitude, day, temperatures (min/max), and the output is the daily wind speed. The model was efficiently implemented in Simulink environment using closed-form algebraic equations which eliminated the need for repeated training. The ANN model was formulated with suitable numbers of layers/neurons which was trained and tested with excellent regression constant. Furthermore, the ANN model has the ability to interpolate between learning curves to generate wind speed estimates for different locations. It is anticipated that this model will be able to successfully select sites for wind turbine installations for residential applications in the state of Georgia.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2015.7133044","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","displayPublicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124301/7132866/07133044.pdf","publicationTitle":"SoutheastCon 2015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2015.7133044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7132866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An artificial Neural Network model for wind energy estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind speed","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Data models","Biological neural networks","Wind energy generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity","neural nets","power engineering computing","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network model","wind energy estimation","wind energy resources","distributed generation systems","electricity","residential use","weather station sites","ANN model","daily wind speed","Simulink environment","closed form algebraic equations","wind speed estimates","wind turbine installations","residential applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wind Energy","Neural Network","Estimation","Wind Prediction","Renewable"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"An artificial Neural Network model for wind energy estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133044/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"9-12 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240506","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An artificial Neural Network model for wind energy estimation","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"83.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027214S","chronDate":"9-12 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124301","isNumber":"7132866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124301","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7132866","articleId":"7133044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7133080,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Peng Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD"],"firstName":"Yi-Peng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085458576"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5526-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5524-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133080","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"abstract":"Information-theoretic work for wiretap channels is mostly based on random coding schemes.

They have received considerable attention in recent years due to their applications in distributed storage. Most existing results on LRCs do not explicitly take into consideration the field size q, i.e., the size of the code alphabet. In particular, for the binary case, only a few specific results are known by Goparaju and Calderbank. Recently, however, an upper bound on the dimension k of LRCs was presented by Cadambe and Mazumdar. The bound takes into account the length n, minimum distance d, locality r, and field size q, and it is applicable to both non-linear and linear codes. In this work, we first develop an improved version of the bound mentioned above for linear codes. We then focus on cyclic linear binary codes. By leveraging the cyclic structure, we notice that the locality of such a code is determined by the minimum distance of its dual code. Using this result, we investigate the locality of a variety of well known cyclic linear binary codes, e.g., Hamming codes and Simplex codes, and also prove their optimality with our improved bound for linear codes. We also discuss the locality of codes which are obtained by applying the operations of Extend, Shorten, Expurgate, Augment, and Lengthen to cyclic linear binary codes.

The analysis considers the scaling behavior of capacity and achievable rates by letting both the number of antennas and the bandwidth go to infinity jointly. In contrast to prior work on wideband single input single output (SISO) channels without a-priori channel state information, it is shown that a sufficiently large number of receive antennas can make up for the vanishingly small SNR at each antenna. In particular, it is shown that when bandwidth grows sufficiently slowly with the number of antennas, the capacity scaling with an increasing number of receive antennas is the same as the optimal coherent capacity scaling. If the bandwidth grows faster than a certain threshold, however, the additional bandwidth does not help because a finite transmit power is spread over an excessively large bandwidth.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2015.7133138","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7123792/7133075/07133138.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2015.7133138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity scaling in noncoherent wideband massive SIMO systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Capacity scaling in noncoherent wideband massive SIMO systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7133138/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240372","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133138/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity scaling in noncoherent wideband massive SIMO systems","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"1570059771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093319S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7123792","isNumber":"7133075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7123792","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7133075","articleId":"7133138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7133139,"authors":[{"name":"Ronit Bustin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University"],"firstName":"Ronit","lastName":"Bustin","id":"37546631400"},{"name":"Rafael F.

Specifically, the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) behavior of these codes is explored as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is first shown that reliable decoding of the codeword at the legitimate receiver and at the eavesdropper, conditioned on the transmitted message, is a necessary and sufficient condition for an optimally secure code sequence. Moreover, it is observed that a stochastic encoder is required for any code sequence with rate below the channel point-to-point capacity. Then, for code sequences attaining the maximum level of equivocation, it is shown that their codebook sequences must resemble \u201cgood\u201d point-to-point, capacity achieving, code sequences. Finally, it is shown that the mapping over such \u201cgood\u201d codebook sequences that produces a maximum equivocation code must saturate the eavesdropper.

For such network, quantize-map-and-forward (QMF) (or noisy network coding (NNC)) can achieve the cut-set upper bound within a constant gap where the gap grows linearly with the number of relay stages K. However, this gap may not be negligible for the systems with multihop transmissions (e.g., a power-limited wireless backhaul system operating at high frequencies). In this paper, we obtain an improved result to the capacity scaling where the gap grows logarithmically as log (K). This is achieved by using an optimal quantization at relays and by exploiting relays' messages (decoded in the previous time slot) as side-information at the destination. We further improve the performance of this network by presenting a mixed strategy where each relay can perform either decode-and-forward (DF) or QMF with possibly rate-splitting.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2015.7133148","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7123792/7133075/07133148.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2015.7133148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop virtual full-duplex relay channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133148/","displayDocTitle":"Multihop virtual full-duplex relay channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240360","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133148/","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop virtual full-duplex relay channels","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"1570071875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069974S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7123792","isNumber":"7133075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7123792","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7133075","articleId":"7133148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133150,"authors":[{"name":"Eirik Rosnes","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, The Simula Research Lab, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Eirik","lastName":"Rosnes","id":"37272234600"},{"name":"Michael Helmling","affiliation":["Mathematical Institute, University of Koblenz-Landau, Koblenz, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Helmling","id":"37888189000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5526-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5524-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133150","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Linear codes","Iterative decoding","Indexes","Linear programming","Binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","decoding","linear codes","linear programming","parity check codes","ternary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive linear programming decoding","ternary linear codes","finite field","codeword polytope","binary image","Flanagan embedding","ternary single parity-check code","adaptive LP decoder","static LP decoder","check node degree","block length","nonbinary codes"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we consider adaptive linear programming (LP) decoding of ternary linear codes, i. e., linear codes over the finite field F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</sub>\n with q = 3 elements.

By relaxing these factorable coding constraints to linear constraints, it is straightforward to form a decoding optimization problem. Furthermore, by pairing these factor graphs with the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) technique of large-scale optimization, one can develop distributed algorithms to solve the decoding optimization problems. However, the non-trivial part has always been developing an efficient algorithm for the subroutines of ADMM, which directly relates to the geometries of the relaxed coding constraints. In this paper, we focus on summarizing existing results and distilling insights to these problems. First, we review the ADMM formulation and geometries involved in the subroutines.

When pages, which are the smallest write unit, are updated, they are written in a new copy rather than in place. As a result, every page can have more than one copy in the memory, its current version as well as some of its old invalid copies. Each invalid copy can be cleaned only when the block in which it resides is erased (blocks are the smallest erase unit and are typically in the order of hundreds of pages). This write property introduces redundancy in the memory, given by the invalid copies of the pages, and as a result can also affect the memory lifetime. In this paper we show how this inherent redundancy of invalid pages can be taken advantage of for the purpose of improving RAID solutions which are based upon Solid State Drives (SSDs). Our main contribution in the paper is a construction which shows how to improve the repair bandwidth of codes which are implemented on SSDs. We first show that with a single parity it is possible to transmit on the average roughly half of the data for rebuilding a single drive failure. We then show how these ideas can be extended for Zigzag codes with two parities and again improve their repair bandwidth.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7123792/7133075/07133159.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2015.7133159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2015.7133159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Codes for RAID solutions based upon SSDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Codes for RAID solutions based upon SSDs","htmlLink":"/document/7133159/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15240421","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Codes for RAID solutions based upon SSDs","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"1570075819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098332S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7123792","isNumber":"7133075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7123792","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7133075","articleId":"7133159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133162,"authors":[{"name":"Victoria Kostina","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"],"firstName":"Victoria","lastName":"Kostina","id":"37391022000"},{"name":"Yury Polyanskiy","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"],"firstName":"Yury","lastName":"Polyanskiy","id":"37392823000"},{"name":"Sergio Verd\u00fa","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Verd\u00fa","id":"37274351500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5526-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5524-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133162","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","AWGN channels","Blogs","Random variables","Decoding","Encoding","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","combined source-channel coding","memoryless systems","rate distortion theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["k sample transmission","memoryless Gaussian channel","transmitted energy reduction","noiseless feedback","nonvanishing excess distortion probability","asymptotic fundamental limit","finite average energy","joint source-channel coding","lossy compression","rate-distortion theory","finite-blocklength regime","single-shot method","energy-distortion tradeoff","AWGN channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint source-channel coding","lossy compression","single-shot method","finite-blocklength regime","rate-distortion theory","feedback","memoryless channels","Gaussian channels","energy-distortion tradeoff","Shannon theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133162","abstract":"We investigate the minimum transmitted energy required to reproduce k source samples with a given fidelity after transmission over a memoryless Gaussian channel.

However, magnetic recording channels are generally modeled as binary-input intersymbol interference (ISI) channels, and the design of polar coding schemes for these channels remains an important open problem. Current magnetic hard disk drives use LDPC codes incorporated into a turbo-equalization (TE) architecture that combines a soft-output channel detector with a soft-input, soft-output sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoder. An interleaved coding scheme with a multistage decoding (MSD) architecture with LDPC codes as component codes has been proposed as an alternative to TE for ISI channels. In this work, we investigate the use of polar codes as component codes in the TE and MSD architectures. It is shown that the achievable rate of the MSD scheme converges to the symmetric information rate of the ISI channel when the number of interleaves is large. Simulations results comparing the performance of LDPC codes and polar codes in TE and MSD architectures are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Encoding","Parity check codes","Memoryless systems","Bit error rate","Magnetic recording","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","interleaved codes","intersymbol interference","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar codes","magnetic recording channels","binary memoryless symmetric channels","decoding algorithms","code modifications","LDPC codes","binary-input intersymbol interference channels","turbo-equalization architecture","soft-input soft-output sum-product algorithm decoder","interleaved coding scheme","multistage decoding architecture","MSD architectures","TE","ISI channels"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133166","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2015.7133166","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7123792/7133075/07133166.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2015.7133166","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133075","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar codes for magnetic recording channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polar codes for magnetic recording channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133166/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133166/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240386","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar codes for magnetic recording channels","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"1570079265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062333S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7123792","isNumber":"7133075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7123792","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7133075","articleId":"7133166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7133169,"authors":[{"name":"Naftali Tishby","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Naftali","lastName":"Tishby","id":"37621660200"},{"name":"Noga Zaslavsky","affiliation":["The Edmond and Lilly Safra Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Noga","lastName":"Zaslavsky","id":"37085462340"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5526-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5524-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133169","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":202,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5366},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","Complexity theory","Mutual information","Bifurcation","Computer architecture","Feature extraction","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bifurcation","data compression","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information bottleneck principle","deep neural networks","DNN","IB principle","mutual information","output variables","optimal information theoretic limits","finite sample generalization bounds","optimal architecture","layer connections","bifurcation points","input layer compression","output layer","hierarchical layered network representations","structural phase transitions","information curve","optimality bounds","deep learning algorithms","layer features"]}],"abstract":"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via the theoretical framework of the information bottleneck (IB) principle. We first show that any DNN can be quantified by the mutual information between the layers and the input and output variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal information theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization bounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity. We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along the information curve.

A particularly studied setting is the shared link caching network, in which a single source with access to a file library communicates with multiple users, each having the capability to store segments (packets) of the library files, over a shared multicast link. Each user requests one file from the library according to a common demand distribution and the server sends a coded multicast message to satisfy all users at once. The problem consists of finding the smallest possible average codeword length to satisfy such requests. In this paper, we consider the generalization to the case where each user places L \u2265 1 independent requests according to the same common demand distribution. We propose an achievable scheme based on random vector (packetized) caching placement and multiple groupcast index coding, shown to be order-optimal in the asymptotic regime in which the number of packets per file B goes to infinity. We then show that the scalar (B = 1) version of the proposed scheme can still preserve order-optimality when the number of per-user requests L is large enough. Our results provide the first order-optimal characterization of the shared link caching network with multiple random requests, revealing the key effects of L on the performance of caching-aided coded multicast schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133172/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15240420","publicationDate":"April 2015","conferenceDate":"26 April-1 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133172/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Caching-aided coded multicasting with multiple random requests","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching-aided coded multicasting with multiple random requests","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"1570114117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065193S","chronDate":"April 26 2015-May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7123792","isNumber":"7133075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7123792","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7133075","articleId":"7133172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7133516,"authors":[{"name":"Michael V\u00f6gler","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"V\u00f6gler","id":"37070370500"},{"name":"Johannes Schleicher","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Schleicher","id":"37085338313"},{"name":"Christian Inzinger","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Inzinger","id":"38229519800"},{"name":"Stefan Nastic","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Nastic","id":"38529171600"},{"name":"Sanjin Sehic","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Sanjin","lastName":"Sehic","id":"37601295000"},{"name":"Schahram Dustdar","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Schahram","lastName":"Dustdar","id":"37085372742"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8356-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133516","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":601},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133516","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Software","Buildings","Protocols","Containers","Cities and towns","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","Internet of Things","resource allocation","service-oriented architecture","smart cities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LEONORE","large-scale provisioning of resource-constrained IoT deployments","IoT devices","embedded execution environments","custom application logic","storage capabilities","structured approach","heterogeneous devices","large-scale IoT systems","smart city domain","service oriented infrastructure","heterogeneous edge devices","large-scale IoT deployments","pull-based deployments"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SOSE.2015.23","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7126273/7133490/07133516.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOSE.2015.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LEONORE -- Large-Scale Provisioning of Resource-Constrained IoT Deployments","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) devices are usually considered as external dependencies that only provide data, or process and execute simple instructions. Recently, IoT devices with embedded execution environments emerged that allow practitioners to deploy and execute custom application logic on the device. This approach fundamentally changes the overall process of designing, developing, deploying and managing IoT systems. However, these devices exhibit significant differences in available execution environments, processing, and storage capabilities. To accommodate this diversity, a structured approach is needed to uniformly and transparently deploy application components onto a large number of heterogeneous devices. This is especially important in the context of current large-scale IoT systems, such as in the smart city domain. In this paper, we present LEONORE, a service oriented infrastructure that provides elastic provisioning of application components on resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge devices in large-scale IoT deployments. LEONORE supports push-based as well as pull-based deployments and we show that our solution is able to elastically provision large numbers of devices using a testbed based on a real-world industry scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133516/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15252304","publicationDate":"March 2015","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133516/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"LEONORE -- Large-Scale Provisioning of Resource-Constrained IoT Deployments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LEONORE -- Large-Scale Provisioning of Resource-Constrained IoT Deployments","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8356a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077988S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126273","isNumber":"7133490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126273","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7133490","articleId":"7133516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133531,"authors":[{"name":"Yanchen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yanchen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085363316"},{"name":"Myung J.

To better utilize the computing resource of the cloud server, a novel resource allocation algorithm is proposed in this paper with the consideration of application partition offloading sequence while maintaining the high quality of service (QoS) of mobile users. The resource allocation problem is modeled as a semi-Markov decision process. Through maximizing the long-term discounted system reward, an optimal resource allocation policy is calculated for partitioned mobile applications using policy iteration approach, which makes a latter partition of the application more easily to obtain resource to speed up the application execution. Both theoretical and simulation results show that the system can adaptively adjust the allocation policy of whether to utilize the cloud and how much computing resource to allocate, according to the request traffic of mobile applications, the partition's position in the application, and the availability of system resources. The proposed algorithm outperforms Greedy admission control in terms of system throughput and QoS over a broad range of environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Resource Allocation Algorithm for Partitioned Services in Mobile Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering","doi":"10.1109/SOSE.2015.19","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7126273/7133490/07133531.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOSE.2015.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Resource Allocation Algorithm for Partitioned Services in Mobile Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"30 March-3 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133531/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15252312","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Resource Allocation Algorithm for Partitioned Services in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8356a209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084454S","chronDate":"March 30 2015-April 3 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126273","isNumber":"7133490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126273","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7133490","articleId":"7133531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133545,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Cheng","affiliation":["School of Computer, Northwest Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085358479"},{"name":"Yian Zhu","affiliation":["School of Computer, Northwest Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yian","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37676855800"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37417706200"},{"name":"Chuanxi Zhu","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Northwest Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chuanxi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085587267"},{"name":"Wenqiang Zhou","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Northwest Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wenqiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085591350"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8356-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133545","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133545","abstract":"Mobile compatibility testing has been identified as one urgent and challenging issue.

Therefore, the minimization of energy consumption and energy harvesting technology are key tools for maximization of network lifetime and achieving self sustainability in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This paper proposes an energy aware Adaptive Sampling Algorithm (ASA) for WSN with power hungry sensors and harvesting capabilities. An existing ASA developed for wireless sensor networks with power hungry sensors is optimized and enhanced to adapt the sampling frequency according to the available energy of the node. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using an in-field testbed with a sensor node which incorporates a wind harvester and a power hungry wind speed/direction sensor. Simulation and comparison between an existing ASA and the energy aware ASA in terms of energy durability are carried out using the measured wind energy and the wind speed over a period of a month. The simulation results have shown that using ASA in combination with energy aware function on the nodes can drastically increase the lifetime of a WSN node. Moreover, the energy aware ASA in conjunction with the node energy harvesting capability can lead towards a perpetual operation of WSN and significantly outperform state-of-the-art ASA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Batteries","Mathematical model","Energy harvesting","Wind turbines","Wind speed","Energy states"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy aware adaptive sampling algorithm","energy harvesting","wireless sensor networks","sensor node"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive sampling","Energy harvesting","energy management","power hungry sensors","wind harvesting","WSN"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SAS.2015.7133582","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122653/7133559/07133582.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS.2015.7133582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy aware adaptive sampling algorithm for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy aware adaptive sampling algorithm for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133582/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133582/","accessionNumber":"15240325","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy aware adaptive sampling algorithm for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1570055713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065409S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122653","isNumber":"7133559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122653","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7133559","articleId":"7133582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7133611,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Balsamo","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Balsamo","id":"37400516800"},{"name":"Gianluca Gallo","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Gallo","id":"37085435716"},{"name":"Davide Brunelli","affiliation":["University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Brunelli","id":"37543052100"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Bologna, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6117-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133611","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":598},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Current measurement","Monitoring","Zigbee","Wireless communication","Home appliances","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","energy harvesting","power meters","wireless sensor networks","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart buildings","nonintrusive Zigbee power meter","nonintrusive load monitoring","nonintrusive wireless energy meter","energy harvesting","energy sustainability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Smart Metering","Energy Harvesting"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-intrusive Zigbee power meter for load monitoring in smart buildings","doi":"10.1109/SAS.2015.7133611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133559","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122653/7133559/07133611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS.2015.7133611","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133611","abstract":"Energy efficiency in smart buildings requires distributed sensing infrastructure to monitor the power consumption of appliances, machines and lighting sources. The analysis of current and voltage waveforms is fundamental for gathering diagnostic information about the power quality and for reducing power wastage. Moreover, it enables Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), which is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances, by analysing the voltage and current changes. In this paper, an innovative full Energy-neutral (i.e. battery free) and Non-intrusive Wireless Energy Meter (NIWEM) is presented to measure current, voltage and power factor. As key features, the NIWEM is completely non-invasive and it can self-sustain its operations by harvesting energy from the monitored load. It also features a standard (Zigbee) wireless interface for communication with the smart-building system. Experimental results have confirmed that complete energy sustainability can be achieved also with very low-power loads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15240311","htmlLink":"/document/7133611/","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Non-intrusive Zigbee power meter for load monitoring in smart buildings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-intrusive Zigbee power meter for load monitoring in smart buildings","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1570055995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064093S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122653","isNumber":"7133559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122653","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7133559","articleId":"7133611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133627,"authors":[{"name":"Andres Gomez","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Gomez","id":"37085451759"},{"name":"Marie Francine Lagadec","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marie Francine","lastName":"Lagadec","id":"37085461134"},{"name":"Michele Magno","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Magno","id":"37601742500"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37085360741"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6117-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133627","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Monitoring","Power demand","Data acquisition","Wireless communication","Energy storage","Low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","computerised monitoring","data acquisition","energy harvesting","hazardous areas","low-power electronics","microcontrollers","particle detectors","radiation monitoring","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-sustainable wireless sensor node","unmanned aerial vehicle","radioactivity monitoring","contaminated area","radiation monitoring","data log acquisition","off-the-shelf components","communication management","low-power nuclear radiation sensor","hazardous area","inaccessible area","power consumption efficiency","low-power microcontroller","nonvolatile memory","energy harvesting","adaptive power management","duty cycling","nano-watt wake-up radio","power 70 muW","power 50 muW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","energy management","energy neutral WSN","WSN","radiation monitoring"]}],"abstract":"A self-sustainable wireless sensor node for the monitoring radiation in contaminated and poorly accessible areas is presented. The node is designed to work in collaboration with an unmanned aerial vehicle used for two essential mission steps: air-deploying the wireless sensor nodes at suitable locations and acquiring data logs via ultra-low power, short-range radio communication in fly-by mode, after a wake-up routine. The system allows for the use of off-the-shelf components for defining mission, drop-zone and trajectory, for compressing data, and for communication management. The node is equipped with a low-power nuclear radiation sensor and it was designed and implemented with self-sustainability in mind as it will be deployed in hazardous, inaccessible areas. To this end, the proposed node uses a combination of complementary techniques: a low-power microcontroller with non-volatile memory, energy harvesting, adaptive power management and duty cycling, and a nano-watt wake-up radio. Experimental results show the power consumption efficiency of the solution, which achieves 70uW in sleep mode and 500uW in active mode. Finally, simulations based on actual field measurements confirm the solution's self-sustainability and illustrate the impact of different sampling rates and that of the wake-up radio.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-powered wireless sensor nodes for monitoring radioactivity in contaminated areas using unmanned aerial vehicles","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","doi":"10.1109/SAS.2015.7133627","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122653/7133559/07133627.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS.2015.7133627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Self-powered wireless sensor nodes for monitoring radioactivity in contaminated areas using unmanned aerial vehicles","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133627/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240280","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-powered wireless sensor nodes for monitoring radioactivity in contaminated areas using unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1570056153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08783S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122653","isNumber":"7133559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122653","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7133559","articleId":"7133627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133634,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Pugh","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Pugh","id":"38580844900"},{"name":"Jerry Brewer","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jerry","lastName":"Brewer","id":"38580580600"},{"name":"Jacques Kvam","affiliation":["Verdigris Technologies, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Kvam"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6117-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7133634","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Noise","Time series analysis","Frequency-domain analysis","Principal component analysis","Sensor fusion","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","infrared detectors","probability","safety systems","security of data","sensor fusion","signal detection","statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor fusion algorithm","intrusion detection","multiple passive infrared sensor","PIR sensor","false alarm probability constraint","background noise statistics","Mahalanobis distance","frequency domain analysis"]}],"abstract":"Sensor fusion algorithms allow the combination of many heterogeneous data types to make sophisticated decisions. In many situations, these algorithms give increased performance such as better detectability and/or reduced false alarm rates. To achieve these benefits, typically some system or signal model is given. This work focuses on the situation where the event signal is unknown and a false alarm criterion must be met. Specifically, the case where data from multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors are processed to detect intrusion into a room while satisfying a false alarm constraint is analyzed. The central challenge is the space of intrusion signals is unknown and we want to quantify analytically the probability of false alarm. It is shown that this quantification is possible by estimating the background noise statistics and computing the Mahalanobis distance in the frequency domain. Using the Mahalanobis distance as the decision metric, a threshold is computed to satisfy the false alarm constraint.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor fusion for intrusion detection under false alarm constraints","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","doi":"10.1109/SAS.2015.7133634","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122653/7133559/07133634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS.2015.7133634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sensor fusion for intrusion detection under false alarm constraints","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133634/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15240293","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor fusion for intrusion detection under false alarm constraints","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1570053625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064506S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122653","isNumber":"7133559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122653","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7133559","articleId":"7133634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133674,"authors":[{"name":"Iulian Danila","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Iulian","lastName":"Danila","id":"37085395486"},{"name":"Radu Dobrescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Dobrescu","id":"37297274100"},{"name":"Dan Popescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Popescu","id":"37340429200"},{"name":"Roxana Marcu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Roxana","lastName":"Marcu","id":"38548446300"},{"name":"Loretta Ichim","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Loretta","lastName":"Ichim","id":"37945536900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7514-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2068-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7133674","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Servers","Telecommunication standards","Logic gates","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","health care","Internet of Things","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M2M service platforms","device management","network-connected machines","M2M ecosystem","connection management platform","3GPP mobile networks","OMA lightweight M2M enabler","LWM2M","M2M communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["M2M","Internet of Things","mobile network","cloud computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133674","doi":"10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133661","publicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124303/7133661/07133674.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M2M service platforms and device management","abstract":"The main goal of network-connected machines is to improve the quality of lives in numerous ways: from speeding up traffic, reducing fuel consumption, saving lives, improving access to healthcare, down to making everyday life more convenient and interesting.

The nonlinearity of the ferromagnetic core is treated by the polarization fixed point method (PFPM), the magnetic polarization correction being performed iteratively in terms of the magnetic field intensity. A hybrid Finite Element Method (FEM) - Boundary Element Method (BEM) technique is employed in order to solve the electromagnetic field problem. The FEM is used for the computation of the field within the ferromagnetic bodies and, independently, the BEM is applied to the outside free space, the coupling between the FEM and BEM domains being performed by an iterative correction of the boundary conditions. The terminal voltages determine the coil magnetic fluxes and, then, the current density is obtained by integrating the vector potential over the coil cross sections. The variation with time of the terminal voltages is also taken into account in the solution of the coupled electro-mechanical problem. The response is determined for terminal voltages applied at various times within a period.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124303/7133661/07133845.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","doi":"10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a hybrid FEM-BEM method to the time response of an electromagnet under imposed terminal voltages","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element analysis","Magnetic fields","Magnetic forces","Electromagnets","Magnetic domains","Couplings","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-elements methods","coils","current density","electromagnetic coupling","electromagnetic fields","electromagnets","finite element analysis","iterative methods","magnetic cores","magnetic fields","magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid FEM-BEM method application","electromagnet time response","imposed terminal voltage","electromagnet armature motion analysis","ferromagnetic core nonlinearity","polarization fixed point method","PFPM","magnetic polarization correction","magnetic field intensity","hybrid finite element method-boundary element method technique","electromagnetic field","coil magnetic flux","current density","coupled electromechanical problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["iterative hybrid FEM-BEM techniques","nonlinear media","time response of an electromagnet armature"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Application of a hybrid FEM-BEM method to the time response of an electromagnet under imposed terminal voltages","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133845/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240906","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a hybrid FEM-BEM method to the time response of an electromagnet under imposed terminal voltages","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"EMGF264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079476S","chronDate":"7-9 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124303","isNumber":"7133661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124303","xplore-issue":"7133661","articleId":"7133845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133863,"authors":[{"name":"Lucian Petrescu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian","lastName":"Petrescu","id":"38237390700"},{"name":"Emil Cazacu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Cazacu","id":"37543273800"},{"name":"Catalina Petrescu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Catalina","lastName":"Petrescu","id":"37085372251"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7514-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2068-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7133863","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic hysteresis","Mathematical model","Logistics","Soft magnetic materials","Analytical models","Hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","magnetic hysteresis","magnetic leakage","magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sigmoid functions","hysteresis phenomenon modeling","magnetic materials","magnetic hysteresis","hysteresis losses","relative errors","loop area"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["magnetic hysteresis","sigmoid functions","hysteresis losses evaluation"]}],"abstract":"Hysteresis phenomenon is currently met in magnetic materials characterization.

In this work, active and reactive power consumption prediction model is developed and analysed for a typical Southern Norwegian house for hourly power (active and reactive) consumptions and time information as inputs. In the proposed model, a neural network is adopted as a main technique and historical domestic load data of around 2 years are used as input. The available data has some measurement errors and missing segments. Before using the data for training purpose, missing and inaccurate data are considered and then it is used for testing the model. It is observed that the possible reasons of prediction errors may be due to local external parameters (e.g. ambient temperature, moisture, solar radiation etc.). It may be required to include analysis of these external parameters on domestic demand prediction model with peak prediction and timing and this will be carried out in our further work.","doi":"10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133866","startPage":"535","endPage":"538","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124303/7133661/07133866.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domestic load forecasting using neural network and its use for missing data analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Reactive power","Data processing","Power demand","Load modeling","Data models","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","energy management systems","load forecasting","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domestic load forecasting","neural network","data analysis","domestic demand prediction","home energy management system","peak reduction","power system network","reactive power consumption prediction model","Southern Norwegian house","measurement errors","ambient temperature","moisture","solar radiation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domestic load","forecasting","home energy management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7133866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Domestic load forecasting using neural network and its use for missing data analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7133866/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2015","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15240840","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domestic load forecasting using neural network and its use for missing data analysis","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"MATHEE281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044821S","chronDate":"7-9 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7124303","isNumber":"7133661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7124303","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7133661","articleId":"7133866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7133940,"authors":[{"name":"Gheorghe-Eugen Subtirelu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Gheorghe-Eugen","lastName":"Subtirelu","id":"37085386698"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7514-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2068-7966"}],"articleNumber":"7133940","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Instruments","Data acquisition","Resistors","Capacitors","Resistance","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","integrated circuit design","operational amplifiers","signal sampling","virtual instrumentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifier circuits","virtual instrumentation system","Op Amps","schematic diagram","simulation tools","data acquisition board","LabVIEW","analog signals","adder","integrator amplifier","power supply","signal generator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["operational amplifier","teaching system","virtual instrumentation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7133940","doi":"10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133661","publicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7124303/7133661/07133940.pdf","startPage":"828","endPage":"833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation versus real world of operational amplifier circuits","abstract":"This paper present a virtual instrumentation system for learning the Operational Amplifiers (Op Amps) circuits function, design and analysis.

Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we provide in this paper. Moreover, since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types, having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management, we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java, while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources, according to each type of service customers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic resource provisioning through Fog micro datacenter","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)","doi":"10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134002","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122693/7133953/07134002.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic resource provisioning through Fog micro datacenter","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7134002/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15242334","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic resource provisioning through Fog micro datacenter","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p105aazam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052693S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122693","isNumber":"7133953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122693","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"7133953","articleId":"7134002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7134019,"authors":[{"name":"Bo\u017eidara Cvetkovi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Systems, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Bo\u017eidara","lastName":"Cvetkovi\u0107","id":"37085362798"},{"name":"Vito Janko","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Systems, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Vito","lastName":"Janko","id":"37085365194"},{"name":"Mitja Lu\u0161trek","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Systems, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Mitja","lastName":"Lu\u0161trek","id":"37085346687"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8425-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7134019","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel method for activity recognition and estimation of human energy expenditure with a smartphone and an optional heart-rate monitor.

The many possible variations of sensors, feature representations, machine learning algorithms, middle-ware architectures, reasoning/decision schemes, and interactive strategies make research and development tasks non-trivial to solve. In this paper, the use of a portable, flexible and holistic smart home demonstrator is proposed to facilitate iterative development and the acquisition of feedback when testing in regard to the above-mentioned issues. Specifically, the focus in this paper is on scenarios involving anomaly detection and response. First a model for anomaly detection is trained with simulated data representing a priori knowledge pertaining to a person living in an apartment. Then a reasoning mechanism uses the trained model to infer and plan a reaction to deviating activities. Reactions are carried out by a mobile interactive robot to investigate if a detected anomaly constitutes a true emergency. The implemented demonstrator was able to detect and respond properly in 18 of 20 trials featuring normal and deviating activity patterns, suggesting the feasibility of the proposed approach for such scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122693/7133953/07134058.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)","doi":"10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A holistic smart home demonstrator for anomaly detection and response","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Smart homes","Cognition","Intelligent sensors","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","home automation","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["holistic smart home demonstrator","anomaly detection","machine learning method","feature representation","middle-ware architecture","interactive strategy","feedback","reasoning mechanism","mobile interactive robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"A holistic smart home demonstrator for anomaly detection and response","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7134058/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15272585","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A holistic smart home demonstrator for anomaly detection and response","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p330lundstrom.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045896S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122693","isNumber":"7133953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7133953","articleId":"7134058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7134083,"authors":[{"name":"Manoranjan Dash","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Manoranjan","lastName":"Dash"},{"name":"Kee Kiat Koo","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Kee Kiat","lastName":"Koo"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o B\u00e1rtolo Gomes","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o B\u00e1rtolo","lastName":"Gomes"},{"name":"Shonali Priyadarsini Krishnaswamy","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Shonali Priyadarsini","lastName":"Krishnaswamy"},{"name":"Daniel Rugeles","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Rugeles"},{"name":"Amy Shi-Nash","affiliation":["DataSpark, Singapore Telecommunications Limited, Singapore 239732"],"firstName":"Amy","lastName":"Shi-Nash"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8425-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7134083","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Accuracy","Predictive models","Data models","Poles and towers","Trajectory","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","entropy","feature extraction","pattern recognition","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next place prediction","mobility patterns","dynamic Bayesian network","location feature","day of the week feature","time of the day feature","ToD","least entropy","probability","ensemble","CDR data","Nokia mobile data","call detail records"]}],"abstract":"As technology to connect people across the world is advancing, there should be corresponding advancement in taking advantage of data that is generated out of such connection.

Three features (location, day of the week (DoW), and time of the day (ToD)) and their combinations are used to develop these models. Knowing that not all models work well for all situations, we developed three combined models using least entropy, highest probability and ensemble.

Emergency notification mechanism has to be hassle free and quick, in order to have efficient response for any disaster, health-fix, act of terrorism, etc. In this paper, we present service architecture for emergency alert, using Fog computing. Fog computing brings cloud resources close to the underlying devices and IoTs, which makes it ideal for latency sensitive services. Furthermore, Fog is used for offloading resource constrained devices. Our smart phone based service, known as Emergency Help Alert Mobile Cloud (E-HAMC) provides a quick way of notifying the relevant emergency dealing department, utilizing the services of Fog for offloading as well as pre-processing purposes. The service sends the location of incident and contacts the appropriate emergency dealing department automatically through already stored contact numbers. The emergency related information is then synchronized automatically from Fog to the Cloud, allowing further analysis and improvement in safety of the people and creates extended portfolio of services for the concerned authorities as well as the users. Performance in most certain scenarios is also evaluated and presented in this study, which shows the applicability of our system and its future prospects.","doi":"10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134091","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122693/7133953/07134091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133953","startPage":"518","endPage":"523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"E-HAMC: Leveraging Fog computing for emergency alert service","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"E-HAMC: Leveraging Fog computing for emergency alert service","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134091/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15257721","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7134091/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"E-HAMC: Leveraging Fog computing for emergency alert service","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p518aazam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04263S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122693","isNumber":"7133953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122693","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7133953","articleId":"7134091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7134094,"authors":[{"name":"Kamran Ali","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University The Burroughs, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Kamran","lastName":"Ali","id":"37085546054"},{"name":"Huan X.

They also helped us understand that organising and maintaining effective communication during the disaster are vital for the execution of rescue operations. As communication resources are often entirely or partially damaged by disasters, the demand for information and communication technology (ICT) services explosively increases just after the events. These situations instigate serious network traffic congestions and physical damage of ICT equipments and emergency ICT networks if uprooted as a pre-disaster network system. This article proposes a network architecture design by integrating the existing network infrastructure with the reinforcement of layers based techniques and cloud processing concepts. This resilient network architecture allows the ICT services to be launched within a reasonable short period of time of development. Furthermore, communication in a disaster is sustained by implementing a three-tier fortification of the overall network architecture which would also minimize the physical and logical redundancy for resilient and flexible ICT resources. As cloud processing will work as a parallel reinforced infrastructure, the proposed approach and network design will give new hope for the developing countries to consider cloud computing services for effectiveness and better dependability on the architecture to save ICT and humanitarian network at the time of disaster.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Earthquakes","Emergency services","Cities and towns","Cloud computing","Reliability","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","emergency management","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural disasters","rescue operations","communication resources","information and communication technology services","ICT services explosively","network traffic congestions","ICT equipments","emergency ICT networks","pre-disaster network system","layers based techniques","cloud processing concepts","three-tier fortification","physical redundancy","logical redundancy","parallel reinforced infrastructure","cloud computing services"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134094","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122693/7133953/07134094.pdf","startPage":"537","endPage":"542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7133953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disaster management communication networks: Challenges and architecture design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Disaster management communication networks: Challenges and architecture design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134094/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7134094/","accessionNumber":"15257703","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disaster management communication networks: Challenges and architecture design","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p537ali.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074648S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122693","isNumber":"7133953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7133953","articleId":"7134094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7134694,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Mei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Yan Mei Wang received the B.Eng.

Fabricated using bulk micromachining technique, the mechanical sensor with a cantilever structure achieves a high sensitivity and low noise feature. An autozero time-multiplexed differential capacitance-to-voltage converter (AZTMD-CVC) is proposed in the SC readout interface. The CVC is based on a simple single-ended topology to yield a time-multiplexed differential output. As such, dc offset, 1/f noise, thermal drift, and component mismatch errors are significantly reduced in form of common mode errors through the time-multiplexed differential operation. In addition, the thermal noise of the AZTMD-CVC is analyzed and optimized with power so as to achieve good noise-power efficiency. The application specified IC chip is fabricated using 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS technology and draws a total current of 240 \u03bcA at a \u00b12.5 V supply. The accelerometer system's sensitivity is 1.95 V/g.

In this paper, by using independent component analysis (ICA) and multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD), the ICA-based MEMD method was proposed to remove EOG artifacts (EOAs) from multichannel EEG signals. First, the EEG signals were decomposed by the MEMD into multiple multivariate intrinsic mode functions (MIMFs). The EOG-related components were then extracted by reconstructing the MIMFs corresponding to EOAs. After performing the ICA of EOG-related signals, the EOG-linked independent components were distinguished and rejected. Finally, the clean EEG signals were reconstructed by implementing the inverse transform of ICA and MEMD. The results of simulated and real data suggested that the proposed method could successfully eliminate EOAs from EEG signals and preserve useful EEG information with little loss. By comparing with other existing techniques, the proposed method achieved much improvement in terms of the increase of signal-to-noise and the decrease of mean square error after removing EOAs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Removal of EOG Artifacts From EEG Signals Using Independent Component Analysis and Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2015.2450196","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7558265/07134704.pdf","startPage":"1301","endPage":"1308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2015.2450196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7558265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"The Removal of EOG Artifacts From EEG Signals Using Independent Component Analysis and Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7134704/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16282776","pubMedId":"26126290","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"81201162 and 61471291"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2013JQ8007"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Removal of EOG Artifacts From EEG Signals Using Independent Component Analysis and Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition","sourcePdf":"jbhi-wang-2450196-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085147S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7558265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7558265","articleId":"7134704","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7134717,"authors":[{"name":"T.

However, as the required threshold voltage is lowered, the number of samples and, in turn, the data rate and the energy consumed by the overall system increases. In this paper, we present a cubic Hermitian vector-based technique for online compression of asynchronously sampled electrocardiogram signals. The proposed method is computationally efficient data compression. The algorithm has complexity O(n), thus well suited for asynchronous ADCs. Our algorithm requires no data buffering, maintaining the energy advantage of asynchronous ADCs. The proposed method of compression has a compression ratio of up to 90% with achievable percentage root-mean-square difference ratios as a low as 0.97. The algorithm preserves the superior feature-to-feature timing accuracy of asynchronously sampled signals. These advantages are achieved in a computationally efficient manner since algorithm boundary parameters for the signals are extracted a priori.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2449901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7331704/07134717.pdf","startPage":"2878","endPage":"2887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2449901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bufferless Compression of Asynchronously Sampled ECG Signals in Cubic Hermitian Vector Space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134717/","displayDocTitle":"Bufferless Compression of Asynchronously Sampled ECG Signals in Cubic Hermitian Vector Space","volume":"62","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601900","pubMedId":"26126269","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7134717/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Commission for Technology and Innovation CTI","grantNumber":"10717.1-PFLS-LS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bufferless Compression of Asynchronously Sampled ECG Signals in Cubic Hermitian Vector Space","sourcePdf":"tbme-marisa-2449901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139995S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7331704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7331704","articleId":"7134717","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7134725,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Makki","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7182396/7134725/makki-2449842_print-small.gif","p":["Behrooz Makki was born in Tehran, Iran.

A powerful way to reduce the completion time of an application in a mobile device is to offload its tasks to nearby cloudlets, which consist of clusters of computers. Although there is a significant body of research in mobile cloudlet offloading technology, there has been very little attention paid to how cloudlets should be placed in a given network to optimize mobile application performance. In this paper we study cloudlet placement and mobile user allocation to the cloudlets in a wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN). We devise an algorithm for the problem, which enables the placement of the cloudlets at user dense regions of the WMAN, and assigns mobile users to the placed cloudlets while balancing their workload. We also conduct experiments through simulation. The simulation results indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is very promising.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2449834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8128654/07134728.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8128654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2449834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Cloudlet Placement and User to Cloudlet Allocation in Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Cloudlet Placement and User to Cloudlet Allocation in Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134728/","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17416426","htmlLink":"/document/7134728/","volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Cloudlet Placement and User to Cloudlet Allocation in Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks","sourcePdf":"tcc-jia-2449834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08783S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8128654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"8128654","articleId":"7134728","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7134740,"authors":[{"name":"Yibin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7875385/7134740/li-2442994-small.gif","p":["\n\nYibin Li received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K., in 2009.","During his Ph.D. wrap-up stage, he was with The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, U.K. In 2010, he joined the Embedded Group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China, as an Associate Professor.

It must be low energy consuming and highly reliable to deal with the simple but frequent interactions with the cloud, which constitutes the cloud-integrated CPS. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has emerged as a critical technique to leverage power management by lowering the supply voltage and frequency of processors. In this paper, based on the DVS technique, we propose a novel Energy-aware Dynamic Task Scheduling (EDTS) algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption for smartphones, while satisfying stringent time constraints and the probability constraint for applications. Experimental results indicate that the EDTS algorithm can significantly reduce energy consumption for CPS, as compared to the critical path scheduling method and the parallelism-based scheduling algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2442994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2442994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7875385/07134740.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7875385","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4267003/7875385/7134740-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy Optimization With Dynamic Task Scheduling Mobile Cloud Computing","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16724803","htmlLink":"/document/7134740/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2011DFR20090 and 2014DFR70730"},{"fundingName":"Public Science and Technology Research Funds Projects of Ocean","grantNumber":"201205036-04"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1457506"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"2011CB302505"},{"fundingName":"GuangDong Foundation Team","grantNumber":"201001D0104726115"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Energy Optimization With Dynamic Task Scheduling Mobile Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"jsyst-qiu-2442994-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141667S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7875385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7875385","articleId":"7134740","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7134741,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Selva","affiliation":["Instituto di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara, CNR Area della Ricerca di Firenze, Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7175093/7134741/selva-2440092-small.gif","p":["Massimo Selva was born in Florence, Italy, in 1974.

In fact, due to the development of new instruments, thinking only in terms of pansharpening is reductive. Even though some expressions as hyperspectral (HS) pansharpening already exist, there is not a suitable definition when multispectral/hyperspectral data are used as source to extract spatial details. After defining the hypersharpening framework, we draw the readers' attention to its peculiar characteristics, by proposing and evaluating two hypersharpening methods. Experiments are carried out on the data produced by the updated version of SIM-GA imager, designed by Selex ES, which is composed by a panchromatic camera and two spectrometers in the VNIR and SWIR spectral ranges, respectively. Owing to the different resolution factors among panchromatic, VNIR and SWIR data sets, we can apply hypersharpening to fuse SWIR data to VNIR resolution. Comparisons of hypersharpening with \u201ctraditional\u201d pansharpening show hypersharpening is more effective.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7175093/07134741.pdf","startPage":"3008","endPage":"3024","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2440092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2440092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7175093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyper-Sharpening: A First Approach on SIM-GA Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","displayDocTitle":"Hyper-Sharpening: A First Approach on SIM-GA Data","htmlLink":"/document/7134741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15360450","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003981","fundingName":"Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI)","grantNumber":"CNR-IFAC/SOASAR/111213"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyper-Sharpening: A First Approach on SIM-GA Data","sourcePdf":"jstars-selva-2440092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108945S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7175093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7175093","articleId":"7134741","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7134754,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo P.

The PAM consists of a power amplifier (PA), a buck converter, and a power detector. Two packaging technologies were used to integrate the compact module: a low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology and a ferrite-filled printed circuit board (PCB) technology. The LTCC portion includes radio-frequency inductors, capacitors, transmission lines, and interconnection lines to minimize the overall size, while a power inductor for the buck converter is implemented in ferrite-filled PCB. The PA and the buck converter are designed in 2-\u03bcm InGaP/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor technology and 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS technology, respectively. The output power level is converted into a voltage by the power detector, and the voltage controls the buck converter, thereby optimizing the supply voltage of the PA. This adaptive supply voltage helps to improve the power-added efficiency (PAE) in the low-power regime while maintaining linearity. The PAM showed an error vector magnitude of less than 4% up to an output power of 22 dBm. The PAE is 8% and 11% at output powers of 11 and 16 dBm, respectively, representing respective improvements of 60% and 43%. The overall size of the PAM is 5\u00d77.5\u00d71.2 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2443020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2443020","startPage":"887","endPage":"894","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7161436/07134755.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7161436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Wi-Fi Power Amplifier LTCC Module Using a Buck Converter With a Power Inductor Implemented in Ferrite-Filled PCB Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Wi-Fi Power Amplifier LTCC Module Using a Buck Converter With a Power Inductor Implemented in Ferrite-Filled PCB Technology","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"5","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7134755/","accessionNumber":"15305841","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134755/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea within the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2013R1A1A2004931"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Wi-Fi Power Amplifier LTCC Module Using a Buck Converter With a Power Inductor Implemented in Ferrite-Filled PCB Technology","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-yoon-2443020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062448S","chronDate":"July  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7161436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7161436","articleId":"7134755","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7134756,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7182396/7134756/choi-2449860_print-small.gif","p":["\nJinho Choi (SM'02) was born in Seoul, Korea.

Exploiting a certain sparsity of mm-wave channels, a low-complexity beam selection method for beamforming by low-cost analog beamformers is derived. It is shown that beam selection can be carried out without explicit channel estimation using the notion of compressive sensing (CS). Due to various reasons (e.g., the background noise and interference), some users may choose the same BS beam, which results in high inter-user interference. To overcome this problem, we further consider BS beam selection by users. Through simulations, we show that the performance gap between the proposed approach and the optimal beamforming approach, which requires full channel state information (CSI), becomes narrower for a larger number of users at a moderate/low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Since the optimal beamforming approach is difficult to be used due to prohibitively high computational complexity for large antenna arrays with a large number of users, the proposed approach becomes attractive for BSs and users in mm-wave systems where large antenna arrays can be employed.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2449860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2449860","startPage":"2936","endPage":"2947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7182396/07134756.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Selection in mm-Wave Multiuser MIMO Systems Using Compressive Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Beam Selection in mm-Wave Multiuser MIMO Systems Using Compressive Sensing","volume":"63","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15359428","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7134756/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Selection in mm-Wave Multiuser MIMO Systems Using Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"tcomm-choi-2449860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108833S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7182396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7182396","articleId":"7134756","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7134764,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Toni","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Signal Processing Laboratory - LTS4, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Laura Toni, (S\u201907\u2013M\u201908) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Toni","id":"37568248100"},{"name":"Thomas Maugey","affiliation":["INRIA-Rennes, Centre INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes Cedex, France"],"bio":{"p":["Thomas Maugey, (S\u201908\u2013M\u201909) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Maugey","id":"37395074500"},{"name":"Pascal Frossard","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Signal Processing Laboratory - LTS4, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Pascal Frossard, (S\u201997\u2013A\u201901\u2013M\u201901\u2013SM\u201904) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Frossard","id":"37285156300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-9210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7134764","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits &amp; Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Navigation","Distortion","Dynamic scheduling","Optimization","Scheduling algorithms","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","channel coding","client-server systems","computational complexity","computerised navigation","multimedia communication","optimisation","quality of experience","telecommunication computing","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized packet scheduling","multiview video navigation system","coding strategy","transmission strategies","multicamera system","bottleneck channel","central server","quality of experience","scene distortion","rate-distortion model","scene reconstruction","objective function","interactive client navigation model","multivariate optimization problem","computation complexity reduction","PSNR quality gain","baseline scheduling policy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlated sources","interactive multiview streaming","multiview navigation","packet scheduling"]}],"abstract":"We study coding and transmission strategies in multicamera systems, where correlated sources send data through a bottleneck channel to a central server, which eventually transmits views to different interactive users. We propose a dynamic navigation -path aware packet scheduling optimization under delay, bandwidth, and interactivity constraints aimed at optimizing the quality-of-experience of interactive users. In particular , the scene distortion is minimized jointly with the distortion variations along most likely navigation paths. The optimization relies both on a novel rate-distortion model, which captures the importance of each view in the scene reconstruction , and on an objective function that optimizes resources based on a client navigation model. The latter takes into account the distortion experienced by interactive clients as well as the distortion variations that might be observed by clients during multiview navigation. We solve the scheduling problem with a novel trellis-based solution, which permits to formally decompose the multivariate optimization problem, thereby significantly reducing the computation complexity. Simulation results show the PSNR quality gain offered by the proposed algorithm compared to baseline scheduling policies. Finally, we show that the best scheduling policy consistently adapts to the most likely user navigation path and that it minimizes distortion variations that can be very disturbing for users in traditional navigation systems.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2015.2450020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7182813/07134764.pdf","startPage":"1604","endPage":"1616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2015.2450020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Packet Scheduling in Multiview Video Navigation Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134764/","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Packet Scheduling in Multiview Video Navigation Systems","volume":"17","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364355","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7134764/","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003475","fundingName":"Hasler Stiftung"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Schweizerische Nationalfonds zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Packet Scheduling in Multiview Video Navigation Systems","sourcePdf":"tmm-toni-2450020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091086S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7182813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7182813","articleId":"7134764","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7134767,"authors":[{"name":"Angel Sapena-Ba\u00f1\u00f3","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7293766/7134767/sapen-2444240-small.gif","p":["Angel Sapena-Ba\u00f1\u00f3 received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain, in 2009.","He has been a Researcher with the Institute for Energy Engineering, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, since 2008.

Nevertheless, the implementation of the wavelet transform (WT), especially on embedded or low-power devices, faces practical problems, such as the election of the mother wavelet, the tuning of its parameters, the coordination between the sampling frequency and the levels of the transform, and the construction of the bank of wavelet filters, with highly different bandwidths that constitute the core of the DWT. In this paper, a diagnostic system using the harmonic WT is proposed, which can alleviate these practical problems because it is built using a single fast Fourier transform of one phase's current. The harmonic wavelet was conceived to perform musical analysis, hence its name, and it has spread into many fields, but, to the best of the authors' knowledge, it has not been applied before to perform fault diagnosis of rotating electrical machines in transient regime using the stator current. The simplicity and performance of the proposed approach are assessed by comparison with other types of WTs, and it has been validated with the experimental diagnosis of a 3.15-MW induction motor with broken bars.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2015.2444240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7293766/07134767.pdf","startPage":"3137","endPage":"3146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2015.2444240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7293766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Electrical Machines in Transient Regime Using a Single Stator Current\u2019s FFT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134767/","displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Electrical Machines in Transient Regime Using a Single Stator Current\u2019s FFT","volume":"64","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15519452","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7134767/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n through the Programa Nacional de Proyectos de Investigaci\u00f3n Fundamental","grantNumber":"DPI2011-23740"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Electrical Machines in Transient Regime Using a Single Stator Current\u2019s FFT","sourcePdf":"tim-sanchez-2444240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077348S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7293766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7293766","articleId":"7134767","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7134769,"authors":[{"name":"Mario di Bernardo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy","Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/7410136/7134769/diber-2437336-small.gif","p":["Mario di Bernardo (S\u201906\u2013F\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree in nonlinear dynamics and control from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., in 1998.","He is currently a Full Professor of Automatic Control at the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.

The problem of controlling the vehicles within a platoon, so that they converge to their desired velocities and intervehicle distances, is formulated as a high-order network consensus problem. By means of Lyapunov-Razumikhin functions, convergence is proven of the platoon to the desired consensus speed and intervehicle spacing under both fixed and switching communication network topologies, thus confirming the capability of the proposed approach to cope with maneuvers where vehicles join or leave the platoon and communication failures. Tuning criteria for the control gains are provided to guarantee string stability under the proposed control law. Finally, results of numerical simulations and in-vehicle experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a three-vehicle platoon.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","volume":"24","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"15787100","publicationDate":"March 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7134769/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design, Analysis, and Experimental Validation of a Distributed Protocol for Platooning in the Presence of Time-Varying Heterogeneous Delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Analysis, and Experimental Validation of a Distributed Protocol for Platooning in the Presence of Time-Varying Heterogeneous Delays","sourcePdf":"tcst-salvi-2437336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098071S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"7410136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7410136","articleId":"7134769","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7134773,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwei Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhiwei Zeng (M\u201904\u2013SM\u201908) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA, in 2003.","He held a post-doctoral position with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA, from 2003 to 2009.

Its accurate and efficient modeling is critical to probe and testing parameter optimization. The finite-element method (FEM) has been widely used in ECT simulation. Unfortunately, the conventional FEM is cumbersome and inefficient when the movement of a ferrite-core coil is to be considered, because the change of the coil position results in repetition of meshing as well as generating and preconditioning matrix equation. In this paper, we resolve the problem by dividing the solution domain into subdomains. The test sample and the ferrite core are assigned to different subdomains, and each subdomain is meshed independently. The excitation coil is not included in a subdomain, and its contributions to the magnetic fields in both subdomains are calculated analytically. Solutions of the subdomains are coupled by calculating the contribution of the induced current or magnetization current in a subdomain to the magnetic field in the other subdomain. The proposed method has the merits of easy mesh generation and efficient and accurate solution.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2450194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7270377/07134773.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2450194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270377","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Domain Decomposition Finite-Element Method for Eddy-Current Testing Simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Domain Decomposition Finite-Element Method for Eddy-Current Testing Simulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","isJournal":true,"externalId":"6202009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456510","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7134773/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20120121110026"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-09-0682"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51277154 and 60979012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Domain Decomposition Finite-Element Method for Eddy-Current Testing Simulation","sourcePdf":"tmag-zeng-2450194-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127238S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7270377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7270377","articleId":"7134773","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7134776,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Kuk Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Kuk","lastName":"Lim","id":"38477198500"},{"name":"Kyung-Pyo Yi","affiliation":["Korea Railroad Research Institute, Uiwang, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung-Pyo","lastName":"Yi","id":"37085390663"},{"name":"Sang-Yong Jung","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, SungKyunKwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Yong","lastName":"Jung","id":"37335318600"},{"name":"Hyun-Kyo Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Kyo","lastName":"Jung","id":"37085385170"},{"name":"Jong-Suk Ro","affiliation":["Brain Korea 21 Plus, Creative Research Engineer Development, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Suk","lastName":"Ro","id":"38667510800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7134776","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1521},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"To optimize an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) design for a fuel cell electric vehicle, a new surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm is proposed in this paper.

However, heavy communication loads negatively impact such awareness requirements due to communication impairments, ranging from strict capacity limitations of DSRC channels to correlated packet collisions due to periodic communication patterns. Transmission control strategies may adapt power or rate to control such impairments but risk missing the requirements of cooperative safety applications. In this paper, we design a new awareness control strategy by implementing a spatial awareness framework. Specifically, we adapt the distribution of the awareness-quality as a function of the awareness-range. Therefore, we first propose random transmit power control (RTPC), which manages to provide different levels of awareness-quality at different ranges, while mitigating correlated packet collisions by randomizing them in space. As RTPC is able to reduce the channel load, we secondly propose to combine RTPC with transmit rate control (TRC) and to benefit from the gained channel resources by subsequently increasing the update-rate and by implication, the quality of position-awareness. The spatial awareness control capability of RTPC+TRC has been evaluated through simulations. We discuss the influence of RTPC+TRC on cooperative safety applications exemplarily for the forward collision warning (FCW) application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Transmit Power Control for DSRC and its Application to Cooperative Safety","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2015.2449845","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858/7381712/07134778.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2015.2449845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7381712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Random Transmit Power Control for DSRC and its Application to Cooperative Safety","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7134778/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697099","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Transmit Power Control for DSRC and its Application to Cooperative Safety","sourcePdf":"tdsc-kloiber-2449845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092661S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"7381712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7381712","articleId":"7134778","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7134782,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongming Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7445928/7134782/zheng-small.gif","p":["Zhongming Zheng received the BEng.

Specifically, we exploit the location information of sensors and randomly select witnesses located in a ring area to verify the legitimacy of sensors and to report detected clone attacks. The ring structure facilitates energy-efficient data forwarding along the path towards the witnesses and the sink. We theoretically prove that the proposed protocol can achieve \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n percent clone detection probability with trustful witnesses. We further extend the work by studying the clone detection performance with untrustful witnesses and show that the clone detection probability still approaches \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\"> $98$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n percent when \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$10$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n percent of witnesses are compromised.

It is known that the disadvantages of robust control for the NARMA model are as follows: 1) suitable control parameters for larger time delay are more sensitive to achieving desirable performance; 2) it only deals with bounded uncertainty; and 3) the nominal NARMA model must be learned in advance. Due to the dynamic feature of the NARMA model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is online applied to learn it. However, the system performance becomes deteriorated due to the poor learning of the larger variation of system vector functions. In this situation, a simple network is employed to compensate the upper bound of the residue caused by the linear parameterization of the approximation error of RNN. An e-modification learning law with a projection for weight matrix is applied to guarantee its boundedness without persistent excitation. Under suitable conditions, the semiglobally ultimately bounded tracking with the boundedness of estimated weight matrix is obtained by the proposed RNN-based multivariable adaptive control. Finally, simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2442437","startPage":"388","endPage":"401","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7384789/07134791.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2442437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Multivariable Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems With Time-Varying Delay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear dynamical systems","Delays","Autoregressive processes","Recurrent neural networks","Switches","Time-varying systems","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","autoregressive moving average processes","delays","matrix algebra","multivariable control systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","recurrent neural nets","robust control","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","RNN","multivariable adaptive control","nonlinear autoregressive moving average","multivariable nonlinear dynamic systems","time-varying delay","robust control","bounded uncertainty","nominal NARMA model","system vector functions","linear parameterization","e-modification learning law","weight matrix projection","semiglobally ultimately bounded tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lyapunov stability theory","multivariable sliding-mode control","nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA)","recurrent neural network (RNN)."]},{"kwd":["Lyapunov stability theory","multivariable sliding-mode control","nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA)","recurrent neural network (RNN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134791/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Multivariable Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems With Time-Varying Delay","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7134791/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15721748","pubMedId":"26126287","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Multivariable Adaptive Control for a Class of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems With Time-Varying Delay","sourcePdf":"tnnls-hwang-2442437-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086547S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7384789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7384789","articleId":"7134791","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":7134793,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7317845/7134793/zhou-small.gif","p":["Yan Zhou received the PhD degree in computer science from the State\n University of New York at Binghamton in 2011.

The experimental results show that our approach closely supports the target DDR bound and service differentiation requirements among the service classes unlike the tested baselines representing the current state of the art in real-time database research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134793/","volume":"27","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7134793/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15573782","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deadline Assignment and Feedback Control for Differentiated Real-Time Data Services","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS-1117352"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deadline Assignment and Feedback Control for Differentiated Real-Time Data Services","sourcePdf":"tkde-zhou-2441725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090445S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7317845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7317845","articleId":"7134793","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7134796,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7217861/7134796/7134796-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Liu (S\u201914\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Eng degree from the Tianjin University, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the National University of Singapore in 2014.

Here, we consider a general antenna deployment method for wireless networks, termed multi-antenna C-RAN, where a flexible number of antennas can be equipped at each RRH to more effectively balance the performance and fronthaul complexity tradeoff beyond the conventional massive MIMO and single-antenna C-RAN. To coordinate and control the fronthaul traffic over multi-antenna RRHs, under the uplink communication setup, we propose a new \u201cspatial-compression-and-forward (SCF)\u201d scheme, where each RRH first performs a linear spatial filtering to denoise and maximally compress its received signals from multiple users to a reduced number of dimensions, then conducts uniform scalar quantization over each of the resulting dimensions in parallel, and finally sends the total quantized bits via a finite-rate fronthaul link to the baseband unit (BBU) for joint information decoding. Under this scheme, we maximize the minimum SINR of all users at the BBU by a joint resource allocation over the wireless transmission and fronthaul links. Specifically, each RRH determines its own spatial filtering solution in a distributed manner to reduce the signaling overhead with the BBU, while the BBU jointly optimizes the users' transmit power, the RRHs' fronthaul bits allocation, and the BBU's receive beamforming with fixed spatial filters at individual RRHs. Numerical results show that, given a total number of antennas to be deployed, multi-antenna C-RAN with the proposed SCF and joint optimization significantly outperforms both massive MIMO and single-antenna C-RAN under practical fronthaul capacity constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2450199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2450199","startPage":"5083","endPage":"5095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7217861/07134796.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Uplink Transmission in Multi-Antenna C-RAN With Spatial Compression and Forward","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Uplink Transmission in Multi-Antenna C-RAN With Spatial Compression and Forward","volume":"63","issue":"19","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15400740","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7134796/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Uplink Transmission in Multi-Antenna C-RAN With Spatial Compression and Forward","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2450199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095602S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7217861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7217861","articleId":"7134796","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7134800,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves (MoE), Department of Communication Science and Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7321101/7134800/wang-2449843-small.gif","p":["\n\nXin Wang (SM'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA, in 2004, all in electrical engineering.","From September 2004 to August 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.

This new proposal is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization problem, which employs generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) and branch-and-bound (BB) methods to determine the most adequate extension factor and the optimum set of input symbols to be extended within a proper quarter plane of the constellation. The optimum technique based on GBD, which is denoted as GBD for constellation extension (GBDCE), provides a bound with relevant improvement in terms of PAPR reduction compared with other CE techniques, although it may exhibit slow convergence. To avoid excessive processing time in practical systems, the suboptimum BB for constellation extension (BBCE) scheme is proposed. Simulation results show that BBCE achieves a significant PAPR reduction, providing a good tradeoff between complexity and performance. We also show that the BBCE scheme performs satisfactorily in terms of power spectral density and bit error rate in the presence of a nonlinear high-power amplifier.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07134804.pdf","startPage":"5133","endPage":"5145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2450178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2450178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction via Constellation Extension in OFDM Systems Using Generalized Benders Decomposition and Branch-and-Bound Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Minimization","Optimization","Bit error rate","Predistortion","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","integer programming","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","radio transmitters","radiofrequency amplifiers","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","constellation extension-based approach","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","generalized benders decomposition","GBD","branch-and-bound techniques","transmitter side","mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization problem","GBDCE","suboptimum BB","BBCE","power spectral density","bit error rate","nonlinear high-power amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Branch-and-bound (BB)","constellation extension (CE)","generalized benders decomposition (GBD)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak power reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction via Constellation Extension in OFDM Systems Using Generalized Benders Decomposition and Branch-and-Bound Techniques","volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7134804/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141220","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish National Projects GRE3N-SYST","grantNumber":"TEC2011-29006-C03-03"},{"fundingName":"COMONSENS","grantNumber":"CSD2008-00010"},{"fundingName":"SENESCYT (Ecuador)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction via Constellation Extension in OFDM Systems Using Generalized Benders Decomposition and Branch-and-Bound Techniques","sourcePdf":"tvt-paredesparedes-2450178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117706S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7134804","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7134808,"authors":[{"name":"Feiran Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Acoustics and the Key Laboratory of Noise and Vibration Research, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7217861/7134808/7134808-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feiran Yang (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2005, the M.S. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IACAS), Beijing, China, in 2013.

When the projection order and/or the number of subbands is increased, the convergence rate of the IMSAF algorithm improves at the cost of increased complexity. Thus, this paper proposes several approaches to reduce the complexity of the IMSAF algorithm, both in error vector calculation and matrix inversion operation. Specifically, three approaches are developed to efficiently calculate error vector. The first approach gives an approximate filtering, whereas the other two approaches can provide a fast exact filtering with or without update of the weight vector explicitly based on a recursive scheme. The decorrelation property of IMSAF is determined, and two simplified variants are developed to reduce the complexity as by-products, i.e., the simplified IMSAF (SIMSAF) and pseudo IMSAF algorithms. Then, we discuss the problem of solving a linear system of equations. The performance advantages, limitations, and preferable applications of various methods are analyzed and discussed. Computer simulations are conducted in the context of system identification to determine the principle and efficiency of the proposed fast algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2450198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7217861/07134808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2450198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217861","startPage":"5133","endPage":"5148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Implementation of the Improved Multiband-Structured Subband Adaptive Filter Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Implementation of the Improved Multiband-Structured Subband Adaptive Filter Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"19","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15411935","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7134808/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Implementation of the Improved Multiband-Structured Subband Adaptive Filter Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tsp-yang-2450198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127483S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7217861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7217861","articleId":"7134808","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7134810,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Lun Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7410169/7134810/tsai-2440658-small.gif","p":["Jia-Lun Tsai received the M.S. degree in e-learning from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in information management from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), Taipei, Taiwan, in 2013.","He is currently with the Department of Information Management and the Taiwan Information Security Center, NTUST.

In order to support secure communications between smart meters and service providers, key management for authentication becomes a crucial security topic. Recently, several key distribution schemes have been proposed to provide secure communications for smart grid. However, these schemes do not support smart meter anonymity and possess security weaknesses. This paper utilizes an identity-based signature scheme and an identity-based encryption scheme to propose a new anonymous key distribution scheme for smart grid environments. In the proposed scheme, a smart meter can anonymously access services provided by service providers using one private key without the help of the trusted anchor during authentication. In addition, the proposed scheme requires only a few of computation operations at the smart meter side. Security analysis is conducted to prove the proposed scheme is secure under random oracle model.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7410169/07134810.pdf","startPage":"906","endPage":"914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2440658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2440658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7134810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Anonymous Key Distribution Scheme for Smart Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart meters","Authentication","Smart grids","Servers","Elliptic curve cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","power system security","smart meters","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random oracle model","security analysis","authentication","smart grid environments","identity-based encryption scheme","identity-based signature scheme","secure communications","service providers","smart meters","smart grid environments","information management","secure anonymous key distribution scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Identity-based encryption","identity-based signature","key distribution","privacy","smart grid"]},{"kwd":["Identity-based encryption","identity-based signature","key distribution","privacy","smart grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7134810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Secure Anonymous Key Distribution Scheme for Smart Grid","volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7134810/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786874","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Taiwan Information Security Center"},{"fundingName":"National Science Council of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-011-091-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Anonymous Key Distribution Scheme for Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-tsai-2440658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073993S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7410169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"7410169","articleId":"7134810","onlineDate":"25 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7134817,"authors":[{"name":"Vitor C.

These motors have to endure and cope with a wide variety of environments and conditions, so with time gradually developing (incipient) faults build up. If the fault is not trace out in embryonic state, it leads degradation which eventually causes potential failure of the motors and huge economic loss in industry. Around two fifth incipient faults happen due to stator faults caused by mainly failure of inter-turn insulation. So this paper proposed an innovative idea to detect induction motor stator's inter-turn short circuit fault using noninvasive heuristic approach by Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In this fault detection research, a 0.5 hp, single phase 50 Hz induction motor at no load condition is used as an experimental prototype. Generalized Feed forward neural network is used as NN with Levenberg Marquardt gradient descend algorithm for training. Three input parameters (motor current, supply voltage and rotor speed) develop the feature space of NN to detect whether the motor is faulty or not by analyzing performance function.

One major challenge in precoder operation is the difficulty in obtaining the full channel state information on transmitter (CSIT). In this work, we investigate the precoder design for SSK-MIMO systems with limited feedback through using the codebook for the precoding. We formulate a distortion metric to evaluate the quality of a codebook based on the maximum minimum Euclidean distance criterion and propose a codebook design criterion accordingly. Two effective codebook design algorithms are proposed based on thorough analysis of the criterion.

In a MIMO-OFDM frequency division duplex (FDD) system, the amount of CSI required by the transmitter increases linear with the number of subcarriers, and therefore becomes prohibitive for a large bandwidth configuration. Conventional schemes based on broadband analog CSI feedback can reduce the overhead, but has limitations to achieve higher spectral efficiency and feedback robustness. In this paper we first propose a novel broadband analog CSI feedback framework for MIMO-OFDM systems based on the distributed compressive sensing (DCS) theory. Then, we further optimize this framework to maximize its feedback benefits. By exploiting the sparse common support (joint sparsity) inherent in MIMO channels and taking advantage of the high efficiency of DCS in encoding original MIMO channels, the proposed framework is capable of significantly reducing the overhead and enhancing the robustness. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM channel feedback based on distributed compressive sensing: A new perspective","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136125","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136125.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM channel feedback based on distributed compressive sensing: A new perspective","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136125/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257271","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM channel feedback based on distributed compressive sensing: A new perspective","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p21peng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070589S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136126,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhan Zheng","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Yuhan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085537034"},{"name":"Fei Qi","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085531890"},{"name":"Xinzhou Cheng","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Xinzhou","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085527322"},{"name":"Xiao Jun Jing","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Xiao Jun","lastName":"Jing","id":"37532421600"},{"name":"Hai Huang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085543858"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136126","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Security","Physical layer","Wireless communication","Matching pursuit algorithms","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","diversity reception","information theory","MIMO communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","decryption method","CDD-OFDM transmission","covert orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transmission","cyclic delay diversity","multiple input multiple output technology","MIMO technology","multipath wireless channel","Shannon sampling theorem","channel estimation","uneven pilot arrangement","physical layer secret key"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an improved decryption method aiming at covert Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission with cyclic delay diversity (CDD) featured multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology.

In practice, however, the network operators are limited by the high costs associated with the provisioning of backhaul communication and power supply to the SCs. This paper addresses these operational challenges by using optical links at the same time for high-capacity backhaul and wireless power supply. In particular, we present an experimental design of an optical wireless link for energy harvesting (EH). Our system consists of (i) a high-brightness white light-emitting diode (WLED) with an output luminous flux of 2200 lm, and (ii) an amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar panel. The distance of the experimental link ranges from 0.5m to 5m. The visible-light EH from the solar panel is negatively affected by the Lambertian radiation pattern of the WLED. In order to increase the collimation of the source light, we use three optical elements - a spherical lens, a reflector, and a parabolic mirror. The latter is shown to achieve a gain of 28.4 dB in EH over a distance of 5 m compared to the non-collimated case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136132/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136132/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15257405","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the design of an optical wireless link for small cell backhaul communication and energy harvesting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of an optical wireless link for small cell backhaul communication and energy harvesting","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p58fakidis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058034S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136142,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy A.

Additionally the latest channel measurements and research have shown that mmWave frequencies are useable for a 5G-type local area access system. However, employing mmWave frequencies for outdoor local area access presents a challenge particularly from blockage of the signal from the mobile to the access point. Using the latest path loss equations from measured data, a newly developed mmWave channel environment, and a model for distance-dependence LOS blocking probability, system-level capacity results are presented for a dense urban environment. The results show that with adequate access point density that low outage probability can be obtained with cell-edge rates well in excess of 100 Mbps and cell-average user throughputs of up to 5.12 Gbps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System level modeling and performance of an outdoor mmWave local area access system","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136142","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136142.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"System level modeling and performance of an outdoor mmWave local area access system","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136142/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257318","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System level modeling and performance of an outdoor mmWave local area access system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p108thomas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052583S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136143,"authors":[{"name":"Yahia R.

We formulate the spatial diversity problem as maximizing the geometric mean of the projections of the RF precoder on the transmit steering vectors and the geometric mean of the projections of the RF combiner on the receive steering vectors. To solve the optimization problem of the RF beamformers, we propose a simple gradient ascent algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed spatial diversity scheme outperforms the other spatial diversity schemes in literature in case of no blockage and in case of blockage to any propagation path regardless of the number of propagation paths.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136143.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable RF beamforming for millimeter wave MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Spatial diversity","Arrays","Gain","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","gradient methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","optimisation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable RF beamforming","millimeter wave MIMO-OFDM systems","spatial diversity scheme","radiofrequency beamforming","partial channel knowledge assumption","transmitter","full channel knowledge","receiver","geometric mean maximization","RF precoder","transmit steering vectors","receive steering vectors","RF combiner","optimization problem","simple gradient ascent algorithm","propagation paths"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter wave","beamforming","spatial diversity","blockage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Reliable RF beamforming for millimeter wave MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257389","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable RF beamforming for millimeter wave MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p113ramadan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110583S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7136144,"authors":[{"name":"Pierluigi Vito Amadori","affiliation":["University College of London, UK"],"firstName":"Pierluigi Vito","lastName":"Amadori","id":"37085389977"},{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["University College of London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Masouros","id":"37299872300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136144","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Radio frequency","Interference","Channel models","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity transceivers","multiuser millimeter wave beamspace MIMO systems","millimeter wave transmission scheme","mm-wave transmission scheme","beamspace multi-input multi-output communications","B-MIMO communications","hardware complexity transceiver","mm-wave frequencies","radio frequency complexity","RF complexity","near optimal performances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High dimensional MIMO","Multiuser MIMO","beam selection","Capacity maximization","SINR maximization","beamforming","mm-wave communications","antenna arrays"]}],"abstract":"We present a new millimeter-wave (mm-wave) transmission scheme that combines beamspace Multi-Input Multi-Output (B-MIMO) communications and beam selection techniques to achieve near-optimal performances with a low hardware-complexity transceiver.

The proposed scheme is characterized by a reduced radio-frequency (RF) complexity, achieved through beam selection, while leading to near-optimal performances. The benefits of the proposed scheme are evaluated via performance computations, comparisons of numbers of required RF chains and a joint sum-rate and complexity metric that shows the trade-off between spectral and power efficiency.

In this contribution, without modifying the modeling framework, we proposed a semi-deterministic graph modeling approach by associating the scatterers with realistic environment objects, and by calculating the coefficients of the propagation paths on the base of a proven diffuse scattering theory. An isolated office building scenario is adopted to illustrate the procedure of the proposed method. The performance is thus evaluated by comparing the simulated power-delay-profiles (PDPs) with ray-tracing and real channel measurement data. The results illustrate that the proposed method can accurately predict both the decaying slopes and the diffuse tails of the PDPs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136151.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-deterministic modeling of diffuse scattering component based on propagation graph theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Buildings","Computational modeling","Reverberation","Graph theory","Delays","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","graph theory","multipath channels","radiowave propagation","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","PDP","power-delay profile","isolated office building scenario","diffuse scattering theory","propagation path coefficient","electromagnetic wave reverberation","multipath propagation","propagation graph theory-based channel modeling","diffuse scattering component semideterministic modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Semi-deterministic modeling of diffuse scattering component based on propagation graph theory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136151/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15272572","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-deterministic modeling of diffuse scattering component based on propagation graph theory","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p155tian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051516S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136152,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Torabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Torabi","id":"37085580184"},{"name":"Seyed A.

We also investigate the ESD spread within a cluster of rays and show that the ESD within a cluster depends significantly on the distance of the mobile from the base-station. This characterization addresses a gap in the existing literature.

Previous studies have come to different conclusions for the characterization of the dissimilarity in uplink and downlink channel properties. This paper analyzes the mismatch in directional properties of the uplink and downlink channels of FDD systems based on the power of their multipath clusters. At a system level, due to the limited directional resolution, the multipath components arriving at the base station are seen as clusters, rather than individual signal paths. This fact is used to describe the mismatch of directional properties between uplink and downlink. The contribution of this paper is the use of a spectral dissimilarity metric as a measure to characterize this mismatch; a detailed study of this dissimilarity metric is also presented. It is found that under favorable propagation conditions, for both actual channel measurement data and ray-tracing simulations, the directional and power properties of the downlink multipath clusters can be estimated from the uplink channel with high reliability. Therefore, directional-based beamforming transmission techniques for FDD systems will be able to benefit from such similarity in order to improve the system performance.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136154.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"176","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136154","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136154","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136154","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Uplink","Ray tracing","Antenna measurements","Array signal processing","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","frequency division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional reciprocity","downlink channels","uplink channels","frequency division duplex systems","FDD systems","multipath clusters","multipath components","spectral dissimilarity metric","channel measurement data","ray-tracing simulations","directional-based beamforming transmission techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multipath clusters","uplink downlink reciprocity","directional properties","mismatch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136154/","displayDocTitle":"On the directional reciprocity of uplink and downlink channels in Frequency Division Duplex systems","accessionNumber":"15242222","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7136154/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the directional reciprocity of uplink and downlink channels in Frequency Division Duplex systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p172imtiaz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052028S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7136157,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 300, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wen-Rong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280430600"},{"name":"Chun-Tao Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 300, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chun-Tao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404174400"},{"name":"Chia-Yu Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 300, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chia-Yu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085452024"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136157","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"Spatial modulation (SM) combined with spatial multiplexing is a newly developed transmission technique in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

As known, the ML detector can achieve optimum performance; however, its computational complexity may become prohibitively high when the dimension of MIMO system or symbol constellation is large. In this paper, we propose a new method to solve the problem. The main idea is to conduct a two-stage detection, antenna index and symbol. We develop a Gaussian approximation method such that the antenna-index can be first reliably detected. An enhanced method is also proposed so that the near-optimum performance can be obtained.

The channel state information (CSI) available is assumed to be imperfect under norm-bounded errors (NBE). Each transmitter is provided with a codebook of permutation matrices, so that each arrangement of permutation matrices among the K transmitters will generate a group of K parallel transceivers. The optimum transceiver group within the class of all possible such groups is chosen by a suitable selection mechanism for data transmission. To design each transceiver group, we adopt a worst-case design approach to minimize the maximum per user MSE. We show that the proposed transceiver design problem can be partitioned into an alternating sequence of optimization and worst-case analysis subproblems, which involves solving Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problems. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed SP-based transceiver is significantly better than existing methods in the presence of imperfect CSI.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1.</sup>","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136159","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136159.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"198","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Min-max MSE transceiver with switched preprocessing for MIMO interference channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Min-max MSE transceiver with switched preprocessing for MIMO interference channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136159/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257333","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136159/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Min-max MSE transceiver with switched preprocessing for MIMO interference channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p198zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068755S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136160,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Nevertheless, in the presence of imperfect CSI at BS, since RCI is more sensitive than CI to CSI imperfections, the performance of RCI becomes more degraded than that of CI. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive RCI technique which tries to compensate the degraded performance of standard RCI compared to CI when only imperfect CSI is available at BS. We do so by deriving an appropriate regularization parameter as a function of channel estimation error variance, which is possible to be known in advance. We also derive the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user and show that the adaptive RCI is a generalized version of standard RCI such that by setting the error variance equal to zero, the former boils down to the latter. Simulation results certify that the proposed scheme results in improved bit error rates (BER) and higher achievable sum rates compared to standard RCI.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Interference","Downlink","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","error statistics","multiuser channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","bit error rates","SINR","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","channel estimation error variance","CSI","regularized channel inversion","channel state information","multiuser multiantenna downlink","adaptive channel regularization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136160","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136160.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive channel regularization for multiuser multiantenna downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive channel regularization for multiuser multiantenna downlink","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136160/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136160/","accessionNumber":"15285126","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive channel regularization for multiuser multiantenna downlink","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p203razavi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07097S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136161,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyang Lei","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Ministry of Education, Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, China"],"firstName":"Mingyang","lastName":"Lei","id":"37085346272"},{"name":"Jianhua Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Ministry of Education, Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293674400"},{"name":"Tian Lei","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Ministry of Education, Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Lei","id":"37085349056"},{"name":"Detao Du","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Ministry of Education, Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, China"],"firstName":"Detao","lastName":"Du","id":"37085366632"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136161","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":548},"abstract":"In this paper, we present an indoor channel measurement system at 28 GHz and analysis result of propagation characteristics.

Measurement campaign was conducted in Beijing with three different indoor scenarios including office, corridor and hall. Power delay profiles (PDPs) are derived from raw data measured in four transmitter locations and 101 receiver locations. On this basis, three types of propagation characteristics including path loss, root mean square (RMS) delay spread and power angular profiles (PAPs) are analyzed. The results show that indoor environments can enhance received signal power in LOS case. However, in NLOS condition penetration loss caused by wall and door may bring considerable attenuation, which implies that smaller cells will play an important role on increasing the probabilities of LOS links for the future communication systems. Multipath components (MPCs) can be detected in several directions although using high-directional antennas.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Delays","Frequency

short-range multiple-input and multiple-output (SR-MIMO) transmission system that relies on line-of-sight (LOS) propagation, the channel matrix is determined by the antenna geometry, hence radio frequency (RF) signal processing by using an analog matrix circuit is a valid means of separating spatially-multiplexed multiple signal streams. To date several simple decoding methods utilizing this feature for SR-MIMO transmission have been proposed and demonstrated at one frequency point. This paper presents a demonstration of a simple decoding method for two-branch SR-MIMO transmission in a broadband with eight percent relative bandwidth, which corresponds to two-channel usage in the 60-GHz band. An experimental evaluation of the method was performed after prototyping the array antenna and weight matrix circuit. The evaluation results showed signal separation performance of 15 dB was obtained through the frequency range of 24.0-26.0 GHz. Bit error rate (BER) was simulated using measured transmission characteristics and we determined that 16 QAM signals at this band can be transmitted in the prototype system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance measurement of broadband simple decoding in short-range MIMO","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136162","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136162.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance measurement of broadband simple decoding in short-range MIMO","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136162/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257358","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance measurement of broadband simple decoding in short-range MIMO","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p213hiraga.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058848S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136164,"authors":[{"name":"Youngbin Chang","affiliation":["Communications Research Team, Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngbin","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279588000"},{"name":"Sangkyu Baek","affiliation":["Communications Research Team, Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangkyu","lastName":"Baek","id":"37085564203"},{"name":"Sooyoung Hur","affiliation":["Communications Research Team, Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sooyoung","lastName":"Hur","id":"38240511100"},{"name":"Youngjoong Mok","affiliation":["Communications Research Team, Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngjoong","lastName":"Mok","id":"37085546924"},{"name":"YoungJu Lee","affiliation":["Communications Research Team, Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"YoungJu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37697229000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136164","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":547},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Loss measurement","Ray tracing","Fading","Receivers","Three-dimensional displays","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre waves","mobile radio","ray tracing","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-slope mmwave channel model","urban environments","mobile traffic crunch","millimeter wave","radio channel characteristics","Ottawa","3D ray-tracing technique","radio channel model","dual-slope approach","nonline of sight","path loss model","single-slope path loss model","RMS errors","path loss observations","mmwave system"]}],"abstract":"To solve mobile traffic crunch, the usage of enormous bandwidth in millimeter wave (mm-Wave) is under discussion. In this paper, we investigate radio channel characteristics of mm-Wave frequency in the downtown area of Ottawa using 3D ray-tracing technique. In the results, important parameters of the radio channel model, such as path loss exponent, shadow fading, delay spread and angle spread, are provided. Especially, in case of path loss model in non-line of sight, a novel dual-slope approach is proposed for two conventional deployment scenarios. Comparing to traditional single-slope path loss model, the proposed method has smaller RMS errors in terms of local mean of path loss observations.

In this SDF protocol, the relay evaluates the reliabilities, expressed as log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), of the received signals from the two sources. The relay then forwards a network-coded combination of the parity symbols of both sources, but in the \u201csoft\u201d domain to avoid error propagation from the relay. We introduce a model for the effective noise experienced by the soft network coded symbols, constituting the new parameters of soft scalar and soft error; this model is then used to compute the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) at the destination. To facilitate this latter computation, we have derived an analytical expression for soft error variance, as well as a simplified expression based on a common assumption on the statistical behavior of the LLRs. This enables low-complexity computation and tracking of the soft error variance on-the-fly. The proposed system outperforms standard competing schemes reported in the literature in terms of error rate performance over Rayleigh fading links.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136170/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136170/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257440","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"LDPC coded soft forwarding with network coding for the two-way relay channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC coded soft forwarding with network coding for the two-way relay channel","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p253jayakody.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070769S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7136176,"authors":[{"name":"Yunchao Song","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Yunchao","lastName":"Song","id":"38240850500"},{"name":"Chen Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085521501"},{"name":"Feng Lu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Lu","id":"38238224100"},{"name":"Hua-An Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hua-An","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37276548600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136176","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Bit error rate","Detectors","Convex functions","Transmitting antennas","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved detection algorithm","lattice reduction","MIMO system","linear MIMO detection methods","LDs","LR-aided detection algorithms","near orthogonal matrix","symbol vector correlation","ILRA","polyhedron integer set","integer constraint","convex optimization problem","low-order QAM system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO detection","lattice reduction","feasible set","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"Lattice reduction (LR) is a powerful technique for improving the performance of linear MIMO detection methods. The efficient LR algorithms can largely improve the performance of the linear detectors (LDs). However, there are two problems involved in the LR-aided detection algorithms. One is that, the reduced basis is still not orthogonal, and most existing LR-aided algorithms devote to find a near orthogonal matrix. The other one is that the original constellation is no longer the feasible set of the detected symbol, and the elements of the new symbol vector are correlated. In this paper, an improved LR-aided algorithm (ILRA) considering the feasible set of the new symbol has been proposed. We verify that the feasible set is the integer set in a polyhedron. Eliminating the integer constraint, we simplify the detection to a convex optimization problem. Finally, we get the new detected symbol by solving the convex optimization problem. The simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over the previous LR-aided LDs, especially in the low-order QAM system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved detection algorithm based on Lattice reduction for MIMO system","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136176","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136176.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An improved detection algorithm based on Lattice reduction for MIMO system","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136176/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257516","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved detection algorithm based on Lattice reduction for MIMO system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p285song.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101201S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136179,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Haskou","affiliation":["Universite de Rennes 1, Rennes, Bretagne, FR"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Haskou"},{"name":"Philippe Mary","affiliation":["Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Rennes, Rennes, Bretagne, FR"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Mary"},{"name":"Maryline H\u00e9lard","affiliation":["Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Rennes, Rennes, Bretagne, FR"],"firstName":"Maryline","lastName":"H\u00e9lard"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136179","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Antenna arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors","Receiving antennas","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular momentum theory","AWGN channels","electromagnetic waves","fast Fourier transforms","maximum likelihood detection","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability","orbital angular momentum detection","OAM detection","electromagnetic radiation","EM radiation","phase gradient wavefront","multiple hypothesis testing problem","maximum likelihood test","additive white Gaussian noise channel","AWGN channel","fast Fourier transform","FFT","transmitter","receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orbital angular momentum","Maximum likelihood detection","FFT","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"The orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a physical property of an electromagnetic (EM) radiation, distinct from polarization, carrying a mechanical moment.

The OAM order detection problem is first presented as a multiple hypothesis testing problem. The maximum likelihood test leading to the error probability on the OAM order detection in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is derived when the transmitting and receiving arrays are perfectly aligned and misaligned.

On the other hand, circularly polarized (CP) terminals are more economical in manufacturing and installations as comparing to compatible LP terminals. The presented techniques will enable satellite operators to cost-effectively service Ku band VSAT users, either fixed or mobile, via LP space assets in Ku band. A method for grouping multiple LP satellite transponders through Wave-Front (WF) Multiplexing (muxing) techniques is presented. Grouped LP transponders become accessible efficiently by CP ground terminals and vice versa. This method consists of a polarization converting processor in a ground hub with our modifications of ground user equipment and satellite assets. In addition, applications of WF muxing techniques to satellite communications offer many advantages, including improved flexibility and utility efficiency of existing space assets.

Whereby beamforming (BF) can fully exploit the quasi-static spatial correlation to reduce dependence on the instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and simplify the complexity of signal process, but also incur a loss of system performance. In this paper, we analyze the potential of exploiting spatial correlation in FD-MIMO systems, and propose an interesting spatial-correlation-based partial-channel-aware beamforming (SP-BF) scheme. Through the rationale of Givens rotation, SP-BF leverages the CSIT of partial channels, i.e., reduced-dimension channel vector, to further boost the system performance achieved by exploiting the spatial correlation. By applying this scheme, FD-MIMO in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where no channel reciprocity could be exploited, can make a tradeoff between the system performance and the overhead of acquiring CSIT. In addition, we validate the proposed scheme by virtue of the Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136181","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136181.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"313","endPage":"317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel beamforming scheme in FD-MIMO systems with spatial correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel beamforming scheme in FD-MIMO systems with spatial correlation","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136181/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257423","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136181/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel beamforming scheme in FD-MIMO systems with spatial correlation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p313shao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05128S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136184,"authors":[{"name":"Yafei Hou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan","ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Hou","id":"38247496500"},{"name":"Satoshi Tsukamoto","affiliation":["ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Tsukamoto","id":"37394930400"},{"name":"Masayuki Ariyoshi","affiliation":["ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Ariyoshi","id":"37344261600"},{"name":"Kiyoshi Kobayashi","affiliation":["ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyoshi","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"38240230800"},{"name":"Minoru Okada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Okada","id":"37280788100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136184","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Receiving antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coaxial cables","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","single leaky coaxial cable","linear cells","LCX","linear service areas","radio communication systems","inside tunnels","multi-input multi-output system","RF transmit signals","MIMO channel","MIMO transmission"]}],"abstract":"Leaky coaxial cables (LCX) have been widely used as antennas to form linear service areas for radio communication systems. Such services of linear cells have been deployed inside tunnels, along railways, and so on. Usually, one LCX is utilized as one antenna. Therefore it requires more than one LCX to configure an multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. In this paper, we propose a MIMO system using single LCX, which can be utilized as two antennas. When different RF transmit signals are fed to each end of the proposed cable, single LCX can work as two antennas. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed MIMO system, we conduct experiments to measure the characteristics of 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO channel using single LCX. The results confirm that our proposed 2\u00d72 MIMO channel using single LCX can realize a good channel condition for MIMO transmission even within a highly correlated propagation condition. The proposed MIMO system using LCX will release the space requirement and reduce the cost of system for configuration of LCX MIMO system especially with large number of LCXs. It benefits the design and configuration of LCX-MIMO system for many scenarios of linear-cell.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136184","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136184.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2 by 2 MIMO system using single leaky coaxial cable for linear-cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136184/","displayDocTitle":"2 by 2 MIMO system using single leaky coaxial cable for linear-cells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257399","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136184/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2 by 2 MIMO system using single leaky coaxial cable for linear-cells","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p327hou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060602S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136186,"authors":[{"name":"Xian Liu","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering, University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR, USA"],"firstName":"Xian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085385731"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136186","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Gold","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Peak to average power ratio","Wireless communication","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["64-QAM class","low OFDM PMEPR bound","Golay complementary quad","peak-to-mean-envelope-power-ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Golay sequences","OFDM","PAPR","PMEPR"]}],"abstract":"It has been well known that the OFDM PMEPR of 64QAM is upper bounded by 4.66.

To combat this, we propose adaptive modulation schemes in which, depending on the humidity level of the channel and the distance between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), the system excludes some bands of the pulsed signal from the modulation scheme. Using FD-D64PSK modulation scheme and multiple transmitters in a time division multiplexing (TDM) channel, data rates as high as 5.994 Tbit/s can be achieved when the relative humidity (RH) is 0% over a distance of 50 cm.

This technique was shown to offer high energy efficiency and low system complexity thanks to the use of SM while achieving high data rates thanks to the use of AM. Motivated by this technique and the need of such performance in a cognitive radio (CR) scenario, we extend in this paper the concept of ASM to a spectrum sharing system. In this context, we propose the ASM-CR scheme as an energy-efficient, spectrally-efficient, and low-complexity scheme for CR systems. Compared to selected existing spectrum sharing schemes, ASM-CR is shown to offer a considerable ASE improvement while experiencing a slight degradation in the average bit error rate (ABER) performance. In order to address this, a hybrid scheme compromising between ASE and ABER is proposed. The performance of both proposed schemes is analyzed in terms of ASE and ABER and confirmed with selected numerical results using Monte-Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136189","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136189.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive spatial modulation for spectrally-efficient MIMO spectrum sharing systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136189/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive spatial modulation for spectrally-efficient MIMO spectrum sharing systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257515","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136189/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive spatial modulation for spectrally-efficient MIMO spectrum sharing systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p354bouida.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048144S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136191,"authors":[{"name":"Hanan Al-Tous","affiliation":["College of Engineering, UAE University, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Hanan","lastName":"Al-Tous","id":"38469509600"},{"name":"Imad Barhumi","affiliation":["College of Engineering, UAE University, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Imad","lastName":"Barhumi","id":"38480400700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136191","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Indexes","Throughput","Algorithm design and analysis","Cooperative communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auction framework","resource allocation","AF-OFDMA systems","relay nodes","subcarrier assignment profile","multiple users amplify and forward","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AF Cooperative Communications","OFDMA","Resource Allocation","Sequential Auction"]}],"abstract":"We develop an auction-based algorithm for joint allocation of resources, namely power profiles at the source and relay nodes and subcarrier assignment profile for multiple users amplify and forward (AF) orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system.

However, in time-frequency dispersive channels, the channels between the multiple access channel phase and broadcast channel phase become highly non-reciprocal, which significantly complicates the indispensable channel estimation for TWRNs employing coherent detection. In this paper, the challenging problem of channel estimation and data detection (CE-DD) is investigated for amplify-and-forward (AF) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based TWRNs over unknown non-reciprocal time-frequency dispersive channels. An independent CE-DD algorithm according to the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion is firstly proposed. To further improve system performance, an iterative joint CE-DD algorithm employing the variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework is then developed. Simulation results show that initialized by the proposed MMSE-based algorithm, the proposed VBI-based iterative algorithm converges in a few iterations and after convergence, its performance approaches the ideal case which supposes perfect knowledge of channel state informations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136192/","accessionNumber":"15257429","displayDocTitle":"On MMSE and VBI detection for TWRNs over unknown non-reciprocal time-frequency dispersive channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On MMSE and VBI detection for TWRNs over unknown non-reciprocal time-frequency dispersive channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p370zhong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103732S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7136195,"authors":[{"name":"Ilmiawan Shubhi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Ilmiawan","lastName":"Shubhi","id":"37085568120"},{"name":"Yukitoshi Sanada","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukitoshi","lastName":"Sanada","id":"37269451300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136195","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Joints","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Turbo codes","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","forward error correction","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo codes","overloaded MIMO-OFDM systems","joint decoding","data rate communications","third generation partnership project","3GPP","long term evolution","LTE","forward error correcting standard","FEC standard","receive antennas","joint decoding scheme","joint turbo decoding","bit combinations","super trellis diagram","MIMO capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Overloaded MIMO-OFDM","Turbo Codes","Joint Decoding","Joint Turbo Decoding","Spatial Multiplexing Modulation"]}],"abstract":"In order to support high data rate communications, the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) implements multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In addition, to achieve excellent performance, LTE also employs turbo codes as the forward error correcting (FEC) standard. Although conventional turbo codes give satisfactory performance in the ideal MIMO, significant performance degradation occurs in an overloaded MIMO system when the number of transmit antennas is larger than the number of receive antennas. This paper proposes a joint decoding scheme for turbo codes in overloaded MIMO-OFDM systems. In joint turbo decoding, the calculations of soft information are based on the bit combinations from all of streams. In addition, a super-trellis diagram is used to combine the trellis diagrams.

While maximization of minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is the antenna selection metric, power minimization subject to SINR constraint is the power control problem used in the proposed schemes. It is shown that the proposed algorithms improve the BER of the system with acceptable sum-rate and fairness achieved in the system. Prioritization of streams can improve the BER of the system such as by assigning higher priorities to more important streams.

The proposed WUCFS is used to activate mobile subscribers by evaluating the correlation between the candidate and the selected users as well as those who may be scheduled for data transmission. Weighted inverse-correlation maximization is then employed to determine which users to be scheduled for data transmission. By estimating potential co-channel interference (CCI) a priori, our algorithm can accurately estimate the actual transmission rate of each mobile user, and fairly activate a set of users with small mutual interference.

A transmission block is divided into training and data transmission phases. The channel estimation at the receiver is noisy. The transmitter has long term statistics of the estimated channel in the form of a covariance matrix. The general problem is to find optimum transmit covariance matrix under these channel state information (CSI) assumptions. Beamforming strategy is optimum when the optimum transmit covariance matrix is unit rank. Previous works find conditions under which beamforming is optimal when the receiver has instantaneous and full CSI. Here, we consider noisy CSI at the receiver and introduce a condition over channel covariance matrix, block length and the transmit power constraint, where beamforming is always the optimum transmission strategy. We show through simulations that beamforming is optimal for a larger set of parameters when block duration is short and when SNR is low. An interesting result we observe through simulations is that beamforming is always optimal when transmission block is at most three symbols long. This means that when block fading becomes faster, beamforming becomes optimal almost always regardless of number of antennas or other parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimality of beamforming in fading MIMO with noisy channel estimation","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136202","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136202.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimality of beamforming in fading MIMO with noisy channel estimation","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136202/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15242216","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimality of beamforming in fading MIMO with noisy channel estimation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p423soysal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037838S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136203,"authors":[{"name":"Bang Chul Jung","affiliation":["Dept. of ICE, Gyeongsang National Univ., Tongyeong, Korea"],"firstName":"Bang Chul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37289794700"},{"name":"Su Min Kim","affiliation":["KTH, School of EE, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Su Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291927600"},{"name":"Hyun Jong Yang","affiliation":["UNIST, School of ECE, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun Jong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085350182"},{"name":"Won-Yong Shin","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, Dankook Univ., Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Yong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37535066000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136203","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"abstract":"Due to the difficulty of coordination in cellular uplink networks, it is a practical challenge to achieve better throuhgput with a distributed scheduling. Futhermore, multiple antennas at mobile stations (MSs) can be utilized for reducing interference or for improving the desired signal strength. In this paper, we investigate a joint design of beamforming and user scheduling for multi-cell multiple input multiple output (MIMO) uplink networks. In the proposed scheme, each BS with M antennas adopts M random beamforming techniques and each MS with L antennas utilizes a single beamforming vector which minimizes the sum power of generating interferences to home cell as well as other cells. In each cell, then, the BS selects M MSs such that both sufficiently large desired signal power and sufficiently small generating interference are guaranteed. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing distributed schemes in terms of sum-rate in practical environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136203.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the joint design of beamforming and user scheduling in multi-cell MIMO uplink networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Uplink","Antennas","Multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","distributed algorithms","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user scheduling","multicell MIMO uplink networks","cellular uplink networks","signal strength","multicell multiple input multiple output uplink networks","random beamforming techniques","single beamforming vector","generating interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO interfering multiple access channel","multiuser diversity","beamforming","user scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the joint design of beamforming and user scheduling in multi-cell MIMO uplink networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136203/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15272542","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the joint design of beamforming and user scheduling in multi-cell MIMO uplink networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p428jung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067874S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136204,"authors":[{"name":"Huiqin Du","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huiqin","lastName":"Du","id":"37708277700"},{"name":"Tharm Ratnarajah","affiliation":["IDCoM, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K."],"firstName":"Tharm","lastName":"Ratnarajah","id":"37065840000"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, U.K."],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37285072400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136204","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"abstract":"Interference alignment (IA) is a transmission technique for exploiting all available degrees of freedom (DoF) in the frequency- or time-selective interference channel with an arbitrary number of users, which can achieve linear capacity scaling with number of users. However, standard IA approach has limit performance in the low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. Recently, linear combination designs have been proposed to improve performance of sum rate at finite SNR which jointly considers the interference and the signal optimization simultaneously, but is sensitive to the weight selection. Therefore, it motivates us to propose a normal-boundary intersection (NBI)-based design that jointly optimizes the rank of interference and its power with evenly spread parameters. The underlying problem is transferred into limited subproblem that can be efficiently solved. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm that achieves the Pareto optimality and provides evenly-distributed Pareto frontiers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136204.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pareto optimization for MIMO interference channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Minimization","MIMO","Interference channels","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","Pareto optimisation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimization","MIMO interference channel","interference alignment","IA","degree-of-freedom","DoF","frequency-selective interference channel","time-selective interference channel","linear capacity scaling","standard IA approach","low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio region","low-to-moderate SNR region","linear combination designs","finite SNR","signal optimization","weight selection","normal-boundary intersection-based design","NBI-based design","evenly-distributed Pareto frontiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Pareto optimization for MIMO interference channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136204/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257295","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto optimization for MIMO interference channel","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p433du.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052835S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136205,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zeng","affiliation":["A*STAR, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37271453200"},{"name":"Meng Wan Chia","affiliation":["A*STAR, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Meng Wan","lastName":"Chia","id":"37404449000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136205","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136205","abstract":"Preamble with repeated time domain blocks is a very common design for joint time and frequency synchronization in various communication systems and standards. While it is easy to design two or more repeated time domain blocks in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and some other systems, it is not straightforward to design filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) signal that has the repetition property in time domain, as FBMC modulation spreads one block of frequency domain signal into multiple blocks in time domain. In this paper, a new design is proposed for constructing repeated time domain blocks in FBMC.

All derived analytical results are corroborated by simulation results to show the correctness of our derived results.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136213","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136213.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"480","endPage":"485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage probability of multihop MIMO networks with transmit antenna selection (TAS) in a poisson field of interferes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage probability of multihop MIMO networks with transmit antenna selection (TAS) in a poisson field of interferes","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136213/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257390","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136213/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probability of multihop MIMO networks with transmit antenna selection (TAS) in a poisson field of interferes","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p480abdelnabi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075377S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136215,"authors":[{"name":"Tengteng Lian","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

Unlike the conventional pilot reuse scheme which allows pilots to be reused only among different cells, CPR allows inter- and/or intra-cell user equipments to reuse the same pilots, efficiently reducing the pilot overhead. For the spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels, we first present the CPR-based channel estimation and a greedy pilot allocation algorithm. With the channel estimation errors due to CPR taken into account, we then develop a statistically robust transceiver which can guarantee the transmission performance. Monte-Carlo simulations show that compared to the conventional multi-cell pilot reuse scheme, the proposed CPR scheme provides significant performance gains in terms of the net spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136215","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136215.pdf","startPage":"492","endPage":"496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated pilot reuse for multi-cell massive MIMO transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136215/","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated pilot reuse for multi-cell massive MIMO transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257475","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136215/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated pilot reuse for multi-cell massive MIMO transmission","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p492lian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060356S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136216,"authors":[{"name":"Sudip Biswas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Sudip","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37085496487"},{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Masouros","id":"37299872300"},{"name":"Tharmalingam Ratnarajah","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Tharmalingam","lastName":"Ratnarajah","id":"37284633900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136216","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Couplings","Mutual coupling","Receiving antennas","Dipole antennas","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","energy conservation","MIMO communication","power consumption","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna correlation effect","energy efficiency","massive MIMO systems","massive multiple-input-multiple-output systems","BS physical space","critical antenna spacing","power consumption model","circuit power consumptions","quasiconcave function","detection technique"]}],"abstract":"Massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems deploying a large number of antennas at the base station (BS) have been shown to produce high spectral and energy efficiencies (EE) under the assumptions of increasing BS physical space and critical antenna spacing. We propose a more realistic system model considering a fixed physical space: incorporating coupling and correlation among the BS antennas while providing a realistic analysis of the power consumption using a new power consumption model, taking into account the circuit power consumptions as a function of the number of BS antennas. We also touch on the performance analysis of two practical low complexity detectors keeping EE into consideration. The simulation results obtained show that EE does not monotonically increase with the number of BS antennas. On the contrary, it is a decreasing concave or quasi concave function of the number of BS antennas depending on the detection technique used at the receiver. Also shown is that with decreasing spacing between the antennas, mutual coupling increases contributing towards reduction in EE. Our analysis thus shows that EE does not increase in a massive MIMO system when a large number of antennas are to be accommodated within a fixed physical space and the total power consumed is considered to be a function of the antennas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the effect of antenna correlation and coupling on energy-efficiency of massive MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136216","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136216.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the effect of antenna correlation and coupling on energy-efficiency of massive MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136216/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15285130","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the effect of antenna correlation and coupling on energy-efficiency of massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p497biswas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069563S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136217,"authors":[{"name":"Frederick W.

In these systems, a relatively large number of antennas are connected to a less number of analog front-end chains so as to reduce both of the hardware complexity and power consumption. This paper investigates on optimizing phase-only analog BF and digital BF weights, with the objective of minimizing the total transmit power subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. An floating-point genetic algorithm, in which the fitness function is defined as the linear scale of the objective function, is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Chaos crossover probability, chaos mutation probability and elitist strategy are introduced into the genetic algorithm in purpose of improving the operating efficiency as well as increasing the convergent rate. Simulations results under Gaussian channel environment reveal the advantages of the proposed genetic algorithm over the existed iterative algorithm. Besides, under 60GHz channel model, it is shown that the correlation on different subcarriers has profound impact on the performance of hybrid phase-only analog/digital BF.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136220","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136220.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser hybrid phase-only analog/digital beamforming with genetic algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136220/","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser hybrid phase-only analog/digital beamforming with genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257346","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136220/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser hybrid phase-only analog/digital beamforming with genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p517hong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049742S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136221,"authors":[{"name":"Cen Lin","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Cen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085437849"},{"name":"Geoffrey Ye Li","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"38516728900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136221","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136221","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing","Complexity theory","Bandwidth","Arrays","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","greedy algorithms","indoor radio","multiuser channels","submillimetre wave antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance-aware multicarrier indoor terahertz communications","THz communication system","distance-frequency dependent peculiarity","THz channels","distance-aware multicarrier transmission scheme","hybrid beamforming","low complexity greedy subarray selection algorithm","antenna subarray selection algorithm","multiuser THz system","transmission policy effectiveness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136221","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136221.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance-aware multi-carrier indoor terahertz communications with antenna array selection","abstract":"In this paper, we study a multiuser indoor Terahertz (THz) communication system with antenna array.

However, to harness the full capabilities of multiuser multiantenna downlink, the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI) at base station (BS) is mandatory. Since from the practical point of view, this is an optimistic assumption, in this paper, we evaluate the asymptotic performance of CI under a generalized CSI mismatch model where the variance of the channel estimation error depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this case, we quantify novel bounds regarding the asymptotic mean loss in sum rate and achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) by deriving the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user. It is shown that, for example, the achievable DoF is directly related to the SNR exponent of the channel estimation error variance. In other words, if the intention is to keep the asymptotic mean loss in sum rate bounded, the variance of the channel estimation error must at least scale with the inverse of SNR. Also an asymptotic gap to capacity for analog feedback is derived.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7136226/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257384","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic performance analysis of channel inversion under CSI imperfections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic performance analysis of channel inversion under CSI imperfections","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p550razavi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076426S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136228,"authors":[{"name":"Linyun Wu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Linyun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085465000"},{"name":"Jianhua Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293674400"},{"name":"Yanliang Sun","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Yanliang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085471474"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136228","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Quantization (signal)","Power control","Downlink","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","competitive algorithms","distributed algorithms","feedback","game theory","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","optimisation","power control","precoding","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","limited feedback precoding","SINR","optimal capacity analysis","MIMO downlink broadcast channel","imperfect channel state information at the transmitter","CSIT","optimization","competitive PC scheme","distributed PC scheme","interference-limited network","Nash equilibrium","sum capacity","SC","Monte Carlo simulation","nonlinear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","THP","equal power allocation","EP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136228","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136228.pdf","startPage":"560","endPage":"564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control for limited feedback precoding: Achievable SINRs and optimal capacity analysis","abstract":"This paper analyzes the performance of MIMO downlink broadcast channel employing precoding techniques, with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) due to limited feedback. We focus on two optimization issues that related to power control (PC) in precoding. Firstly we employ a distributed and competitive PC scheme for the interference-limited network, and derive two sufficient conditions of Nash Equilibrium, which are the upper bounds for achievable SINRs. Secondly, maximum sum capacity (SC) is investigated to show the maximal ability of PC in precoding. From Monte-Carlo simulation, it reveals that the capacity boost of non-linear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) with PC is significant as compared to its alternatives. Specially, the more users are served, the higher capacity gain is achieved. Maximally about 0.9 bps/Hz capacity gain can be achieved for THP, which is about 10.8% better than equal power allocation (EP).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7136228/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15272574","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power control for limited feedback precoding: Achievable SINRs and optimal capacity analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control for limited feedback precoding: Achievable SINRs and optimal capacity analysis","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p560wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081633S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7136233,"authors":[{"name":"Dzevdan Kapetanovic","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Dzevdan","lastName":"Kapetanovic","id":"37887626700"},{"name":"Azzam Al-Nahari","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Ibb university, Ibb, Yemen"],"firstName":"Azzam","lastName":"Al-Nahari","id":"38276024700"},{"name":"Aleksandar Stojanovic","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Stojanovic","id":"37398373800"},{"name":"Fredrik Rusek","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Rusek","id":"37283101000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136233","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":578},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Gaussian approximation","Security","Physical layer","Noise","Training","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active eavesdropper detection","massive MIMO system physical layer security","TDD mode","base station","time division duplex mode"]}],"abstract":"We consider physical layer security of massive MIMO systems in TDD mode.

Asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions are derived when the number of antennas at the relay is substantially higher than the number of user nodes. These asymptotic SINRs are independent of the fast fading component of the wireless channel, and hence, the latency in the air interface due to fast fading can be reduced. The transmit power at each user node and/or relay can be scaled down inversely proportional to the number of antennas at the relay without degrading the system performance. The asymptotic SINR expressions are then used to derive asymptotic spectral and energy efficiencies of AF MWRNs with symmetric and asymmetric data traffic. These spectral and energy efficiency results show that MWRNs with massive MIMO achieve substantial multiplexing gains while allowing the transmit powers of user nodes to become infinitesimal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-way amplify-and-forward relay networks with massive MIMO","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136235","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136235.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multi-way amplify-and-forward relay networks with massive MIMO","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136235/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257443","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-way amplify-and-forward relay networks with massive MIMO","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p595amarasuriya.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071438S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136237,"authors":[{"name":"Tatsunori Obara","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsunori","lastName":"Obara","id":"37972191100"},{"name":"Satoshi Suyama","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Suyama","id":"37297955700"},{"name":"Jiyun Shen","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Jiyun","lastName":"Shen","id":"37537782000"},{"name":"Yukihiko Okumura","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiko","lastName":"Okumura","id":"37355635900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136237","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":780},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Transmission line matrix methods","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","array signal processing","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FBCP","CSI","eigenmode precoding matrix","joint fixed BF and CSI-based precodin scheme","digital precoder design","codebook-based precoding","massive MIMO transceiver","massive MIMO beamforming","5G mobile communication system","5th generation mobile communication system","higher frequency bands","super high bit rate 5G massive MIMO systems","joint fixed beamforming and eigenmode precoding","bit rate 20 Gbit/s","frequency 20 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","higher frequency bands","Massive MIMO","analog fixed beamforming","eigenmode precoding"]}],"abstract":"In order to tackle rapidly increasing traffic, the 5th generation (5G) mobile communication system will introduce small cells using higher frequency bands with wider bandwidth to achieve super high bit rate transmission of several tens Gbps. Massive MIMO beamforming (BF) is one of promising technologies to compensate for larger path-loss in the higher frequency bands. Joint analog fixed BF and digital precoding has been proposed to reduce the cost of a Massive MIMO transceiver. However, the conventional scheme assumes the transmission of a few streams using well-known codebook-based precoding as the digital precoding, and both a selection method of the fixed BF weights and a digital precoder design, which are suitable for the super high bit rate transmission using multiple streams, have not been studied. This paper proposes a joint fixed BF and CSI-based precoding (called FBCP) scheme for the 5G Massive MIMO systems. FBCP first selects the analog fixed BF weights based on maximum total received power criterion, and then it calculates eigenmode (EM) precoding matrix exploiting CSI. This paper targets a 5G system achieving 20 Gbps in 20 GHz band as one example, and throughput performances of the proposed FBCP are evaluated by link level simulation and compared with those of the fixed BF and those of the EM precoding.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136237","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136237.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint fixed beamforming and eigenmode precoding for super high bit rate massive MIMO systems using higher frequency bands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136237/","displayDocTitle":"Joint fixed beamforming and eigenmode precoding for super high bit rate massive MIMO systems using higher frequency bands","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257462","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136237/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint fixed beamforming and eigenmode precoding for super high bit rate massive MIMO systems using higher frequency bands","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p607obara.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056831S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136242,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, by using interference alignment (IA) the achievable DoF can be linearly scaled up with the number of users. Nevertheless, this outperformance of IA heavily depends on the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI), which is not a realistic assumption in practice. Since under imperfect CSI, the performance of IA may become severely degraded, design of enhanced IA algorithms by relying on the availability of merely imperfect CSI is of particular interest. In this paper, we propose a least squares (LS)-based IA algorithm which adaptively designs the beamformers based on the knowledge of the channel estimation error variance, which is possible to be known in advance. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with interference leakage minimization algorithms. It is shown that under both perfect and imperfect CSI, the proposed LS-based IA outperforms interference leakage minimization algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136242","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"633","endPage":"637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive LS-based beamformer design for multiuser MIMO interference channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive LS-based beamformer design for multiuser MIMO interference channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136242/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257327","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136242/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive LS-based beamformer design for multiuser MIMO interference channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p633razavi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061229S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136243,"authors":[{"name":"Yingqi Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Yingqi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085445072"},{"name":"Donglin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Donglin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085439556"},{"name":"Michel Fattouche","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Fattouche","id":"37332307700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136243","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136243","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Adaptation models","DH-HEMTs","Cognitive radio","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive radio","spectrum utilization","adaptive spectrum sensing and transmission","bit error rate","primary user","adaptive window","BER variation","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CR","spectrum utilization","adaptive","BER"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136243","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136243.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel spectrum sensing scheme in cognitive radio by simultaneously sensing/transmitting at full-duplex Tx and BER measurements at Rx","abstract":"This paper considers spectrum utilization in cognitive radio (CR) based on both simultaneously adaptive spectrum sensing and transmission at Tx and bit error rate (BER) variation checking at Rx.

Simulation results show that i) the probability of detection when SU does not transmit is slightly higher than that when SU transmits, ii) the adaptive window improves the spectrum utilization, and iii) the observation on BER provides a significant improvement on the spectrum utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136243/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15257416","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136243/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Novel spectrum sensing scheme in cognitive radio by simultaneously sensing/transmitting at full-duplex Tx and BER measurements at Rx","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel spectrum sensing scheme in cognitive radio by simultaneously sensing/transmitting at full-duplex Tx and BER measurements at Rx","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p638lu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05808S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136244,"authors":[{"name":"Eleftherios Chatziantoniou","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Research, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Eleftherios","lastName":"Chatziantoniou","id":"37085531233"},{"name":"Ben Allen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Research, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Allen","id":"37274755600"},{"name":"Vladan Velisavljevi\u0107","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Research, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Vladan","lastName":"Velisavljevi\u0107","id":"37295040500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136244","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","GSM","Cognitive radio","Approximation methods","Probability","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cognitive radio","Gaussian processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["empirical polarization domain channel availability model","dynamic spectrum access networks","cognitive radio terminals monitor","spectral environment","frequency channels","spectrum occupancy","channel availability","novel probabilistic channel availability model","mobile cognitive radio terminals","Gaussian approximation","cellular frequency bands"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel availability","cognitive radio","idleness probability","spectrum activity measurements"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical polarization domain channel availability model for cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","endPage":"647","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136244","startPage":"643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136244","abstract":"In dynamic spectrum access networks, cognitive radio terminals monitor their spectral environment in order to detect and opportunistically access unoccupied frequency channels.

In this paper we propose a novel framework where the PBS utilizes its excess available power to charge a ST so as to enable it to share its spectrum. In this framework, the PBS employs beamforming to facilitate energy harvesting by a selected ST in the first hop while forwarding information to the relay. In the second hop, while the relay communicates to PR, the selected ST employs dynamic spectrum access (DSA) to communicate to its SBS. Such a framework can be expected to help the primary network earn revenue for both energy transfer and spectrum sharing. Assuming peak interference power constraints, we derive an expression for the outage probability of the secondary link. We also derive a simple expression for the outage floor. A simple intuitive user-selection scheme is suggested. It is shown that secondary user-selection can greatly enhance performance.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136245","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal,

Simulation results show that the extended 4-point approximation based detector is able to provide nearly optimal performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended 4-point approximation of the optimal QAM modulation detector","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136263","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136263.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Extended 4-point approximation of the optimal QAM modulation detector","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136263/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15242214","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended 4-point approximation of the optimal QAM modulation detector","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p743chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060587S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136264,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaomei Lu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Xiaomei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085424118"},{"name":"Wenjun Xu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404292300"},{"name":"Shengyu Li","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Shengyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37071823500"},{"name":"Zhihui Liu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Zhihui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085419587"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404490700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136264","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"abstract":"Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), which processes information and scavenges energy from the same ambient radio frequency signals, has recently drawn significant attention. In addition, the integration of cognitive radio and two-way relay transmission has emerged as a promising approach for improving spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider a cognitive two-way relaying network, where the SWIPT-enabled-relay helps two secondary nodes exchange information with the energy harvested from the received signals. The rate maximization problem for the relaying network is formulated under the constraint that interference to the primary user resulting from the transmission of the secondary relaying network cannot exceed the threshold. Based on the mathematical analysis of the problem, we propose a suboptimal joint relay selection and power allocation scheme with the Bisection Search method. Numerical simulations confirm the near-optimality of the proposed scheme by comparing with the optimal solution. Specially, the best two-way relay location is also revealed in simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136264.pdf","startPage":"748","endPage":"752","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer for cognitive two-way relaying networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Wireless communication","Search methods","Interference constraints","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy harvesting","radiofrequency interference","radiofrequency power transmission","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bisection search method","power allocation scheme","suboptimal joint relay selection","mathematical analysis","rate maximization problem","spectral efficiency","ambient radio frequency signals","SWIPT","cognitive two-way relaying networks","power transfer","simultaneous wireless information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer for cognitive two-way relaying networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15285133","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer for cognitive two-way relaying networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p748lu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073388S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136265,"authors":[{"name":"Farrukh A.

A software-defined radio (SDR) platform is used to experimentally evaluate the detection performance of these algorithms. It is observed that MFM, which uses four signal features extracted across space, time and phase dimensions, provides the best performance among the considered algorithms. This paper also presents a new idea on the use of eigenvectors for signal classification in multiple antenna systems. Using computer simulations, it is shown that eigenvectors corresponding to different modulation schemes allow for reliable signal identification even at very low SNR values (on the order of -20 dB), therefore they can be used effectively for signal classification in cognitive radio applications.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136265","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136265.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136265","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","startPage":"753","endPage":"757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of eigenvectors for signal detection and classification in multiple antenna cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the use of eigenvectors for signal detection and classification in multiple antenna cognitive radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136265/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136265/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257549","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of eigenvectors for signal detection and classification in multiple antenna cognitive radios","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p753bhatti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054325S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7136266,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Endo","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Endo","id":"37085466483"},{"name":"Tomoaki Ohtsuki","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Ohtsuki","id":"37268988400"},{"name":"Takeo Fujii","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center (AWCC), The University of Electro-Communications, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37277000800"},{"name":"Osamu Takyu","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Shinshu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Takyu","id":"37284749500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136266","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Capacity planning","Security","Transmitters","Cooperative communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","probability","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary transmit beamformings","spectrum leasing","CRN","cognitive radio models","eavesdropper","primary user","secondary user","cooperative communication","primary secure communications","interference","secondary cooperation","channel state information","primary secrecy capacity","primary secrecy capacity outage probability","secondary sum throughput","primary throughput"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136266","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136266","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","abstract":"Spectrum leasing is one of the cognitive radio models, where a primary user leases its spectrum resources for secondary user in exchange for cooperation.

Therefore, we focus on cooperative communications where secondary users use orthogonal BFs that do not affect primary user. We consider the effects of secondary cooperation and the knowledge of eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) on the cooperative communications.

Different ET implementation solutions, especially the way of choosing shaping table, have a great impact on the performance of ET system. In this paper, a transistor-level PA and a behavior-level supply modulator are introduced to analyze the performance of ET PA system. The power-added efficiency (PAE), AM-to-AM distortion, AM-to-PM distortion and Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) are investigated to explain the impacts of different commonly-used shaping methods. Simulation results indicate that adopting ET technology increases the efficiency of RF PA largely, and the shaping methods applied in supply modulation will affect a lot in efficiency and linearity. Consequently, a new dualmode ET shaping method is proposed in this paper to guarantee high efficiency as far as possible without introducing too much distortions. Besides, it also improves the linearity where the PAE is at a lower level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7136268/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257560","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of envelope tracking power amplifier's envelope shaping methods for LTE mobile terminal application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of envelope tracking power amplifier's envelope shaping methods for LTE mobile terminal application","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p768wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055721S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7136271,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Singhal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Singhal","id":"37085373601"},{"name":"Ranjan K.

In this paper we propose to employ a variant of the simplex algorithm for LP decoding, called the dual simplex algorithm. This algorithm has two advantages: It inherently uses the received LLRs to generate a close to optimum starting solution and it allows to reuse former LP solutions if an adaptive LP decoding scheme is used. It is shown, that the dual simplex algorithm outperforms the standard (primal) simplex by a factor of 15-20 in runtime. This allows for efficient future hardware implementations. Furthermore the use of fixed-point instead of floating-point numbers is investigated to further reduce hardware complexity.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136272","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136272.pdf","startPage":"790","endPage":"794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplex algorithm for LP decoding hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A simplex algorithm for LP decoding hardware","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136272/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257265","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136272/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplex algorithm for LP decoding hardware","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p790gensheimer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070374S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7136273,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Lung Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 300, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Sheng-Lung","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085387620"},{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 300, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wen-Rong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280430600"},{"name":"Ying-Pei Hsu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 300, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Ying-Pei","lastName":"Hsu","id":"38520561600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136273","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Interference","Peak to average power ratio","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","OFDM modulation","power combiners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-forcing equalizer enhancement","combinerless LINC-OFDM systems","peak-to-average power ratio problem","linear-amplification-with-nonlinear-component technique","constant-envelop component signals","nonlinear amplifiers","power combiner","component signals","self-interference reduction","closed-form expression","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear-amplification-with-nonlinear-component (LINC)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio(PAPR)"]}],"abstract":"The energy efficiency of OFDM systems is known to be low due to the high peak-to-average power ratio problem. The linear-amplification-with-nonlinear-component (LINC) technique can solve the problem by decomposing the input signal into two constant-envelop component signals and applying high-efficient nonlinear amplifiers. However, the power combiner, a key component used to combine the amplified signals, is difficult to implement. Combinerless LINC systems employ two transmit antennas such that two component signals can be naturally combined at the receiver. Unfortunately, the performance of combinerless LINC-OFDM systems is seriously degraded if difference exists, even small, between the two channels that the two component signals propagate. In this paper, we propose an enhanced zero-forcing equalizer to solve this problem. The main idea is to reduce a self-interference induced by the channel difference. A closed-form expression for the optimum parameter of the proposed equalizer is also derived. Simulations show that the proposed equalizer can effectively enhance the performance of combinerless LINC-OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136273","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136273.pdf","startPage":"795","endPage":"799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced zero-forcing equalizer for combinerless LINC-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136273/","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced zero-forcing equalizer for combinerless LINC-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257414","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136273/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced zero-forcing equalizer for combinerless LINC-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p795cheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074143S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136276,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Gotthans","affiliation":["Department of Radio Electronics, BUT, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Gotthans","id":"37704291000"},{"name":"Genevi\u00e8ve Baudoin","affiliation":["ESYCOM (EA2552), ESIEE Paris, Noisy Le Grand, France"],"firstName":"Genevi\u00e8ve","lastName":"Baudoin","id":"37277494700"},{"name":"Amadou Mbaye","affiliation":["ESYCOM (EA2552), ESIEE Paris, Noisy Le Grand, France"],"firstName":"Amadou","lastName":"Mbaye","id":"38467643600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136276","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":669},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Predistortion","Peak to average power ratio","Neurons","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential amplifiers","distortion","feedforward neural nets","linearisation techniques","MOSFET","OFDM modulation","polynomials","power amplifiers","signal processing","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital predistortion","advance neural network","delay neural network","Volterra derived model","NNET","power amplifier linearization","feedforward tapped delay line neural network","complex signal","TADNN predistorter","tapped advance and delay line neural net","DPD","memory polynomial","dynamic deviation reduction model","peak to average power ratio","PAPR","LDMOS","laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor","push-pull power amplifier","OFDM","orthogonal frequency-division multiplex signal","carrier frequency","Volterra series","bandwidth 16 MHz","frequency 200 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PAPR reduction","Linearization","predistortion","power amplifier","neural network","delay","advance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136276","abstract":"This paper is focused on digital predistortion using neural networks (NNETs) for linearization of power amplifiers.

We name this architecture TADNN (tapped advance and delay line neural net). We show that the introduction of advance taps improves the digital predistortion (DPD) performance. We also compare the TADNN predistorter with predistorters derived from Volterra series such as memory polynomial or dynamic deviation reduction models. This comparison is based on three elements: performance in linearization, complexity, increase of the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) by the predistorter. Indeed, one drawback of Volterra based predistorters is that they can generate predistorted signals with very high PAPR that cannot be applied directly at the input of the power amplifier. Conversely, the PAPR of the predistorted signals at the output of the TADNN remains moderate. The presented approach is evaluated on a real LDMOS (laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor) push-pull power amplifier with 16 MHz bandwidth OFDM (orthogonal frequency-division multiplex) signal at a carrier frequency of 200 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136276","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136276.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"815","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital predistortion with advance/delay neural network and comparison with Volterra derived models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Digital predistortion with advance/delay neural network and comparison with Volterra derived models","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15257478","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7136276/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital predistortion with advance/delay neural network and comparison with Volterra derived models","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p811gotthans.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084135S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7136280,"authors":[{"name":"Paula Aquilina","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Paula","lastName":"Aquilina","id":"37085376484"},{"name":"Tharmalingam Ratnarajah","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Tharmalingam","lastName":"Ratnarajah","id":"37284633900"},{"name":"Anastasios Papazafeiropoulos","affiliation":["Communications and Signal Processing Group, Imperial College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Papazafeiropoulos","id":"37085394520"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136280","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Integrated circuits","Interference","Time division multiple access","Signal to noise ratio","Mathematical model","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DoF region","sum rate analysis","K user MIMO IC","limited CSI feedback","multiple-input multiple-output interference channel","limited channel state information feedback","degrees-of-freedom performance","space-time interference alignment algorithms","STIA algorithms","transmit power constraint","sum rate achievable"]}],"abstract":"In this work we investigate the degrees of freedom (DoF) performance of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel (IC) with limited channel state information (CSI) feedback.

CM-reduction methods with distortion can efficiently limit CM while causing in-band distortion and out-of-band radiation. In this paper, the tradeoff among CM-reduction, in-band distortion and out-of-band radiation is formulated as an optimization problem, where the error vector magnitude (EVM) is minimized subject to the allowed CM and out-of-band radiation constraints. Although this optimization problem is nonconvex, our analysis shows that after modifications it can be transformed into a convex problem, which can be solved effectively.

In this paper, a practical and suitable digital I/Q imbalance estimation and compensation method for mitigating the I/Q imbalance in this flexible radio transceivers is developed and evaluated.

The ADS-Matlab co-simulation results show that the developed digital compensation method can significantly reduce the impact of the I/Q imbalance on the Full-Duplex Dual-Band OFDM radio receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital estimation and compensation of I/Q imbalance for full-duplex dual-band OFDM radio","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136283","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136283.pdf","startPage":"846","endPage":"850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Digital estimation and compensation of I/Q imbalance for full-duplex dual-band OFDM radio","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136283/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15272541","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital estimation and compensation of I/Q imbalance for full-duplex dual-band OFDM radio","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p846zhan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073616S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136284,"authors":[{"name":"Hany Elgala","affiliation":["NSF Smart Lighting ERC, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Elgala","id":"37396369500"},{"name":"Thomas D.

We propose a novel real-valued unipolar version of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) that is suitable for direct intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) optical wireless systems including VLC. Without additional forms of interference estimation and cancelation to recover the symbols, the Spectral and Energy Efficient OFDM (SEE-OFDM) almost doubles the spectral efficiency of unipolar optical OFDM formats. In our scheme, multiple signals are generated and added/transmitted together, where both odd and even indexed subcarriers of the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operation carry data and are not affected by any kind of interference, (e.g., clipping). Monte Carlo simulations under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) show gains of up to 6dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the conventional energy-efficient asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM). Moreover, a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction of 2.5dB is obtained as a bonus. Therefore, advantages such as increased data rate and reduced PAPR make the proposed SEE-OFDM very attractive for optical wireless systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136284/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15257337","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7136284/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SEE-OFDM: Spectral and energy efficient OFDM for optical IM/DD systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEE-OFDM: Spectral and energy efficient OFDM for optical IM/DD systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p851elgala.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05789S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7136285,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Kashef","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A & M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kashef","id":"37568996800"},{"name":"Mohamed Abdallah","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A & M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Abdallah","id":"37407917800"},{"name":"Khalid Qaraqe","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A & M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Qaraqe","id":"37391743500"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"},{"name":"Murat Uysal","affiliation":["Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Uysal","id":"37278726600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136285","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Optical attenuators","Optical distortion","Lighting","Optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light emitting diodes","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optical modulation","optimisation","power control","resource allocation","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","OFDM-based visible light communication systems","VLC network","optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","O-OFDM","optical signal clipping effect","direct current bias","LED transmitters","resource allocation techniques"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the performance of a visible light communication (VLC) network exploiting power control is considered.

This paper investigates a stepwise radio resource allocation (RRA) scheme in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based relay/cellular network. The proposed scheme is implemented by three procedures: mobile association, subcarrier allocation and load balancing. After mobile association, we choose greedy algorithm to maximize the system throughput during subcarrier allocation. Load balancing is applied to avoid system bottlenecks as well as improve the resource utilization. The main contribution of this work is that we take load balancing into consideration.

In the proposed method, we generalize our previously proposed simplified Variable Scaled Min-Sum (SVS-min-sum) by replacing the sub-optimal starting value and heuristic update for the scaling factor sequence by optimized values. Density evolution and Nelder-Mead optimization are used offline, prior to the decoding, to obtain the optimal starting point and per iteration updating step size for the scaling factor sequence of the proposed scaling strategy. The optimization of these parameters proves to be of noticeable positive impact on the decoding performance. We used different DVB-T2 LDPC codes in our simulation. Simulation results show the superior performance (in both WER and latency) of the proposed algorithm to other Min-Sum based algorithms. In addition to that, generalized SVS-min-sum algorithm has very close performance to LLR-SPA with much lower complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136292/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15257381","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7136292/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generalized simplified variable-scaled min sum LDPC decoder for irregular LDPC codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized simplified variable-scaled min sum LDPC decoder for irregular LDPC codes","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p892emran.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069235S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7136294,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

The irregularity of the degrees seriously damages the performance, visible by an abrupt error floor.

The hardware implementations of successive cancellation (SC) decoding and List SC decoding are increasing dramatically now. However, throughput of these hardware structures remain to be improved on the one hand. On the other hand, stochastic computation is now wildly used because it uses simple structures to implement complicated mathematical operations and thus improves the throughput. This paper extends the application of stochastic computation to the decoding of polar codes. A family of SC decoders based on stochastic computation are proposed, including decoders based on bipolar stochastic computation(BSC-SC), low bits stochastic computation(LBSC-SC) and improved stochastic computation(ISC-SC). These methods have high generality and improve the throughput over SC decoder while having 0.5dB loss in decoding performance. The proposed 32-bit ISC-SC decoder has a better decoding accuracy and improves throughput over BSC-SC. It also reduces the hardware cost and latency compared to LBSC-SC decoder.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136295","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136295.pdf","startPage":"908","endPage":"912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive cancellation decoders of polar codes based on stochastic computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Successive cancellation decoders of polar codes based on stochastic computation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15257325","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136295/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136295/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive cancellation decoders of polar codes based on stochastic computation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p908xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053732S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7136297,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wen","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085360517"},{"name":"Razieh Razavi","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Razieh","lastName":"Razavi","id":"37720441200"},{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37268994500"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali Imran","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ali","lastName":"Imran","id":"37265529100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136297","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"Low density signature for OFDM (LDS-OFDM) is able to achieve satisfactory performance in overloaded conditions, but the existing LDS-OFDM has the drawback of slow convergence rate for multiuser detection (MUD) and high receiver complexity.

We consider a general cooperation policy where the packet admission and queue selection probabilities, at the secondary user, are both dependent on the state (length) of the finite relaying buffer.

We assume the presence of dedicated sensors that capture the spatio-temporal spectrum usage statistics to create the radio environment map. We exploit the map to find not only the best hops along a route but also the best available channel in terms of the expected performance. Through the use of edge nodes, which lie in the intersection of more than one sensors' domain, inter-domain routing is facilitated. The selection of each hop, the channel to be used per hop, and the transmitting power to be used considers i) protection of primary receivers, and ii) maximization of desired performance metric. In this context, we propose a novel power control mechanism that computes just enough power to maintain the desired signal-to-noise ratio for secondary communication but at the same time protects the primary receivers in the vicinity. We analyze and compute the probability of network connectivity by finding the minimum spanning tree of the graph formed by the over-lapping domains. Through simulations, we show how the proposed routing scheme works in terms of route capacity, connectivity of the network, reachability among the nodes, and number of primary receivers protected.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136303","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136303.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136303","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","startPage":"947","endPage":"952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum map aided multi-channel multi-hop routing in distributed cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum map aided multi-channel multi-hop routing in distributed cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136303/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257480","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum map aided multi-channel multi-hop routing in distributed cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p947debroy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086339S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136304,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed El Shafie","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Giza, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed El","lastName":"Shafie","id":"37085361170"},{"name":"Tamer Khattab","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Khattab","id":"37282020000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136304","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Interference","Decoding","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","diversity reception","quality of service","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication scheduling","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative protocol","primary users","secondary users","time resource partitioning","discrete time slot","scheduling","time division multiple access scheme","secondary relays","primary packet decoding","cooperative beamforming","diversity multiplexing tradeoff","quality of service","cooperative cognitive relaying"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136304","abstract":"This paper proposes a new cooperative protocol which involves cooperation between primary and secondary users.

If more than one relay can decode the primary packet, the secondary relays then employ cooperative beamforming to forward the packet and to provide protection to the destination of the SU scheduled for transmission from interference.

Linear precoding is adopted at the transmitter and, thus, the number of users to be served at each particular scheduling period is limited by the number of available transmit and receive antennas. The adopted scheduling criterion for the user selection is based on proportional fair criterion. The novelty relies on the fact that the users are considered to have a finite battery capacity and a harvesting source that allows them to recharge their batteries dynamically. The proposed user scheduler mechanism exploits not only the channel dynamics but also the battery fluctuations. We analyze how the intensity of the energy arrivals impacts the performance of the user scheduler. Simulations results show that the average long-term rates approach the requested quality of service if the scheduler controls the amount of energy that is being used by the terminals at each scheduling period.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136306","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136306.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-aware user scheduling for downlink multiuser-MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136306/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-aware user scheduling for downlink multiuser-MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257321","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136306/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-aware user scheduling for downlink multiuser-MIMO systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p965rubio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060829S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136309,"authors":[{"name":"Haina Ye","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haina","lastName":"Ye","id":"38236564300"},{"name":"Zhenhui Tan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhui","lastName":"Tan","id":"37278529400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136309","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Resource management","Wireless communication","OFDM","Heuristic algorithms","Joints","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","energy consumption","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient utility-based resource allocation","OFDMA systems","green communications","heterogeneous services","energy consumption","power allocation algorithm","energy-efficient utility- based algorithm","EEUBA","quality-of-service constraints","QoS","orthogonal frequency division multiple access network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-efficient utility","resource allocation","quality-of-service","Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)"]}],"abstract":"Energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important topic in green communications.

We propose a scheme where the cognitive radio user (secondary user) may combine some of the arrived packets into a single larger packet or split each of them into smaller packets to increase its maximum mean stable arrival rate. We consider sensing errors and study two channel models; namely, collision channel model, where concurrent transmissions cause definite packets loss, and multi-packet reception channel model, where packet could survive from interference if the received signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio is greater than a certain threshold. When the channel is a collision channel, the objective function of the optimization problem which characterizes the stability region is shown to be log-concave. The optimization problem can be easily converted to a concave program that can be solved efficiently and reliably. When the channel is a multi-packet channel model, the problem is a simple grid search over the divisors and multiples of the original packets size. The results show the gains of the proposed technique and demonstrate its ability to alleviate the sensing errors' negative impact on the secondary stable throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136317/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15272532","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136317/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Throughput maximization via adjusting packet size of a buffered cognitive radio user","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput maximization via adjusting packet size of a buffered cognitive radio user","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1024elshafie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056029S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136321,"authors":[{"name":"Ningyu Chen","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ningyu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085341629"},{"name":"Pengxiang Hu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pengxiang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085350684"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Tao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Tao","id":"37288199300"},{"name":"Qimei Cui","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qimei","lastName":"Cui","id":"37566866200"},{"name":"Yujing Shang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yujing","lastName":"Shang","id":"37085369227"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136321","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Quality of service","OFDM","Linear programming","Optimization","Aggregates","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","integer programming","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency resource allocation","OFDM system","mixed traffic","wireless communication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","spectral efficiency","mixed integer nonlinear programming problem","MINLP problem","power allocation","subcarrier allocation","two-step resource allocation algorithm","TSRA algorithm","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions","KKT conditions","parametric programming problem","Dinkelbach theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["resource allocation","energy efficiency","mixed traffic","utility function"]}],"abstract":"Energy efficiency is becoming more and more important to the development of wireless communication. In this paper, we study energy-efficient resource allocation in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system with mixed traffic. Considering both the energy efficiency and spectral efficiency, we model the allocation of sub-carriers and power as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem maximizing the utility per Watt. The formulated problem is non-convex and is computationally forbidden. To simplify the solution of the problem, a two-step resource allocation (TSRA) algorithm is proposed. In the first step, we simplify the problem to a convex one and obtain the sub-carrier allocation using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. On this basis, we solve the power allocation problem in the second step by transforming it into a parametric programming problem and applying Dinkelbach's theory. Simulation results show that our algorithm can provide 28% energy efficiency improvement compared to conventional algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136321","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136321.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"1046","endPage":"1050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable energy efficiency resource allocation in OFDM system with mixed traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Achievable energy efficiency resource allocation in OFDM system with mixed traffic","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136321/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257407","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136321/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable energy efficiency resource allocation in OFDM system with mixed traffic","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1046chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086013S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136323,"authors":[{"name":"Junhyuk Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Eng., Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST), S.

Then, we proposed an energy efficient user grouping algorithm for applications in MU-MIMO systems which finds a solution close to optimal by swapping users between different groups and comparing the transmit powers.

We propose a new cooperative cognitive relaying protocol that allows the SU to relay a fraction of the undelivered primary packets. We consider an interference channel model (or a multi-packet reception (MPR) channel model), where concurrent transmissions can survive with certain probability characterized by the complement of channel outages.

To solve the formulation with low complexity, we propose a two-level iterative Subchannels, Power, and MCS allocation Algorithm (SPMA) by exploiting Tabu Search (TS). At each iteration, the SPMA firstly assigns MCS to users and then allocates subchannels and power based on a SubChannels and Power allocation Algorithm (SCPA). Particularly, the SCPA maximizes the system sum-rate by first satisfying the minimum rate requirements with the least transmit power. Simulation results show that the SPMA outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of sum-rate and average rate per user, as well as demonstrate that the sum-rate is distributed flexibly among users in instantaneous channel conditions with the SPMA.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136326","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136326.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-rate maximization in OFDMA downlink systems: A joint subchannels, power, and MCS allocation approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136326/","displayDocTitle":"Sum-rate maximization in OFDMA downlink systems: A joint subchannels, power, and MCS allocation approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257329","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136326/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-rate maximization in OFDMA downlink systems: A joint subchannels, power, and MCS allocation approach","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1073bian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101748S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136328,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Fan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Fan","lastName":"Chen","id":"38248146300"},{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280758200"},{"name":"Wern-Ho Sheen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wern-Ho","lastName":"Sheen","id":"37085420285"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136328","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Macrocell networks","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Throughput","Joints","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","interference suppression","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint user scheduling","interference alignment","heterogeneous wireless networks","small cell networks","intercell interference","ICI reduction","beamforming vector","IA system","hierarchical overlaying macrocell networks","random pairing","base stations","cell edge users","SNR-based pairing","SINR-based pairing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference alignment","interference management","user scheduling and heterogeneous network"]}],"abstract":"Small cell networks are the key to the success of the next generation wireless systems because of the potential huge capacity gain, but pose many challenges on managing the inter-cell interference from huge number of small cells and that from macrocells. Recently, an interesting technique, called interference alignment (IA), was proposed to align the mutual inter-cell interference (ICI) in the same sub-space by designing the beamforming vector among the coordinated cells. Because of the reduced ICI, the system capacity of an IA system can be improved. Nevertheless, the methods of selecting a group of users for the IA system has been rarely seen in the literature, especially in the macrocell/small cells hierarchical overlaying networks. In this paper, we investigate the effects of pairing users and base stations in an IA-based hierarchical overlaying macrocell/small cells networks. Furthermore, we design an IA scheme that can not only reduce the inter-cell interference among small cells, but also avoid interfering with the overlaying macrocell. Comparing to the conventional IA scheme based on the random pairing for users and base stations, the sum rate of the proposed joint user scheduling and IA beamforming design is 30% and 64.5% improved for the cell edge users with the SNR-based and SINR-based pairing for the users and base stations.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136328","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136328.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136328","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint user scheduling and interference alignment beamforming in heterogeneous wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint user scheduling and interference alignment beamforming in heterogeneous wireless networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136328/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136328/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257304","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint user scheduling and interference alignment beamforming in heterogeneous wireless networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1083chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05853S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136330,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Molina","affiliation":["Dept.

Both the transmit power constraint of femto base stations and the SINR thresholds of femto users and macro users are considered. We model the subchannel and power allocation problem as a non-cooperative game and a price function is introduced. To decrease the computational complexity, joint subchannel and power allocation are decomposed into two steps and a distributed resource allocation scheme is proposed to resolve the resource allocation problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in terms of energy efficiency compared with equal power allocation and an energy-efficient power control algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed energy-efficient algorithm for resource allocation in downlink femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136344","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136344.pdf","startPage":"1169","endPage":"1174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A distributed energy-efficient algorithm for resource allocation in downlink femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136344/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15301837","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed energy-efficient algorithm for resource allocation in downlink femtocell networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1169li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12126S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136345,"authors":[{"name":"Zhilin Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switch Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhilin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085416258"},{"name":"Hui Tian","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switch Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Tian","id":"37287120100"},{"name":"Liqi Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switch Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"38266845500"},{"name":"Gaofeng Nie","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switch Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Nie","id":"38264923100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136345","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Throughput","Femtocells","Couplings","Downlink","Long Term Evolution","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["component carrier selection scheme","CSG femtocell","LTE-advanced downlink system","closed subscriber group","macrocell user equipment","MUE","interference avoidance","throughput performance","spectral efficiency","frequency reuse scheme","Long Term Evolution","co-channel deployment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Component Carrier Selection","CSG Femtocells","Co-channel","LTE-Advanced"]}],"abstract":"In macro and Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) femtocells co-channel deployment, femtocells and Macrocell User Equipments (MUEs) suffer strong interference from neighboring femtocells. The interference seriously degrades MUEs' throughput performance or even causes outage. To solve this issue, we provide a centralized component carrier selection scheme. By globally optimizing femtocells' and MUEs' component carrier selection, the proposed scheme can not only avoid the interference among femtocells and the MUEs' interference from femtocells simultaneously, but also maximize the system spectral efficiency and improve MUEs' throughput performance on this basis. Simulation results demonstrate under high data rate demands the proposed scheme can greatly improve MUEs' performance both in total throughput and outage rate than the classical universal frequency reuse scheme. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can achieve better femtocells' total throughput performance than the hard frequency reuse 1/2 scheme.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136345","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A component carrier selection scheme in macro and CSG femtocells co-channel deployment for LTE-Advanced downlink systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A component carrier selection scheme in macro and CSG femtocells co-channel deployment for LTE-Advanced downlink systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136345/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257442","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A component carrier selection scheme in macro and CSG femtocells co-channel deployment for LTE-Advanced downlink systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1175li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060316S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136349,"authors":[{"name":"Weilong Ren","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.

To exploit the tolerance to delay a buffer for preempted secondary calls is considered. From the mathematical point of view, our contribution is to develop a teletraffic model for the performance evaluation of the proposed strategies. The tradeoff between the spectrum leasing cost and system Erlang capacity is also investigated. For a given maximum allowed number of simultaneously rented channels and Quality of Service (QoS) requirement in terms of new call blocking probability, maximum Erlang capacity is obtained for different traffic scenarios. Numerical results reveal that system performance strongly depends on the value of the mean secondary channel holding time relative to the mean primary channel holding time. Finally, the cost per capacity and mean transmission delay as a function of both the utilization factor of the primary resources and the maximum allowed number of simultaneously rented channels is evaluated. It is shown that anticipated resource leasing is an effective mechanism to increase the possibility to have available resources when needed for the secondary network.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1205","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136350.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum leasing strategies for coordinated cognitive radio networks with delay-tolerant traffic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7136350/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum leasing strategies for coordinated cognitive radio networks with delay-tolerant traffic","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257540","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum leasing strategies for coordinated cognitive radio networks with delay-tolerant traffic","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1200ramirezreyna.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075571S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136352,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chuan Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chuan","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37564864600"},{"name":"Feng-Tsun Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Feng-Tsun","lastName":"Chien","id":"37288625800"},{"name":"Ronald Y.

The SPs as leaders compete in offering subscription prices (upper-level subgame) and the SUs as followers compete in selecting service from the SPs (lower-level subgame). The lower-level subgame incorporates the time-varying spectrum availability as the external state so that the proposed scheme does not require knowledge of dynamic spectrum availability.

The routing of packets is viewed as a market-based phenomenon where channels are traded between transmitters and receivers. Message routes are determined through a series of auctions between message senders and forwarders. The use of auction facilitates the determination of the cost of bandwidth in a market-like scenario, hence the price to be paid by the senders, for each of the possible routes. The process involves the forwarders (or, bidders) bidding the price and the sender choosing the winner with the minimum bid. While the proposed schema explores all routes from the source to the destination through a repeated bidding process, the route with the minimum payment is chosen as the optimal solution that satisfies the requirement of the sender. Bidders determine their bid based on three utility values: i) signal to interference and noise ratio on a specific channel, ii) achievable capacity on each channel, and iii) the required bandwidth to satisfy the buyer's bit rate requirement. We consider two cases: i) sellers can bid for only one channel; in this case the bid is for the channel which satisfies the bit rate requirement and has the minimum price and ii) sellers can bid for a combination of non-substitutable channels that collectively satisfy the bit rate requirement. Since exploring all possible combinations of channels is NR-hard, we propose a greedy heuristic that takes O(nlogn). We validate the proposed auction based routing through extensive simulation experiments.

Energy detection is one of the simplest method for spectrum sensing and has the best performance in theory for signals without special features. However, it is well-known that energy detection is vulnerable to noise uncertainty. There is still no good approach to solve the problem. On the other hand, robust hypothesis testing has been known for a long time, which is a general paradigm to deal with uncertain signal and noise. In this paper, we use this paradigm to tackle the noise uncertainty problem. It is shown that the noise uncertainty can be formed as an \u03f5-contamination model. Then it is proved that the robust hypothesis testing turns to robust energy detection for independent signal samples with Gaussian distribution. Methods are found for calculating the parameters in the testing. Simulations show that the robust energy detection achieves better average performance than the energy detection on uncertain noise environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15272569","htmlLink":"/document/7136355/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robust energy detection for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust energy detection for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1228zeng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081971S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136359,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyti Ma","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Network, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongyti","lastName":"Ma","id":"37088104860"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Network, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Weiling Wu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Network, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Weiling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085394530"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136359","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136359","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio","Wireless networks","Distribution functions","Quality of service","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","geometry","quality of service","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio ad hoc networks","throughput formulation","random nodes","average value","achievable rate coverage probability","complementary cumulative distribution function","CCDF","secondary users","primary outage constraint","stochastic geometric analysis","primary nodes","secondary nodes","quality of service","QoS"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136359","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136359.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rethinking the achievable throughput formulation of cognitive radio ad hoc networks","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the achievable throughput of cognitive radio ad hoc networks. The current research on throughput evaluations focus on the average value over spatial distribution of random nodes. However, these average models neglect performance discrepancies resulting from different spatial nodes. In order to overcome this limitation, we derive the achievable rate coverage probability (equivalent to complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF)) of the secondary network according to the random locations of secondary users. Based on the achievable rate coverage probability, the achievable throughput is derived for the secondary network under the primary outage constraint. Through stochastic geometric analysis, it is shown that the achievable throughput is mainly dominated by the densities of primary and secondary nodes, as well as the quality of service (QoS) of the primary network and the rate coverage probability of the secondary network. Besides, the achievable rate coverage probability is optimized to maximize the achievable throughput of the secondary network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136359/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15257355","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136359/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rethinking the achievable throughput formulation of cognitive radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rethinking the achievable throughput formulation of cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1249ma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082516S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136365,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Mouradian","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, INRIA, CITI, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Mouradian","id":"37085423400"},{"name":"Xuan Linh Nguyen","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, INRIA, CITI, France"],"firstName":"Xuan Linh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085443593"},{"name":"Isabelle Aug\u00e9-Blum","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, INRIA, CITI, France"],"firstName":"Isabelle","lastName":"Aug\u00e9-Blum","id":"38270498100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136365","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136365","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Delays","Storms","Energy consumption","Synchronization","Protocols","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","alarm systems","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alarm storm prevention","WSN anomaly detection application","forest fire","landslide","intrusion detection","collection point","network congestion","energy consumption","network collisions","redundant alarm reduction","MAC process","routing process","reliability"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preventing alarm storms in WSNs anomaly detection applications","startPage":"1279","endPage":"1283","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136365","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) anomaly detection applications aim at identifying events which occur in a monitored area. Forest fire, landslide or intrusion detection are some examples. In order to perform anomaly detection, wireless sensors are deployed in the area of interest and the nodes monitor a physical parameter. If this parameter exceeds a predefined threshold, the node generates an alarm and sends it in direction of the collection point (the sink). In some cases, the anomaly can span over several nodes, so each of the nodes produces one alarm, resulting in several alarms sent for the same event. These alarms are produced and sent in a very short amount of time, this phenomenon is called alarm storm and causes network congestion, collisions and increases the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a mechanism which allows to reduce the number of redundant alarms. The proposed mechanism consists in a competition among nodes sensing the anomaly, which aims at determining the node which is the better located to actually send the alarm. The proposed mechanism is evaluated by extensive simulations, the results show that the scheme is able to reduce drastically the number of redundant alarms while not interfering on the MAC and routing processes which guarantee timeliness and reliability to anomaly detection applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136365/","accessionNumber":"15257305","displayDocTitle":"Preventing alarm storms in WSNs anomaly detection applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preventing alarm storms in WSNs anomaly detection applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1279mouradian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054512S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7136367,"authors":[{"name":"P\u00e5l Frenger","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Sweden"],"firstName":"P\u00e5l","lastName":"Frenger","id":"37348438200"},{"name":"Magnus Olsson","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Olsson","id":"37573539300"},{"name":"Erik Eriksson","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Eriksson","id":"38513820400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136367","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"abstract":"This paper evaluates the technology potential of using massive MIMO beamforming as a tool to enhance energy performance of radio networks.

The simulation results indicate that massive MIMO beamforming can reduce network area power consumption significantly; especially if the gains are taken into account in the network planning process by enabling a deployment with larger inter site distance compared to the reference three-sectorized deployment without massive MIMO antenna systems. As an example we note that 5 dB additional link budget achieved by the massive MIMO beamforming can be used to reduce network area power consumption with 50% if we design the network for a 10 Mbps

performance","abstract":"This paper presents a clean slate radio network solution, that has been designed with the aim to maximize energy performance. In traditional radio network designs, the energy cost for providing coverage (idle mode functionality) is totally dominating the network energy consumption. Here, a logical separation between idle mode functions and user plane data transmission and reception will be assumed. This allows us to meet the key challenge of reducing idle mode energy consumption in the network by designing for DTX and DRX also in the network nodes. The clean slate energy optimized system design targets this challenge with a new way of transmitting system information and performing initial system access. To illustrate the technology potential of the solution a simple system level evaluation is provided. It is shown that the gain of transmitting system information in a single frequency network (SFN) format is shown to be more than 4 dB at an inter site distance (ISD) of 10000 meters. Furthermore, with certain assumptions on future hardware it is estimated that the proposed concept can reduce area power consumption with up to 95% compared to a reference system of today.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136369/","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136369/","accessionNumber":"15257496","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A clean slate radio network designed for maximum energy performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A clean slate radio network designed for maximum energy performance","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1300frenger.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054743S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7136371,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijeet Bhorkar","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhijeet","lastName":"Bhorkar","id":"37085368096"},{"name":"Christian Ibars","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Ibars","id":"37295876200"},{"name":"Pingping Zong","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pingping","lastName":"Zong","id":"37085364810"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136371","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1063},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Stochastic processes","Long Term Evolution","Geometry","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","channel allocation","Long Term Evolution","stochastic processes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wi-Fi","multichannel performance","Long Term Evolution in unlicensed band","stochastic geometry","LTE-U","WiFi cell placement","Poisson point process","transmission activity modeling","simple sequential inhibition","SSI point processes","carrier sense multiple access","listen-before-talk","LBT protocol","classical hidden node problem","channel selection mechanism","CSMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the multi-channel performance of large scale deployment of Long Term Evolution (LTE) in Unlicensed (LTE-U) band and WiFi using stochastic geometry is studied. LTE-U and WiFi cell placement is modeled as a Poisson Point Process (PPP), while transmission activity is modeled as hardcore simple sequential inhibition (SSI) point processes, which have been shown to accurately model Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) access. This stochastic geometry based framework is used to analyze the co-existence of LTE-U and WiFi systems operating in the same set of available channels in unlicensed band. Several interesting results are derived. First, it is shown that fair coexistence can be achieved by LTE-U implementing a Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) protocol. Different variations of LBT are explored to improve the co-existence. Secondly, it is shown that the classical hidden node problem can severely affect performance, and that channel selection mechanisms can significantly alleviate the problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of LTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed band using stochastic geometry","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136371","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136371.pdf","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of LTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed band using stochastic geometry","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136371/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257394","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of LTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed band using stochastic geometry","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1310bhorkar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041796S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136375,"authors":[{"name":"Andra M.

However, deploying LTE femtocells increases the interference in the network, as they share licensed spectrum with the macro-cellular network. Consequently, a wide range of interference mitigation techniques have been proposed to enable coexistence of femtocells and macrocells. Techniques of various implementation and signaling complexity have been considered, but the majority of existing work evaluates their performance solely based on how well they mitigate interference for macrocell users. However, it is important that both macrocell and femtocell users achieve good performance. In this paper we present a comparative system-level study on the performance of several LTE femtocell frequency and power allocation schemes. We investigate whether more complex and dynamic resource allocation schemes, i.e. power control, are worthwhile from the point of view of femtocell networks compared to lower complexity static resource allocation schemes. We evaluate the performance in terms of the users' downlink throughput and achieved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and we consider different interference environments for a wide range of network densities (urban, suburban, and rural scenarios). Our results show that power control algorithms only yield a marginal increase in throughput for the LTE femtocell users. This suggests that increasing the complexity of static frequency allocation schemes by implementing power control algorithms is not justified.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136375.pdf","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1337","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference mitigation in two-tier LTE networks: Does power control pay off for femtocells?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Power control","Throughput","Femtocells","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","power control","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["achieved SINR","achieved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","user downlink throughput","lower-complexity static resource allocation scheme","dynamic resource allocation scheme","complex resource allocation scheme","power allocation scheme","frequency allocation scheme","signaling complexity","interference mitigation technique","macro-cellular network","licensed spectrum","offloading traffic","LTE femtocell networks","power control algorithm","two-tier LTE cellular networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation in two-tier LTE networks: Does power control pay off for femtocells?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257550","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation in two-tier LTE networks: Does power control pay off for femtocells?","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1332voicu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055649S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136382,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Peng","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085345228"},{"name":"Juei-Chin Shen","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Juei-Chin","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085353024"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407590900"},{"name":"Khaled B.

In this paper, we consider a cooperative wireless caching network where all the base stations (BSs) are connected to a central controller via backhaul links. In such a network, users can get the required data locally if they are cached at the BSs. Otherwise, the user data need to be assigned from the central controller to BSs via backhaul. In order to reduce the network cost, i.e., the back-haul cost and the transmit power cost, the data assignment for different BSs and the coordinated beamforming to serve different users need to be jointly designed. We formulate such a design problem as the minimization of the network cost, subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraint of each user and the transmit power constraint of each BS. This problem involves mixed-integer programming and is highly complicated. In order to provide an efficient solution, the connection between the data assignment and the sparsity-introducing norm is established. Low-complexity algorithms are then proposed to solve the joint optimization problem, which essentially decouple the data assignment and the transmit power minimization beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively minimize the network cost and provide near optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136382","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"1370","endPage":"1374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint data assignment and beamforming for backhaul limited caching networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint data assignment and beamforming for backhaul limited caching networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136382/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257456","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136382/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data assignment and beamforming for backhaul limited caching networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1370peng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049347S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136384,"authors":[{"name":"Keyvan Zarifi","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co.

The use of our soft association concept when forming VTP sets facilitates load-balancing among various TPs.

Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can significantly improve the overall sleep energy efficiency gain of distributed MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136391.pdf","startPage":"1421","endPage":"1425","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient sleep strategy for distributed MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","MIMO","Energy consumption","Quality of service","Time factors","Measurement","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","energy conservation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed MIMO systems","EE","BS","multiple-input multiple-output systems","closed-form expression","optimum antenna sleep period","sleep energy efficiency gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy efficiency","distributed MIMO","sleep strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient sleep strategy for distributed MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257434","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient sleep strategy for distributed MIMO systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1421huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053177S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136401,"authors":[{"name":"Jessica Oueis","affiliation":["CEA, LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Oueis","id":"37085349264"},{"name":"Emilio Calvanese Strinati","affiliation":["CEA, LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Emilio Calvanese","lastName":"Strinati","id":"38196073400"},{"name":"Sergio Barbarossa","affiliation":["Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Barbarossa","id":"38667678000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136401","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":495},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Optimization","Femtocells","Minimization","Uplink","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption limitation","delay constraint","base station deployment scenario","radio resource availability","femto-cloud platform","storage capacity","femtocell access point","small cell clustering","distributed cloud computing","networking architecture","femtocell network"]}],"abstract":"Femto-cloud is a novel networking architecture that joins femtocells networks and computation offloading to the cloud in a single framework. This allows to form server farms of femtocell access points providing cloud services. However, femtocells cannot offer the same computation and storage capacities as traditional cloud servers. In the femto-cloud platform, femtocells cooperate together through cluster formation. Effective cooperation between femtocells through clustering has to take into account many challenging limitations such as radio resources availability, base stations deployment scenarios, delay constraints and power consumption limitations. These parameters affect the choice of the femtocells cluster size and the computation load distribution. In this paper, we evaluate different strategies of clustering in the femto-cloud framework and show their effect on cluster characteristics in terms of size, latency, and power consumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small cell clustering for efficient distributed cloud computing","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136401","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136401.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Small cell clustering for efficient distributed cloud computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136401/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15272550","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small cell clustering for efficient distributed cloud computing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1474oueis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054803S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7136402,"authors":[{"name":"Zdenek Becvar","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Becvar","id":"37595063900"},{"name":"Jan Plachy","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Plachy","id":"37085494434"},{"name":"Pavel Mach","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Mach","id":"37407853100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136402","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":548},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Handover","Energy consumption","Computational modeling","Mobile communication","DSL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","convergence","Markov processes","mobile computing","mobile radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","telecommunication computing","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile network handover","mobile cloud computing","base station","mobile networks convergence","user equipment","small cell cloud","SCC","cloud-enabled small cells","UE","path selection metrics","transmission delay","energy consumption","offloaded data transmission","Markov decision process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["small cells","mobile cloud computing","path selection","energy efficiency","LTE"]}],"abstract":"To overcome latency constrain of common mobile cloud computing, computing capabilities can be integrated into a base station in mobile networks.

We show that the well-established condition for continuum percolation does not hold true in the SINR regime. Thus, we find the condition under which a cognitive radio network percolates. We argue that due to the SINR requirements of the secondaries along with the interference tolerance of the primaries, not all the deployed secondary nodes necessarily contribute towards the percolation process- even though they might participate in the communication process. We model the invisibility of such nodes using the concept of Poisson thinning, both in the presence and absence of primaries. Invisibility occurs due to nodes that i) cannot decode transmissions except from their nearest neighbors, ii) are always interfered, and iii) belong to isolated components. We find the thinning probability in terms of primary and secondary densities, communication radii, and interference cancellation coefficient. Further, we show how the effective coverage radius shrinks which also adds to the thinning. Theoretical findings are validated through simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15257419","htmlLink":"/document/7136405/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Percolation condition for interference-limited cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Percolation condition for interference-limited cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1496altameemi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048945S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7136406,"authors":[{"name":"Shameek Bhattacharjee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando"],"firstName":"Shameek","lastName":"Bhattacharjee","id":"38236524900"},{"name":"Mainak Chatterjee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando"],"firstName":"Mainak","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37278542600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136406","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Collaboration","Cognitive radio","Computational modeling","Sensors","Transmitters","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","parameter estimation","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust based channel preference","cognitive radio networks","collaborative selfish attacks","secondary spectrum data falsification","local sensing data","collaborative SSDF attack","Bayesian inference","attacked channels"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trust based channel preference in cognitive radio networks under collaborative selfish attacks","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","endPage":"1507","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136406.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136406","startPage":"1502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136406","abstract":"Secondary spectrum data falsification (SSDF) is a common attack in cognitive radio networks, where dishonest nodes share spurious local sensing data. This behavior misleads the collective inference on spectrum occupancy. The situation is more aggravated when a collaborative SSDF attack is launched by a coalition of selfish nodes. Defense against such collaborative attacks is difficult with popularly used voting based inference models. This paper proposes a method based on Bayesian inference that indicates how much the collective decision on a channel's occupancy can be trusted. Using an anomaly monitoring technique, we check if the reports sent by a node match with the expected occupancy and classify the outcomes into three categories: i) if there is a match, ii) if there is a mismatch, and iii) if it cannot be decided. Based on the measured observations over time, we estimate the parameters of the hypothesis of match and mismatch events using a multinomial Bayesian based inference. We quantitatively define the trust as the difference between the posterior beliefs associated with matches and that of mismatches. The posterior beliefs are updated based on a weighted average of the prior information on the belief itself and the recently observed data. We conduct simulation experiments that show that the proposed trust model is able to distinguish the attacked channels from the non-attacked ones. Also, a node is able to rank the channels based on how trustworthy the inference on a channel is. We are also able to show that attacked channels have significantly lower trust values than channels that are not.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15272535","htmlLink":"/document/7136406/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Trust based channel preference in cognitive radio networks under collaborative selfish attacks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trust based channel preference in cognitive radio networks under collaborative selfish attacks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1502bhattacharjee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057721S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136407,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Li","id":"37597745900"},{"name":"Xinyi Kong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xinyi","lastName":"Kong","id":"37085575389"},{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136407","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"abstract":"A two-phase spatiotemporal adaptive transmission and spectrum sharing mechanism is designed for multi-input multi-output cooperative cognitive radio network (MIMO-CCRN). By employing cognitive user(s) as relay(s), performance of end-to-end primary transmission is improved. On the other hand, secondary user (SU) can access to the spectrum for its own data transmission simultaneously with the primary, as a reward for assisting the primary's data delivery. With the proposed scheme, multiple SU pairs participate in the data relaying, and share the access authority following a time division multiplexing mode. By joint transmit precoding and receive filtering design, co-channel interference can be appropriately suppressed. Moreover, bottleneck effect in the end-to-end primary link is studied, and an adaptive time slot division scheme is employed as a solution to bottleneck elimination. Simulation results show that the primary spectral efficiency is improved with the assistance of SU(s). Time domain adaptation could effectively enhance the end-to-end performance. Meanwhile, spatiotemporal multiplexing of different types of transmission facilitates the spectral efficiency. As a result, a win-win situation for both the primary and secondary is achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136407.pdf","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1513","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive cooperative transmission and spectrum sharing in MIMO-CCRN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Filtering","Data communication","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive filters","channel coding","cochannel interference","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","data communication","MIMO communication","precoding","radio links","radio spectrum management","relay networks (telecommunication)","time division multiplexing","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive cooperative transmission","MIMO-CCRN spectrum user","two-phase spatiotemporal adaptive transmission mechanism","spectrum sharing mechanism","multiinput multioutput cooperative cognitive radio network","relay performance","end-to-end primary transmission","secondary user","SU","data transmission","data relaying","time division multiplexing mode","joint transmit precoding","receive filtering design","cochannel interference","end-to-end primary link","adaptive time slot division scheme","bottleneck elimination","primary spectral efficiency","time domain","spatiotemporal multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative","cognitive radio","MIMO","interference","bottleneck"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive cooperative transmission and spectrum sharing in MIMO-CCRN","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257290","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive cooperative transmission and spectrum sharing in MIMO-CCRN","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1508li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055073S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136421,"authors":[{"name":"Waheed Ur Rehman","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Waheed","lastName":"Ur Rehman","id":"37085433237"},{"name":"Tabinda Salam","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tabinda","lastName":"Salam","id":"37721417500"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Tao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Tao","id":"37288199300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136421","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Interference","Propagation losses","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimetre wave receivers","probability","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver based distributed relay selection scheme","signal attenuation","outage probability analysis","propagation loss","interference measurement","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60-GHz networks","mmWave","distributed relay selection","outage probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136421","abstract":"Networks based on 60-GHz promise data rates in gigabits and show least tolerance towards signal blockage.

The developed model is load aware and accounts for per-user power control as well as the limited transmit power constraint for the users' equipment (UEs). The proposed analytical paradigm is based on a simple per-user power control scheme in which each user inverts his path-loss such that the signal is received at his serving base station (BS) with a certain power threshold \u03c1 Due to the limited transmit power of the UEs, users that cannot invert their path-loss to their serving BSs are allowed to transmit with their maximum transmit power. We show that the proposed power control scheme not only provides a balanced cell center and cell edge user performance, it also facilitates the analysis when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. To this end, we discuss how to manipulate the design variable \u03c1 in response to the network parameters to optimize one or more of the performance metrics such as the outage probability, the network capacity, and the energy efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136422.pdf","startPage":"1591","endPage":"1596","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load-aware modeling for uplink cellular networks in a multi-channel environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Power control","Uplink","Signal to noise ratio","Load modeling","Analytical models","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","power control","stochastic processes","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load-aware modeling","uplink cellular networks","multichannel environment","stochastic geometry","tractable analytical approach","per-user power control","limited transmit power constraint","maximum transmit power","balanced cell center","cell edge user performance","state-of-the-art approaches","outage probability","network capacity","energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Uplink transmission","power control","channel inversion","stochastic geometry","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Load-aware modeling for uplink cellular networks in a multi-channel environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136422/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15285135","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load-aware modeling for uplink cellular networks in a multi-channel environment","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1591alammouri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046142S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136427,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Babaei","affiliation":["Cable Television Laboratories, Louisville, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Babaei","id":"37427532800"},{"name":"Jennifer Andreoli-Fang","affiliation":["Cable Television Laboratories, Louisville, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Andreoli-Fang","id":"37085566983"},{"name":"Belai Hamzeh","affiliation":["Cable Television Laboratories, Louisville, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Belai","lastName":"Hamzeh","id":"37283139100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136427","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":954},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Delays","Throughput","Mobile communication","Protocols","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","radio spectrum management","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE-U","mobile data traffic","LTE networks","Wi-Fi networks","mobile network operators","unlicensed spectrum band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE unlicensed","LTE-U","Wi-Fi","radio spectrum management","heterogeneous networks coexistence"]}],"abstract":"With the exponential growth in mobile data traffic taking place currently and projected into the future, mobile operators need cost effective ways to manage the load of their networks.

A special case of cell outage, referred to as Sleeping Cell (SC) remains particularly challenging to detect in state of the art SON because in this case cell goes into outage or may perform poorly without triggering an alarm for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) entity. Consequently, no SON compensation function can be launched unless SC situation is detected via drive tests or through complaints registered by the affected customers. In this paper, we present a novel solution to address this problem that makes use of minimization of drive test (MDT) measurements recently standardized by 3GPP and NGMN. To overcome the processing complexity challenge, the MDT measurements are projected to a low-dimensional space using multidimensional scaling method. Then we apply state of the art k-nearest neighbor and local outlier factor based anomaly detection models together with pre-processed MDT measurements to profile the network behaviour and to detect SC. Our numerical results show that our proposed solution can automate the SC detection process with 93% accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136428","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136428.pdf","startPage":"1626","endPage":"1630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SON solution for sleeping cell detection using low-dimensional embedding of MDT measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136428/","displayDocTitle":"A SON solution for sleeping cell detection using low-dimensional embedding of MDT measurements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257415","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136428/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SON solution for sleeping cell detection using low-dimensional embedding of MDT measurements","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1626zoha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058667S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136429,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Felice","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Felice","id":"37540417600"},{"name":"Angelo Trotta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Trotta","id":"37073260500"},{"name":"Luca Bedogni","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Bedogni","id":"37073264600"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy Chowdhury","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Kaushik Roy","lastName":"Chowdhury"},{"name":"Luciano Bononi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Bononi","id":"37265458500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136429","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":580},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Springs","Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Mesh networks","Quality of service","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","autonomous aerial vehicles","emergency management","mobile ad hoc networks","mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication scheduling","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerial ad-hoc networks","terrestrial mobile devices","mobility management","distributed mobility algorithm","virtual spring model","repairing units","quality of service","QoS","wireless link reliability","energy lifetime","distributed charging scheduling scheme","SUAV","small unmanned aerial vehicles","emergency communication","self-organizing aerial mesh networks"]}],"abstract":"Guaranteeing network connectivity in post-disaster scenarios is challenging yet crucial to save human lives and to coordinate the operations of first responders. In this paper, we investigate the utilization of low-altitude aerial mesh networks composed by Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs) in order to re-enstablish connectivity among isolated end-user (EU) devices located on the ground. Aerial ad-hoc networks provide the advantage to be deployable also on critical scenarios where terrestrial mobile devices might not operate, however their implementation is challenging from the point of view of mobility management and of coverage lifetime. In this paper, we address both these issues with three novel research contributions. First, we propose a distributed mobility algorithm, based on the virtual spring model, through which the SUAV-based mesh node-called also Repairing Units (RUs) in this study- can self-organize into a mesh structure by guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) over the aerial link, and connecting the maximum number of EU devices. Second, we evaluate our scheme on a realistic 3D environment with buildings, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the aerial deployment compared to a terrestrial one, in terms of coverage and wireless link reliability. Third, we address the problem of energy lifetime, and we propose a distributed charging scheduling scheme, through which a persistent coverage of RUs can be guaranteed over the emergency scenario.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136429","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136429.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing aerial mesh networks for emergency communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing aerial mesh networks for emergency communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136429/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15272545","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136429/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing aerial mesh networks for emergency communication","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1631difelice.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06354S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136434,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Ihsan Canbolat","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ahmet Ihsan","lastName":"Canbolat","id":"37085373723"},{"name":"Mamadu Bah","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamadu","lastName":"Bah","id":"37085376052"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Fukawa","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Fukawa","id":"37296656900"},{"name":"Hiroshi Suzuki","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37289218200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136434","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"abstract":"This paper proposes interference suppression schemes by linear combining for wireless multiuser relay communications. Interference from base stations and relays in neighboring cells degrades bit error rate (BER) performance of mobile stations (MSs) near cell boundaries. To suppress such interference for half-duplex relay systems, the proposed methods linearly combine received signals of the first and second phases at MS. Without channel state information (CSI) feedback, weight coefficients for the linear combining are first evaluated under the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion and then estimated by the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. The MMSE combining requires information on preamble symbols of all MSs for channel estimation whereas the RLS-based linear combining requires only information on those of the target MS. In addition to the preamble symbols, the RLS algorithm can use detected symbols, which performs the decision-directed estimation. Computer simulations for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission under two-cell and frequency selective fading conditions are conducted. It is demonstrated that the RLS-based linear combining with the decision-directed estimation is superior to the RLS-based linear combining using only the preamble and can slightly outperform the MMSE

In this paper, the problem of optimally deciding on whether to install additional small cells or to upgrade current macrocell base stations (BSs) with massive antenna arrays is studied. This integrated deployment problem is cast as a general integer optimization model by using the facility location framework. The capacity limits of both the radio access link and the backhaul link are considered. The problem is shown to be an extension of the modular capacitated location problem (MCLP) which is known to be NP-hard. To solve the problem, a novel deployment algorithm that uses Lagrangian relaxation and tabu local search is proposed. The developed tabu search is shown to have a two-level structure and to be able to search the solution space thoroughly. Simulation results show how the proposed, optimal approach to upgrading an existing wireless network infrastructure can make use of a combination of both small cells and BSs with massive antennas. The results also show that the proposed algorithm can find the optimal solution effectively while having a computational time that is up to 30% lower than that of conventional algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to upgrade wireless networks: Small cells or massive MIMO?","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136439","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136439.pdf","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"How to upgrade wireless networks: Small cells or massive MIMO?","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136439/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257335","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to upgrade wireless networks: Small cells or massive MIMO?","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1685xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057943S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136455,"authors":[{"name":"Yuting Sun","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuting","lastName":"Sun","id":"38239208900"},{"name":"Wenbo Xu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404294100"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404490700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136455","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Cognitive radio","Bit error rate","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Decoding","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","encoding","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dirty paper coding scheme","multiuser MIMO cognitive radio channel","zero-forcing DPC","multiple cognitive users","primary user","cognitive transmitter","single-antenna receiver","interference cancellation","transmit power constraint","multiuser trellis shaping","power allocation parameter","scaling factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio channel","MIMO","dirty paper coding","zero-forcing","trellis shaping"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme for the cognitive radio channel where multiple cognitive users coexist with a primary user.

To match the diverse quality of service requirements imposed by a variety of applications, dynamic TDD is proposed as a solution by enabling flexible utilization of the spectrum for uplink and downlink of each cell. In this paper, the system performance of flexible (dynamic) TDD is compared to a fixed portioning of resources for uplink and downlink. Further, the degree of centralization for resource management is investigated in the context of dynamic TDD, because multi-cell scheduling will be important for the design of 5G ultra-dense network architecture. The results show that dynamic TDD is indeed a very promising option for 5G networks, and substantially decreases packet outage delays. We find that the performance gap between centralized and decentralized scheduling is small in case of planned deployments. However, centralized scheduling may be beneficial in certain dynamic TDD deployment scenarios with a very asymmetric access point distribution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136469.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136469","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance gain of flexible UL/DL TDD with centralized and decentralized resource allocation in dense 5G deployments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136469/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance gain of flexible UL/DL TDD with centralized and decentralized resource allocation in dense 5G deployments","htmlLink":"/document/7136469/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15257322","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance gain of flexible UL/DL TDD with centralized and decentralized resource allocation in dense 5G deployments","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1840venkatkumar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074438S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136473,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Chai","affiliation":["Key Lab of Mobile Communication Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, P.R.

In a CRN scenario consisting of multiple heterogeneously integrated CRNs, the SUs with multiple interfaces may have to conduct network and spectrum selection for continuous data transmission. In this paper, a spectrum selection scheme is proposed which minimizes the total transmission delay of interrupted SUs in a heterogeneous CRN under the quality of service (QoS) constraints. Applying M/G/1 queue model, the waiting delay of SUs is calculated. Jointly considering the heterogeneous characteristics of CRNs, the transmission performance of target channels and the properties of queue model, the total transmission delay of SUs is formulated, and the candidate channel with the minimum total transmission delay is selected as the target channel. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15257537","htmlLink":"/document/7136473/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Total transmission delay minimization based spectrum selection scheme for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total transmission delay minimization based spectrum selection scheme for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1862chai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069261S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136477,"authors":[{"name":"Shipeng Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Shipeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085390817"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240343100"},{"name":"Ying Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Yang","id":"37677338600"},{"name":"Guo Wei","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281335000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136477","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"abstract":"This paper considers the model that two mobile users communicate with a central processer (CP) via two base stations (BSs).

The key issues involved in the combination are presented and discussed, including scheduling algorithm, successive interference canceller (SIC) order determination, transmission power assignment and feedback design. The performances of NOMA with SU-MIMO are investigated by system-level simulations with very practical assumptions. Simulation results show that compared to orthogonal multiple access system, NOMA can achieve large performance gains both open-loop and closed-loop SU-MIMO, which are about 23% for cell average throughput and 33% for cell-edge user throughput.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136478","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluations of downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) combined with SU-MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluations of downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) combined with SU-MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136478/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257378","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7136478/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluations of downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) combined with SU-MIMO","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1887chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063818S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136481,"authors":[{"name":"Ziqi Yue","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ziqi","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085338858"},{"name":"Qing Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532545100"},{"name":"Wei Xiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Surveying, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia","School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37396484300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136481","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Signal processing algorithms","Antennas","Belief propagation","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel estimation","Gaussian channels","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex Gaussian belief propagation algorithms","distributed multicell multiuser MIMO detection","channel state information","signal-to-noise ratio","state evolution equations","CGaBP algorithm","soft interference cancellation","MMSE-SIC","pilot contamination","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a distributed detection scheme done at each antenna unit separately, termed complex Gaussian belief propagation algorithm (CGaBP), for multicell multi-user detection in imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios.

Due to economic and environmental challenges, new trends and efforts are oriented toward \u201cgreen\u201d communication especially for energy-constrained applications such as wireless sensors network and cognitive radio. To this end, we analyze the power allocation scheme that maximizes the EE defined as rate over the total power including circuit power. We derive an explicit expression of the optimal power with instantaneous channel gain based on EE criterion. We show that the relation between the EE and the spectral efficiency (SE) when the optimal power is adopted is strictly increasing in contrast with the SE-EE trade-off discussed in the literature. We also solve a non-convex problem and compute explicitly the optimal power for ergodic EE under either a peak or an average power constraint. When the instantaneous channel is not available, we provide the optimal power equation and compute simple sub-optimal power. In the numerical results, we show that the sup-optimal solution is very close to the optimal solution. In addition, we show that the absence of the channel state information (CSI) only affects the EE and the SE performances at high power regime compared to the full CSI case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136491.pdf","startPage":"1954","endPage":"1958","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On energy efficient power allocation for power-constrained systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Fading","Energy efficiency","Wireless sensor networks","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","radiocommunication","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient power allocation","power-constrained systems","wireless communication systems","green communication","energy-constrained applications","wireless sensors network","cognitive radio","channel gain","spectral efficiency","nonconvex problem","optimal power equation","sub-optimal power","channel state information","CSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","optimal power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On energy efficient power allocation for power-constrained systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136491/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257270","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On energy efficient power allocation for power-constrained systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1954sboui.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078094S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7136495,"authors":[{"name":"Daniela M.

In ED, the energy captured is compared against a fixed detection threshold, which is estimated as a function of the noise power. Uncertainties caused by the imperfect knowledge of the noise power, referred to as noise uncertainty, leads to a reduced performance of the ED, particularly at low SNR levels. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that aims to overcome the SNR-wall problem of the ED caused by the noise uncertainty effects. This proposal relies on the cooperation of multiple receivers for adapting, at each sensing period, the detection threshold to the noise power present at the time of spectrum sensing process is occurring. The preliminary evaluation show that when the detection threshold is adapted to the current noise conditions, the ED observes a significant improvement on the probability of detection under the presence of noise uncertainty, compared to the non-adaptive threshold ED. Furthermore, with our proposal, the ED performs better than the well-known Eigenvalue-based Detection (EBD) and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test-based Detection (GLRD) for low to moderate sensing time and number of cooperating receivers.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136495","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136495.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136495","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","startPage":"1975","endPage":"1979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the reduction of the noise uncertainty effects in energy detection for spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the reduction of the noise uncertainty effects in energy detection for spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136495/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136495/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15257260","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the reduction of the noise uncertainty effects in energy detection for spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p1975martinez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063341S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136509,"authors":[{"name":"Donald Chang","affiliation":["Spatial Digital Systems, Camarillo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Chang","id":"37071865300"},{"name":"Joe Lee","affiliation":["Spatial Digital Systems, Camarillo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Joe","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085368117"},{"name":"Tzer-Hso Lin","affiliation":["Spatial Digital Systems, Camarillo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tzer-Hso","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085338813"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4912-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"7136509","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transponders","Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Multiplexing","Arrays","Ports (Computers)","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing","satellite communication","satellite links","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite communication links","incompatible polarization","wavefront multiplexing techniques","fixed satellite service","FSS transponders","linearly polarized","LP space assets","FSS-covered service areas","linear polarization","circularly polarized terminals","CP terminals","satellite operators","Ku band VSAT users","LP satellite transponders","multiplexing techniques","muxing techniques","wave front multiplexing","WF multiplexing","polarization converting processor","ground user equipment","satellite assets","intended ground terminals","satellite links","ground terminals","transponder terminals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linear polarization","circular polarization","wavefront multiplexing","wavefront demultiplexing","antenna"]}],"abstract":"Many fixed satellite service (FSS) transponders in Ku band belong to the family of linearly polarized (LP) space assets. Therefore the terminals in the FSS-covered service areas also use linear polarization. In this paper, we propose, on the other hand, that circularly polarized (CP) terminals are more economical in manufacturing and installations as comparing to compatible LP terminals. The presented techniques will enable satellite operators to cost-effectively service Ku band VSAT users, either fixed or mobile, via LP space assets in Ku band. A method that makes possible the emergence of multiple g r o u p e d LP satellite transponders through Wave-Front (WF) Multiplexing (muxing) techniques is presented. Grouped LP transponders become accessible efficiently by CP ground terminals and vice versa. This method consists of a polarization converting processor in a ground hub with our modifications of ground user equipment and satellite assets. The received waveforms are processed in the digital domain in order to further service intended ground terminals. A low cost test bed is developed to emulate satellite links and implement WF muxing and WF demultiplexing (demuxing).

Among several distance-related measurements, channel impulse response (CIR) reflects multi-path situation between the transmitter and receiver pair and is suitable to describe the characteristic of different positions. Note that CIR, which can be obtained from the inverse Fourier transform of channel frequency response in broadband wireless networks, is supported in most of the commercial standards. In this paper, a novel compressive sensing based location estimation using CIR measurements (CS-CIR) is proposed as well as fingerprinting algorithm. CIR information is collected from each reference point (RP) to access point (AP) and stored in the database. During the on-line stage, the mobile user measures CIR from the AP and compares measured CIR with those CIR values in the database. Note that user position is close to one of the RPs and user position vector is represented as a sparse vector. By applying compressive sensing theory, user position can be recovered by solving l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization problem.

performance of wireless communication systems without any temporal and spectral resource expansion. Implant body area networks (BANs) require low energy consumption and in some cases high-speed transmission. Therefore, applying spatial diversity reception to implant BANs can be expected to fulfill these requirements. For this purpose, this paper presents a local frequency offset diversity system with \u03c0/4-differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) for implant BANs that offer improved communication performance with a simpler receiver structure, and evaluates the proposal's bit error rate (BER) performance. We first confirm that the local frequency offset diversity reception can effectively improve the communication performance of implant BANs. We then perform an analysis of a realistic communication performance, namely, a link budget analysis based on derived BER performance and evaluate the link parameters including system margin and maximum link distance. These results demonstrate that the local frequency offset diversity system can realize a reliable communication link in a realistic implant BAN scenario.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136531","startPage":"2164","endPage":"2167","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136531.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local frequency offset spatial diversity with pi/4-DQPSK in implant communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136531/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Local frequency offset spatial diversity with pi/4-DQPSK in implant communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136531/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15257350","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local frequency offset spatial diversity with pi/4-DQPSK in implant communications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p2164anzai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063608S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136532,"authors":[{"name":"Kasun M.

The IR-UWB receiver front-end down converts the high frequency (3.5-4.5 GHz) IR-UWB pulses using a mixer and a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) in to easily detectable base band pulses. IR-UWB pulse synchronization is implemented using the FPGA. The performance of the receiver node is experimentally evaluated by conducting Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis for an on-body to off-body communication scenario. The BER results show that a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n is achievable for a propagation distance of 1m using

The Group Detection (GD) method has been considered as a good choice because it balances well the trade-off between detection accuracy and computational complexity. This method converts the higher order MIMO channel matrix into several lower order matrices and then decodes these lower order matrices separately. In another aspect, a Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) system commonly requires a pre-coding such as Block Diagonalization (BD) to eliminate the inter-user interference (IUI). In this paper, we show that a MU-MIMO system can reuse the BD pre-coding at the transmitter to perform the GD at the receiver for reducing the complexity. To improve the performance, a Group Selection (GS) method should be used before doing GD. While the optimal GS method achieves high performance, its complexity is too high for real applications. For balancing the complexity-performance trade-off, we propose an Averaged Log Likelihood Ratio Group Detection (A-LLR-GD) in this paper. The packet error rate (PER) and Bit Error Rate (BER) simulation results on IEEE 802.11ac simulator show that our proposed one achieves higher performance with low increase in computational complexity as compared to the conventional works.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136534","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7116213/7136113/07136534.pdf","startPage":"2178","endPage":"2182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An averaged-LLR group detection for higher order MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136534/","displayDocTitle":"An averaged-LLR group detection for higher order MIMO system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"15272561","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136534/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An averaged-LLR group detection for higher order MIMO system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p2178yokota.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055535S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7116213","isNumber":"7136113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7116213","xplore-issue":"7136113","articleId":"7136534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136782,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Such a scenario arises in many applications, and array operations in underwater sound channels with emphasis on long-range sound propagation is one of the most typical cases. Another key issue is here the multimode propagation of the desired signal (and, generally, noise interference) so the spatial spectrum of the received field consists of numerous harmonics even for a single point source. In this paper, our focus is to demonstrate numerically the multimode signal coherence degradation at the large-array input, both for horizontal and vertical arrays in an underwater channel, and to predict the coherence effects on the output performance, array beampattern and gain included. The vertical array operation is emphasized to be the most interesting problem here due to the specific features of ambient noise in real oceanic channels. An essential conclusion concerns the fact that not only the signal coherence but signal localization in mode domain as is compared with the ambient noise affect together the array output performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICATT.2015.7136782","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques (ICATT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122673/7136763/07136782.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7136763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICATT.2015.7136782","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques (ICATT)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-array beamforming and gain in random multimode channels: Basic physical aspects and performance estimations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7136782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Large-array beamforming and gain in random multimode channels: Basic physical aspects and performance estimations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7136782/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7136782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15257607","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2015","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-array beamforming and gain in random multimode channels: Basic physical aspects and performance estimations","confLoc":"Kharkiv, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"018INV11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100487S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7122673","isNumber":"7136763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122673","xplore-issue":"7136763","articleId":"7136782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7136820,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Features in raw sensory data that are associated with defects could be masked by noise and therefore difficult to identify in some instances. In order to enhance these features that potentially identify defects, we propose an entropy filter that maps raw sensory data points into a local entropy measure. In the entropy space, data are then classified by means of a thresholding procedure based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to different data sets obtained from field trials.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2450236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7225207/07137613.pdf","startPage":"6399","endPage":"6408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2450236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"R\u00e9nyi Entropy Filter for Anomaly Detection With Eddy Current Remote Field Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7137613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137613/","displayDocTitle":"R\u00e9nyi Entropy Filter for Anomaly Detection With Eddy Current Remote Field Sensors","volume":"15","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15430995","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7137613/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"EGP 402129-10"},{"fundingName":"Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario"},{"fundingName":"InvoDane Engineering Ltd"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"R\u00e9nyi Entropy Filter for Anomaly Detection With Eddy Current Remote Field Sensors","sourcePdf":"jsen-spinello-2450236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142662S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7225207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7225207","articleId":"7137613","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7137616,"authors":[{"name":"You Zhou","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7158995/7137616/zhou-2431914-small.gif","p":["\nYou Zhou received the B.S. degree in physics from Peking University, \nBeijing, China, in 2010 and the Ph.D. degree in applied physics from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2015.\n","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the John A.

We emphasize the overarching electron-phonon coupling and electron-electron interaction-driven transition mechanisms and kinetics, which renders a general description of Mott memories from aspects such as nonvolatility, sensing scheme, read/write speed, and switching energy. Various memory and neuromorphic device architectures incorporating phase transition elements are reviewed, focusing on their operational principles.

While the Log-BCJR processes turbo-encoded bits in a serial forwards-backwards manner, the proposed algorithm operates in a fully-parallel manner, processing all bits in both components of the turbo code at the same time. The proposed algorithm is compatible with all turbo codes, including those of the LTE and WiMAX standards. These standardized codes employ odd-even interleavers, facilitating a novel technique for reducing the complexity of the proposed algorithm by 50%. More specifically, odd-even interleavers allow the proposed algorithm to alternate between processing the odd-indexed bits of the first component code at the same time as the even-indexed bits of the second component, and vice-versa. Furthermore, the proposed fully-parallel algorithm is shown to converge to the same error correction performance as the state-of-the-art turbo decoding algorithm. Owing to its significantly increased parallelism, the proposed algorithm facilitates throughputs and latencies that are up to 6.86 times superior to those of the state-of-the art algorithm, when employed for the LTE and WiMAX turbo codes. However, this is achieved at the cost of a moderately increased computational complexity and resource requirement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15359425","htmlLink":"/document/7137638/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Fully-Parallel Turbo Decoding Algorithm","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC, Swindon UK","grantNumber":"EP/J015520/1 and EP/L010550/1"},{"fundingName":"TSB, Swindon UK","grantNumber":"TS/L009390/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fully-Parallel Turbo Decoding Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tcomm-maunder-2450208-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159603S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7182396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7182396","articleId":"7137638","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7137639,"authors":[{"name":"Shuyuan Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, International Research Center for Intelligent Perception and Computation, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7185497/7137639/yang-2429146-small.gif","p":["\nShuyuan Yang received the B.A. degree in electrical engineering and the \nM.S. and Ph.D. degrees in circuit and system from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2000, 2003, and 2005, \nrespectively.","She is currently with the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, \nInternational Research Center for Intelligent Perception and Computation, Xidian University.

However, most of the available CHI methods separate and vectorize hyperspectral cubes into spatial and spectral vectors, which will result in heavy computational and storage burden in the recovery. Moreover, the complexity of real scene makes the sparsifying difficult and thus requires more measurements to achieve accurate recovery. In this paper, these two issues are addressed, and a new CHI approach via sparse tensors and nonlinear CS (NCS) is advanced for accurate maintenance of image structure with limited number of sensors. Based on a multidimensional multiplexing (MDMP) CS scheme, the observed measurements are denoted as tensors and a nonlinear sparse tensor coding is adopted, to develop a new tensor-NCS (T-NCS) algorithm for noniterative recovery of hyperspectral images. Moreover, two recovery schemes are advanced for T-NCS, including example-aided and self-learning CHI approaches. Finally, some experiments are performed on three real hyperspectral data sets to investigate the performance of T-NCS, and the results demonstrate its efficiency and superiority to the counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2429146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7185497/07137639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2429146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7185497","startPage":"5943","endPage":"5957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging via Sparse Tensor and Nonlinear Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7137639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging via Sparse Tensor and Nonlinear Compressed Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364250","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7137639/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB329402"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91438103  and 91438201"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"BDY021429"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Innovation Research Program"},{"fundingName":"Kunshan Innovation Institute of Xidian University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61072108 and 61 173090"},{"fundingName":"Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs","grantNumber":"B07048"},{"fundingName":"Project of Development Plan of Science and Technology in Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2013KJXX-63"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging via Sparse Tensor and Nonlinear Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-yang-2429146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170324S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7185497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7185497","articleId":"7137639","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7137643,"authors":[{"name":"Hoyoung Lee","affiliation":["Future IT Research and Development Laboratory, LG Electronics, Seoul, Korea","Digital Media Laboratory, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7372356/7137643/lee-2450151-small.gif","p":["Hoyoung Lee (M\u201914) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, in 2007 and 2014, respectively.","He is with the IT Convergence Research Center, LG Electronics, Seoul, Korea.

In this paper, two schemes (the RDOQ bypass decision and the simplified level adjustment) are investigated to reduce the complexity of the quantization process in HEVC with RDOQ. The RDOQ bypass decision method initially selects the transform blocks for which the RDOQ is expected to give less/or no coding gain and enables the conventional uniform scalar quantization to be applied to these transform blocks instead of the RDOQ. The simplified level adjustment method only estimates the difference in rate-distortion costs among the candidate quantization levels to enable the encoder to select an optimal quantization level at a much reduced computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed simplified level adjustment scheme is designed so that it can be implemented in lookup tables. Experimental results show that the proposed fast method achieves 14.3% quantization complexity reduction in all intra main conditions, 15.2% in the random access main condition, and 14.9% in the low delay main condition on average with virtually no coding loss compared with the conventional quantization process with the RDOQ.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7372356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2450151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7372356/07137643.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"116","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2450151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Quantization Method With Simplified Rate\u2013Distortion Optimized Quantization for an HEVC Encoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast Quantization Method With Simplified Rate\u2013Distortion Optimized Quantization for an HEVC Encoder","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7137643/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15689036","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korean Government within the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"2011-001-7578"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Fast Quantization Method With Simplified Rate\u2013Distortion Optimized Quantization for an HEVC Encoder","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-jeon-2450151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104555S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7372356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7372356","articleId":"7137643","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7137645,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Liu","affiliation":["Mobile Systems Design Laboratory, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7343760/7137645/liu-2450175-small.gif","p":["Yao Liu (M\u201910) is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.","His industry experiences include interning with Qualcomm, Beijing, China, in 2010, and Yahoo, Santa Clara, CA, USA, in 2013.

Compared with other video streaming applications, cloud gaming offers a unique opportunity to enhance the video encoding process by exploiting rendering information. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve cloud gaming video encoding, aiming at enhancing the perceived video quality and reducing the computational complexity, respectively. First, we develop a rendering-based prioritized encoding technique to improve the perceived game video quality according to network bandwidth constraints. We first propose a technique to generate a macroblock (MB)-level saliency map for every game video frame using rendering information. Furthermore, based on such a saliency map, a prioritized rate allocation scheme is proposed to dynamically adjust the value of quantization parameter of each MB. The experimental results indicate that the perceptual quality can be greatly improved using the proposed technique. We also develop a rendering-based encoding acceleration technique that utilizes rendering information to reduce the computational complexity of video encoding. This technique mainly consists of two parts. First, we propose a method to directly calculate the motion vectors (MVs) without employing the compute intensive motion search procedure. Second, based on the computed MVs, we propose a fast mode selection algorithm to reduce the number of candidate modes of each MB. The experimental results show that the proposed technique can achieve more than 42% saving in encoding time with very limited degradation in video quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137645/","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7137645/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15647627","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Video Encoding for Cloud Gaming Using Rendering Information","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"InterDigital, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Video Encoding for Cloud Gaming Using Rendering Information","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-liu-2450175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093871S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7343760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7343760","articleId":"7137645","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7137646,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292997100"},{"name":"Guoqiang Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0002-8618-5581","id":"37066987300"},{"name":"Wen-An Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, HangZhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen-An","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37404212400"},{"name":"Li Yu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, HangZhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275541400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7137646","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":902},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Linear matrix inequalities","Noise","Estimation error","Data compression","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","distributed control","H\u221e control","Lyapunov methods","matrix algebra","networked control systems","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fusion estimator gains","matrix analysis approach","Lyapunov theory","convex optimization","communication capacity","stochastic model","communication cost reduction","data compression strategy","NMFS","networked multisensor fusion system","distributed mixed H2-H\u221e fusion estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked multi-sensor fusion systems (NMFSs)","Distributed mixed H2=H\u221e fusion estimation","Limited communication capacity","Convex optimization"]},{"kwd":["Convex optimization","distributed mixed $H_{2}/H_{\\infty}$ fusion estimation","limited communication capacity","networked multi-sensor fusion systems (NMFSs)"]}],"abstract":"This technical note studies the problem of distributed fusion estimation for a class of networked multi-sensor fusion systems (NMFSs) with limited communication capacity and affected by sensor noises and disturbances.

To obtain a reliable similarity measurement between images, manually annotating a large amount of pairwise cross-camera-view person images is deemed necessary. However, this kind of annotation is both costly and impractical for efficiently deploying a Re-ID system to a completely new scenario, a new setting of nonoverlapping camera views between which person images are to be matched. To solve this problem, we consider utilizing other existing person images captured in other scenarios to help the Re-ID system in a target (new) scenario, provided that a few samples are captured under the new scenario. More specifically, we tackle this problem by jointly learning the similarity measurements for Re-ID in different scenarios in an asymmetric way. To model the joint learning, we consider that the Re-ID models share certain component across tasks. A distinct consideration in our multitask modeling is to extract the discriminant shared component that reduces the cross-task data overlap in the shared latent space during the joint learning, so as to enhance the target inter-class separation in the shared latent space. For this purpose, we propose to maximize the cross-task data discrepancy on the shared component during asymmetric multitask learning (MTL), along with maximizing the local inter-class variation and minimizing local intra-class variation on all tasks. We call our proposed method the constrained asymmetric multitask discriminant component analysis (cAMT-DCA). We show that cAMT-DCA can be solved by a simple eigen decomposition with a closed form, getting rid of any iterative learning used in most conventional MTL analyses.

However, in the case of wide-scale penetration of single-phase PV systems in the distributed grid, disconnection under grid faults can contribute to 1) voltage flickers, 2) power outages, and 3) system instability. This article explores grid code modifications for a wide-scale adoption of PV systems in the distribution grid. In addition, based on the fact that Italy and Japan have recently undertaken a major review of standards for PV power conversion systems connected to low-voltage networks, the importance of low voltage ride-through (LVRT) for single-phase PV power systems under grid faults is considered, along with three reactive power injection strategies. Simulations are presented for a PV power system with a LVRT capability and ancillary services. An example of a full-bridge single-phase grid connected system is tested experimentally to demonstrate the potential benefits. Additionally, grid codes for advanced PV systems with the discussed features are summarized.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137649/","volume":"21","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7137649/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15359505","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wide-Scale Adoption of Photovoltaic Energy: Grid Code Modifications Are Explored in the Distribution Grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-Scale Adoption of Photovoltaic Energy: Grid Code Modifications Are Explored in the Distribution Grid","sourcePdf":"21mias05-yang-2345837-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163347S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"2943","isNumber":"7181763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"7181763","articleId":"7137649","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7137650,"authors":[{"name":"Xingqin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ericsson Research, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7240139/7137650/lin-2450215_print-small.gif","p":["\nXingqin Lin received the B.Eng. degree in electronic information engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2009; the M.Phil. degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2011; and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), Austin, TX, USA, in 2014.

Nodes in the network have different notions of timing; therefore, from the viewpoint of a typical receiver, the received signals from different transmitters are asynchronous, leading to a loss of orthogonality between subcarriers. We first develop a detailed link-level analysis based on OFDM, based on which we propose a tractable system-level signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model for asynchronous OFDM networks. The proposed model is used to analytically characterize several important statistics in asynchronous networks with spatially distributed transmitters, including: (i) the number of decodable transmitters; (ii) the decoding probability of the nearest transmitter; and (iii) the system throughput. The system-level loss from lack of synchronization is quantified, and to mitigate the loss, we compare and discuss four possible solutions including extended cyclic prefix, advanced receiver timing, dynamic receiver timing positioning, and semi-static receiver timing positioning with multiple timing hypotheses. The model and results are general, and apply to ad hoc networks, cellular systems, and neighbor discovery in device-to-device (D2D) networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7240139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2450215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7240139/07137650.pdf","startPage":"3377","endPage":"3390","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2450215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Asynchronous Multicarrier Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Asynchronous Multicarrier Wireless Networks","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7137650/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432809","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Asynchronous Multicarrier Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-andrews-2450215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107868S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7240139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7240139","articleId":"7137650","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7137651,"authors":[{"name":"Jiao Wang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7484221/7137651/jwang-2450176-small.gif","p":["Jiao Wang received the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2006.","He is an Associate Professor with College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University.

Moreover, the accuracy and speed of Kinect are limited for certain applications. To boost the performance of Kinect while preserving its advantages, we have proposed a depth acquisition method that uses speckle patterns generated by commodity laser emitters as in Kinect, but the speckle density is modulated to allow higher accuracy depth measurement. In this paper, we present the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) design and implementation for the above Kinectlike depth sensing. To achieve a high-speed performance on a normal FPGA (Altera Stratix III EP3SL150), we elaborate the hardware architecture to realize a full-pipeline framework for the two main modules: 1) pixel-wise phase generation and 2) normalized cross-correlation-based phase unwrapping. Experiments show a reconstruction speed of 572 fps at a resolution of 640 \u00d7 480 with improved depth accuracy over Kinect and that an even higher resolution is supported. The previous pattern design and the FPGA design in this paper jointly demonstrate the feasibility of next-generation fast, accurate, and low-cost depth sensors.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7484221/07137651.pdf","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2450176","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2450176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Design and Implementation of Kinect-Like Depth Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Design and Implementation of Kinect-Like Depth Sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137651/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7137651/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16055195","volume":"26","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61425026 and 61370153"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Design and Implementation of Kinect-Like Depth Sensing","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-xiong-2450176-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11235S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7484221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7484221","articleId":"7137651","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7137657,"authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

On-chip memory requirements increase with image width and dominate the resources of state-of-the-art CCA single-pass hardware architectures. A reduction in on-chip memory resources is essential to meet the ever increasing image sizes of high-definition (HD) and ultra-HD standards. The proposed architecture is resource efficient due to several innovations. An improved label recycling scheme detects the last pixel of an image object in the video stream only a few clock cycles after its occurrence, allowing the reuse of a label in the following image row. The coordinated application of these techniques leads to significant memory savings of more than two orders in magnitude compared with classical two-pass connected component labeling architectures. Compared with the most memory-efficient state-of-the-art single-pass CCA hardware architecture, 42% or more of on-chip memory resources are saved depending on the features extracted. Based on these savings, it is possible to realize an architecture processing video streams of larger images sizes, or to use a smaller and more energy-efficient field-programmable gate array device, or to increase the functionality of already existing image processing pipelines in reconfigurable computing and embedded systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2450371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7506358/07137657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2450371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7506358","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resource-Efficient Hardware Architecture for Connected Component Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7137657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Resource-Efficient Hardware Architecture for Connected Component Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137657/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16139489","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7137657/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resource-Efficient Hardware Architecture for Connected Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-klaiber-2450371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152385S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7506358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7506358","articleId":"7137657","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7137659,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Zhang is currently a Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.

In such case, the system reactive power sharing error cannot be easily evaluated and eliminated. So, this paper proposes a wireless control strategy that employs optimized virtual impedance controllers and local load measurements for the reactive power sharing in networked microgrid. First, from the modeling of microgrid network, an estimation method for network reactive power sharing error is derived. Through the estimation method-based network feature analyses, corresponding design for virtual impedance controller is presented. Then, by introducing genetic algorithm, virtual impedance controller parameters of each distributed generation unit are optimized, which aims to minimize the microgrid global reactive power sharing error. The parameter optimization process is performed offline in microgrid configuration stage. By using these optimized virtual impedance controllers, the reactive power sharing performance of a networked microgird can be greatly improved. Finally, the accuracy of the estimation method is validated by MATLAB simulation results, and the feasibility of the proposed virtual impedance optimization method is verified through real power experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137660/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7137660/","accessionNumber":"15618474","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Virtual Impedance Optimization Method for Reactive Power Sharing in Networked Microgrid","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-tech Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2015AA050606"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51177130"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Virtual Impedance Optimization Method for Reactive Power Sharing in Networked Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhu-2450360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13386S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7339495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"7339495","articleId":"7137660","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7137662,"authors":[{"name":"Bidong Liu","affiliation":["Energy Production and Infrastructure Center, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Bidong Liu received the B.S. degree in resource and environmental science from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2007, and the Master of Economics degree from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA, in 2008.

In the smart grid era, the electricity demand is more active and less predictable than ever before. As a result, probabilistic load forecasting, which provides additional information on the variability and uncertainty of future load values, is becoming of great importance to power systems planning and operations. This paper proposes a practical methodology to generate probabilistic load forecasts by performing quantile regression averaging on a set of sister point forecasts. There are two major benefits of the proposed approach. It can leverage the development in the point load forecasting literature over the past several decades and it does not rely so much on high-quality expert forecasts, which are rarely achievable in load forecasting practice. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and make the results reproducible to the load forecasting community, we construct a case study using the publicly available data from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014.

Refocused 3D contents can be rendered from light field images. A method for capturing these images is using cameras with microlens arrays. A dense sampling of the light field results in large amounts of redundant data. Therefore, an efficient compression is vital for a practical use of these data. In this paper, we propose a displacement intra prediction scheme with a maximum of two hypotheses for the compression of plenoptic contents from focused plenoptic cameras. The proposed scheme is further implemented into High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). The work is aiming at efficiently coding plenoptic captured contents without knowing underlying camera geometries. In addition, the theoretical analysis of the displacement intra prediction for plenoptic images is explained; the relationship between the compressed captured images and their rendered quality is also analyzed. Evaluation results show that plenoptic contents can be efficiently compressed by the proposed scheme. Bit rate reduction up to 60% over HEVC is obtained for plenoptic images, and more than 30% is achieved for the tested video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2450333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7506358/07137669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2450333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7506358","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding of Focused Plenoptic Contents by Displacement Intra Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7137669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coding of Focused Plenoptic Contents by Displacement Intra Prediction","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16139477","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7137669/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Knowledge Foundation, Sweden","grantNumber":"20120328"},{"fundingName":"EU European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"00156702"},{"fundingName":"Mellersta Norrland, Sweden"},{"fundingName":"L\u00e4nsstyrelsen V\u00e4sternorrland, Sweden","grantNumber":"00155148"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding of Focused Plenoptic Contents by Displacement Intra Prediction","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-li-2450333-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11223S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7506358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7506358","articleId":"7137669","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":7137672,"authors":[{"name":"Ken-Fu Liang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7177154/7137672/7137672-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ken-Fu Liang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2013.","From August to November 2013, he was with the Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering as a Full-Time Research Assistant.

One of the key enablers for this adoption is the device-to-device (D2D) communications, where mobile devices can connect directly between each other, without the need for a base station (BS) nor a switching core to handle and route the traffic. This feature is a vital communication backup in case of a network infrastructure failure or a natural disaster. In this paper, we analytically quantify the cellular network performance during massive infrastructure failure, where some terminals can play the role of low-power relay nodes forming multihop communication links to assist farther terminals outside the reach of the healthy network coverage. Namely, we analytically determine the D2D effect in alleviating the damage caused by the disaster. This paper is based on stochastic geometry analysis and presents a novel analytical methodology that is applicable to wide scenarios of network conditions and parameters.

In this paper, we propose a new framework, called GenFin, which is, as far as we know, the first to target the multiobjective yield optimization of logic circuits. Since FinFETs are a promising substitute for CMOS at 22-nm technology node and beyond, we evaluate the framework with a 22-nm FinFET logic library. By combining the power of genetic algorithm (GA) and adaptive multiobjective optimization, GenFin produces a set of nondominated logic circuits whose timing, leakage power, and dynamic power yields are simultaneously optimized. This can help designers make tradeoff decisions wisely and avoid suboptimal solutions. We also propose an incremental statistical circuit analyzer, called incremental FinPrin, that speeds up the statistical static timing analysis by up to 9.6\u00d7 and the statistical power analysis by up to 2235.7\u00d7, while incurring errors of only up to 0.031% in mean and 0.74% in standard deviation relative to nonincremental analysis. We use heuristics based on the deterministic timing analysis and gate criticality to reduce the GA search space and also improve the quality of its solutions. We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of GenFin.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2442260","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7416268/07137682.pdf","startPage":"1126","endPage":"1139","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2442260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GenFin: Genetic Algorithm-Based Multiobjective Statistical Logic Circuit Optimization Using Incremental Statistical Analysis","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/7416268/7137682-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"GenFin: Genetic Algorithm-Based Multiobjective Statistical Logic Circuit Optimization Using Incremental Statistical Analysis","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15803144","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7137682/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1318603"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"GenFin: Genetic Algorithm-Based Multiobjective Statistical Logic Circuit Optimization Using Incremental Statistical Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-tang-2442260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133698S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7416268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7416268","articleId":"7137682","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7137685,"authors":[{"name":"Xuanyao Fong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7416268/7137685/fong-2439733-small.gif","p":["Xuanyao Fong (S\u201906) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2006 and 2014, respectively.","He was an Intern Engineer with the Boston Design Center, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Boxborough, MA, USA, in 2007.

RAM and ROM data, which can be different, are stored in the same bitcell and the ROM capacity may be as large as the RAM capacity. Furthermore, our proposed ROM-embedding technique is applicable to any resistive memory technology in which the bit-cell topology is identical to that of the STT-MRAM bit-cell. An additional sense amplifier is required in the peripheral circuitry, hence we propose an area-optimized peripheral circuitry to minimize the total area penalty of embedding ROM. Our analysis reveals that the ROM may be embedded in the STT-MRAM array without area overhead and without any penalty in the performance of the memory as RAM. Furthermore, our simulations show that the embedded ROM may be used to accelerate applications that use lookup tables with as much as 30% improvement in instructions per cycle of a processor using ROM-embedded STT-MRAM for its L2 cache.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Read only memory","Random access memory","Sensors","System-on-chip","Magnetic tunneling","Magnetization","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","embedded systems","MRAM devices","read-only storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip caches","lookup tables","area-optimized peripheral circuitry","sense amplifier","bit-cell topology","resistive memory technology","ROM-embedding technique","RAM capacity","ROM capacity","bit-line","STT-MRAM arrays","spin-transfer torque MRAM arrays","read-only memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerating function evaluation","cache memories","emerging technologies","magnetic RAM","nonvolatile RAM","read-only memory (ROM)","ROM-embedded spin-transfer torque (STT)-MRAM (R-MRAM)","simulation","STT-MRAM."]},{"kwd":["Accelerating function evaluation","cache memories","emerging technologies","magnetic RAM","nonvolatile RAM","read-only memory (ROM)","ROM-embedded spin-transfer torque (STT)-MRAM (R-MRAM)","simulation","STT-MRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7137685","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2439733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7416268/07137685.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2439733","startPage":"992","endPage":"1002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedding Read-Only Memory in Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM-Based On-Chip Caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Embedding Read-Only Memory in Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM-Based On-Chip Caches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137685/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7137685/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15803122","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"STARnet, a Semiconductor Research Corporation Program through MARCO and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":"Intel Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedding Read-Only Memory in Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM-Based On-Chip Caches","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-fong-2439733-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084358S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7416268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7416268","articleId":"7137685","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7137689,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Bao","affiliation":["The Edward S.

The secondary network under consideration is equipped with multiple correlated antennas at the source, the relay, and the destination. On the other hand, the primary network is composed of L primary users (PUs), each of which is equipped with multiple correlated antennas. For the considered underlay spectrum sharing, the transmit power condition is related by an interference limit on the primary network and the maximum transmission power in the secondary network. In particular, new exact expressions for the outage probability of the adopted system models are obtained. Moreover, simple asymptotic expressions for the outage probability are provided to enable the characterization of the achievable diversity orders and coding gains. To enhance the secondary network performance, optimal power allocation (PA) between the secondary source and the secondary relay is obtained based on the asymptotic outage probability under the constraints of total allowable transmit power at the secondary user (SU) and maximum allowable interference power limit at the PU. The derived analytical formulas herein are supported by numerical results to clarify the main contributions.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2450363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07137690.pdf","startPage":"5349","endPage":"5363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2450363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Cognitive Relay Networks With Correlated Antennas Over Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7137690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7137690/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Cognitive Relay Networks With Correlated Antennas Over Rayleigh Fading Channels","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141176","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7137690/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"3-039-2-010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Cognitive Relay Networks With Correlated Antennas Over Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-abdelmalek-2450363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178725S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7137690","onlineDate":"26 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7137691,"authors":[{"name":"Daekeun Yoon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Daekeun","lastName":"Yoon","id":"38554959700"},{"name":"Jongwon Yun","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jongwon","lastName":"Yun","id":"38240378200"},{"name":"Jae-Sung Rieh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Sung","lastName":"Rieh","id":"37268940300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-342X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-3446"}],"articleNumber":"7137691","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1004},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7137691","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Tuning","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Inductance","Frequency measurement","Capacitors","Indium phosphide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit tuning","coupled circuits","heterojunction bipolar transistors","low-power electronics","submillimetre wave oscillators","terahertz wave devices","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled-line voltage-controlled oscillator","terahertz voltage-controlled oscillator","InP heterojunction bipolar transistor technology","cross-coupled push-push oscillator","coupled-line topology","base bias tuning","oscillation frequency tuning","voltage tuning","dc power consumption","frequency 310 GHz to 340 GHz","size 0.25 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency control","heterjunction bipolar transistor (HBT)","voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs)"]}],"abstract":"A THz voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) has been developed in this work based on a 0.25- \u03bcm InP heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) technology.

Considerations for Single-Phase Line Frequency Transformers Applied at Photovoltaic Systems","abstract":"The issue of dc current injection at low voltage autonomous or interconnected grids as a result of photovoltaic (PV) systems integration is thoroughly discussed in this paper. This paper focuses on the sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation inverter with a low-frequency step-up transformer, as this was widely used in the past at PV grid connected applications, while nowadays, it is a favorable solution in standalone multisource residential applications. This paper highlights the fact that dc current injection is possible even at the presence of a low-frequency transformer. In addition, the impact of the dc current flow on the transformer efficiency is studied, and appropriate design considerations are extracted-thus limiting the dc current component in an efficient manner. The proposed design considerations are validated through experimental results accomplished on laboratory and commercial PV power conversion products.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","volume":"2","issue":"3","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15475633","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138564/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design Considerations for Single-Phase Line Frequency Transformers Applied at Photovoltaic Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Program DGRES within the Research Activity ARCHIMEDES III, through the National Stronger Regions Fund 2007-2013, Greece","grantNumber":"MIS 380360"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Design Considerations for Single-Phase Line Frequency Transformers Applied at Photovoltaic Systems","sourcePdf":"jpets-papanikolaou-2433391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146695S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687318","isNumber":"7277183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687318","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7277183","articleId":"7138564","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7138565,"authors":[{"name":"Shaista Jabeen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota, United States"],"firstName":"Shaista","lastName":"Jabeen","id":"37085722983"},{"name":"Sudarshan K.

A popular trend is the use of FPGA-based digital control for stepper motors. We present a formal verification methodology for 6 types of stepper motor (SM) control. Our methodology is based on the theory of Well-Founded Equivalence Bisimulation refinement , where both formal specifications and implementations are treated as transition systems. We define formal specifications for six types of Stepper Motor control. We also develop correctness proof obligations for FPGA implementations of stepper motor control. The methods are demonstrated using six case studies. The specifications are simple, with less than 50 transitions.

This practice assumes that there is an FEC code that will reduce the BER after decoding to the desired level. In this paper, we challenge this practice and show that the concept of a channel-independent FEC limit is invalid for soft-decision bit-wise decoding. It is shown that for low code rates and high-order modulation formats, the use of the soft-decision FEC limit paradigm can underestimate the spectral efficiencies by up to 20%. A better predictor for the BER after decoding is the generalized mutual information, which is shown to give consistent post-FEC BER predictions across different channel conditions and modulation formats. Extensive optical full-field simulations and experiments are carried out in both the linear and nonlinear transmission regimes to confirm the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2450537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2450537","startPage":"4338","endPage":"4352","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7258411/07138570.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Replacing the Soft-Decision FEC Limit Paradigm in the Design of Optical Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15, 15 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Replacing the Soft-Decision FEC Limit Paradigm in the Design of Optical Communication Systems","volume":"33","issue":"20","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15439834","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"15 Oct.15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7138570/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/J017582/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001862","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council (VR)","grantNumber":"2012-5280"},{"fundingName":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Replacing the Soft-Decision FEC Limit Paradigm in the Design of Optical Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-alvarado-2450537-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.186791S","chronDate":"Oct.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7258411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"7258411","articleId":"7138570","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7138573,"authors":[{"name":"Raquel Guti\u00e9rrez-Rivas","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Alcal\u00e1, Madrid, Spain","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7181761/7138573/gutie-2450773-small.gif","p":["Raquel Guti\u00e9rrez-Rivas (S\u201914) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees from the University of Alcal\u00e1, Spain, in 2011 and 2012, respectively.","She has been working on different research projects with the Electronics Department, University of Alcal\u00e1, since 2009.

The proposed algorithm copes at the same time with both requirements: 1) accuracy and 2) low resource consumption. In this paper, a real-time QRS complex detector is proposed. This algorithm is based on a differentiation at the pre-processing stage combined with a dynamic threshold to detect R peaks. The thresholding stage is based on a finite-state machine, which modifies the threshold value according to the evolution of the signal and the previously detected peak. It has been evaluated on several databases, including the standard ones, thus resulting sensitivities and positive predictivities better than 99.3%. In order to analyze the computational complexity of the algorithm, it has been compared with the well-known Pan and Tompkins' algorithm. As a result, the proposed detector achieves a reduction in processing time of almost 50% by using only the 25% of hardware resources (memory, adders, and multipliers).","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2450773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7181761/07138573.pdf","startPage":"6036","endPage":"6043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2450773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Real-Time Low-Complexity QRS Complex Detector Based on Adaptive Thresholding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138573/","displayDocTitle":"Novel Real-Time Low-Complexity QRS Complex Detector Based on Adaptive Thresholding","volume":"15","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15378969","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138573/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003339","fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the LORIS Project and DISSETSOC Project","grantNumber":"TIN2012-38080-C04-01 and TEC2012-38058-C03-03"},{"fundingName":"University of Alcal\u00e1 through the FPI Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Real-Time Low-Complexity QRS Complex Detector Based on Adaptive Thresholding","sourcePdf":"jsen-gutierrezrivas-2450773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102938S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7181761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"7181761","articleId":"7138573","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7138579,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085442461"},{"name":"Deli Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Deli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085439060"},{"name":"Jing Ma","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085432475"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7138579","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2421},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Block diagram of the tunable virtual optical local oscillator coherent OFDM system over FSO links with Gamma\u2013Gamma channel.

The mapping mode of the OFDM signal uses 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with better performance. On this basis, we derived the closed form of the symbol error rate and interrupt probability, respectively. In this paper, we analyzed under the premise of the different number of subcarriers, the influence of each parameter of atmospheric channel on the bit error, and the communication interrupt performance of the OFDM-FSO system, respectively. The results show that the coherent OFDM-FSO system can obtain higher sensitivity and can overcome the bad atmosphere influence to obtain good performance of the system.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2450532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7128802/07138579.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2450532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7128802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Coherent OFDM Systems in Free-Space Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Coherent OFDM Systems in Free-Space Optical Communications","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"externalId":"7902410","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15302078","htmlLink":"/document/7138579/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering (Shanghai Jiao Tong University)","grantNumber":"1418"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M 540290"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379027"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Performance of Coherent OFDM Systems in Free-Space Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"jphot-wang-2450532-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06238S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7128802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7128802","articleId":"7138579","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7138584,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzhou Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7240139/7138584/yli-2450724_print-small.gif","p":["\nYuzhou Li received the B.Eng. degree in electronic and information engineering from the College of Electronic Science & Engineering at Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2009.

In this paper, we investigate a max-min energy efficiency-optimal problem (MEP) to ensure fairness among links in terms of energy efficiency in OFDMA systems. In particular, we maximize the energy efficiency of the worst-case link subject to the rate requirements, transmit power, and subcarrier assignment constraints. Due to the nonsmooth and mixed combinatorial features of the formulation, we focus on low-complexity suboptimal algorithms design. Using a generalized fractional programming theory and the Lagrangian dual decomposition, we first propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem. We then devise algorithms to separate the subcarrier assignment and power allocation to further reduce the computational cost. Our simulation results verify the convergence performance and the fairness achieved among links, and particularly reveal a new tradeoff between the network energy efficiency and fairness by comparing the MEP with the existing

control scheme is proposed for multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) cascade nonlinear systems with unknown external disturbance and input saturation. To efficiently observe unknown external disturbance, a novel sliding mode disturbance observer (SMDO) with finite time convergence performance is presented. A robust constrained control scheme is developed for MIMO nonlinear systems based on backstepping control techniques and the disturbance estimate of the SMDO. With the first-order sliding mode differentiator introduced to compute the derivatives of virtual control laws, the computational burden in backstepping control is reduced for a MIMO cascade nonlinear system.

First, we propose a new smooth inverse model which can approximate the asymmetric actuator backlash arbitrarily. By applying it, two adaptive fuzzy control scenarios, namely, the compensation-based control scheme and nonlinear decomposition-based control scheme, are then developed successively. It is worth noticing that the first fuzzy controller exhibits a better tracking control performance, although it recourses to a known slope ratio of backlash nonlinearity. The second one further removes the restriction, and also gets a desirable control performance. By the strict Lyapunov argument, both adaptive fuzzy controllers guarantee that the output tracking error is convergent to an adjustable region of zero asymptotically, while all the signals remain semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Lastly, two comparative simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy controllers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Tracking Control of Nonlinear Systems

Then, the stabilization condition under such MDADT switching signals is established for the switched nonlinear systems with possibly all unstable subsystems. By proposing a class of time-scheduled multiple quadratic Lyapunov function and applying T-S fuzzy models to represent the underlying nonlinear subsystems, numerically easily verified stabilization conditions are further derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities.

The proposed approach is intended to overcome the shortcomings of existing SR over an exemplar dictionary-based SV systems. In this paper, the supervectors created by concatenating the mean vectors of adapted Gaussian mixture models are used as speaker representations. Both simple and discriminative methods are explored for learning the dictionary in the supervector domain. The learned dictionary-based approach is further extended to enable the compensation of the session/channel variability by using a joint sparse coding over speaker and channel dictionaries. The proposed systems are evaluated on the NIST 2012 SRE data set and are contrasted with the state-of-the-art i-vector probabilistic linear discriminant analysis-based SV system. The proposed system is found to possess the following attributes: 1) a significantly higher performance for very low-false alarm rates, which makes the system attractive for high-security applications; 2) a higher robustness to the short duration test data condition; 3) a competitive robustness to additive noise in test data; and 4) a much lower computational complexity. Even on comparing with the fastest i-vector computation methods reported in the literature, the complexity of the proposed system is found to be comparable. With these features, the proposed approach seems to be a promising candidate for practical voice biometric applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biometrics","Verification","Classification","Dictionaries","Encoding","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Gaussian processes","mixture models","signal representation","speaker recognition","speech coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint sparse coding","speaker verification","sparse representation","learned dictionary","SR","mean vector concatenation","adapted Gaussian mixture models","speaker representations","session-channel variability","NIST 2012 SRE data set","i-vector probabilistic linear discriminant analysis-based SV system","false alarm rates","additive noise","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voice biometrics","speaker verification","GMM supervector","sparse representation classification","learned dictionary"]},{"kwd":["Voice biometrics","speaker verification","GMM supervector","sparse representation classification","learned dictionary"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2450674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7181762/07138605.pdf","startPage":"2143","endPage":"2157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2450674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Speaker Verification With Joint Sparse Coding Over Learned Dictionaries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Speaker Verification With Joint Sparse Coding Over Learned Dictionaries","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138605/","volume":"10","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138605/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15359380","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Speaker Verification With Joint Sparse Coding Over Learned Dictionaries","sourcePdf":"tifs-bc-2450674-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110747S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7181762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7181762","articleId":"7138605","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7138611,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Qiu","affiliation":["NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/7442915/7138611/qiu-2433672-small.gif","p":["Xin Qiu received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2012.

The main innovation of this paper is the simultaneous use of individuals across generations from an objective-based perspective. Good convergence-diversity tradeoff and satisfactory exploration-exploitation balance are achieved via the hybrid cross-generation mutation operation. Furthermore, the cross-generation adaptation mechanism enables the individuals to self-adapt their associated parameters not only optimization stage-wise but also objective-space-wise.

In this paper, we quantify by theoretical means the resistance of the least complex form of this kind of encoding against known-plaintext attacks. For both standard CS with antipodal random matrices and recent multiclass encryption schemes based on it, we show how the number of candidate encoding matrices that match a typical plaintext-ciphertext pair is so large that the search for the true encoding matrix inconclusive. Such results on the practical ineffectiveness of known-plaintext attacks underlie the fact that even closely related signal recovery under encoding matrix uncertainty is doomed to fail. Practical attacks are then exemplified by applying CS with antipodal random matrices as a multiclass encryption scheme to signals such as images and electrocardiographic tracks, showing that the extracted information on the true encoding matrix from a plaintext-ciphertext pair leads to no significant signal recovery quality increase. This theoretical and empirical evidence clarifies that, although not perfectly secure, both standard CS and multiclass encryption schemes feature a noteworthy level of security against known-plaintext attacks, therefore increasing its appeal as a negligible-cost encryption method for resource-limited sensing applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2450676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7181762/07138616.pdf","startPage":"2182","endPage":"2195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2450676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Known-Plaintext Attacks to a Compressed Sensing-Based Encryption: A Quantitative Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138616/","displayDocTitle":"On Known-Plaintext Attacks to a Compressed Sensing-Based Encryption: A Quantitative Analysis","volume":"10","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15397671","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138616/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Known-Plaintext Attacks to a Compressed Sensing-Based Encryption: A Quantitative Analysis","sourcePdf":"tifs-cambareri-2450676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130231S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7181762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7181762","articleId":"7138616","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7138619,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Alahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Taibah University, Medina, Saudi Arabia","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7181762/7138619/alahm-2450673-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Alahmadi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Taibah University, Madina, Saudi Arabia, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.

The digital TV (DTV) model adopted is the second generation terrestrial digital television standard (DVB-T2). In this paper, first, we propose an efficient advanced encryption standard (AES)-based DTV scheme, where the existing reference sequence used to generate the P2 pilot symbols in the DVB-T2 frames is encrypted using the AES algorithm to facilitate accurate primary user and malicious user detection. With the proposed scheme, we can detect PUEA accurately over all subcarriers or subbands where the P2 symbols present. Second, we come up with an effective communication scheme for the secondary users (SUs) under PUEA by exploiting the energy harvesting techniques. Optimal power splitting is considered for sum-rate maximization. As the optimal solution relies on multidimensional exhaustive search, we propose an effective suboptimal solution with much lower computational complexity. It is observed that the sum-rate of the SU network can be improved significantly with the energy harvesting technique. Third, we evaluate the worst case PUEA interference in terms of minimizing the sum-rate for the SUs. We show that for practical systems, as channel state information among the SUs is not available to the malicious user, the worst jamming for the SUs is when the malicious user performs equal power allocation over all the white space subcarriers. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the proposed approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7181762/07138619.pdf","startPage":"2131","endPage":"2142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2450673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2450673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband PUEA Detection and Mitigation in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Receivers","Digital TV","Digital video broadcasting","Standards","Interference","Jamming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","digital video broadcasting","energy harvesting","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PUEA detection","OFDM","malicious user detection","energy harvesting","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based cognitive radio networks","primary user emulation attack","digital TV model","second generation terrestrial digital television standard","DVB-T2","advanced encryption standard","secondary users","power splitting","sum-rate maximization","computational complexity","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","primary user emulation","attack","energy harvesting","wireless security"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","primary user emulation attack","energy harvesting","wireless security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Subband PUEA Detection and Mitigation in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7138619/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15359376","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1117831, CNS-1217206 and ECCS-1232109"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401400"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband PUEA Detection and Mitigation in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-alahmadi-2450673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.289542S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7181762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7181762","articleId":"7138619","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7138629,"authors":[{"name":"David Bouget","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Rennes 1 LTSI, Medicis team.

The salient features of a WANET are Rayleigh fading, constant power transmission, pure ALOHA as the channel access protocol, and the nodes being modeled by a homogeneous space-time Poisson point process. For such a WANET, this paper quantifies the rate density (RD) and the dynamic variations of the packet transmission time by deriving an upper bound on the CCDF of the packet transmission time. The performance of rateless codes is compared with two benchmarks, i.e., the ergodic RD (ERD) and the RD of fixed-rate codes. The proposed rateless coding scheme does not require time diversity as each packet is transmitted within a single coherence time. Yet, it is shown that the RD can be up to 76% and 50% of the ERD in noise- and interference-limited regimes, respectively. Thus, the presented network nearly achieves the ERD while requiring significantly shorter delays. This paper shows that a low-complexity Gaussian receiver with a nearest neighbor decoder has almost the performance of an ideal matched receiver. We also show that power control in the form of channel thresholding leads to a 72% gain in the RD relative to a constant power transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Rateless Codes in an ALOHA Wireless Ad Hoc Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2450716","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7321101/07138632.pdf","startPage":"6216","endPage":"6229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2450716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138632/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Rateless Codes in an ALOHA Wireless Ad Hoc Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7138632/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583887","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Rateless Codes in an ALOHA Wireless Ad Hoc Network","sourcePdf":"twc-rajanna-2450716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089501S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7321101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7321101","articleId":"7138632","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7138634,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed Signal, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37406127300"},{"name":"Chi-Hang Chan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed Signal, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Hang","lastName":"Chan","id":"37406799000"},{"name":"Si-Seng Wong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed Signal, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Si-Seng","lastName":"Wong","id":"37401916800"},{"name":"U Seng-Pan","affiliation":["Synopsys Macau Ltd., Macau, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"U","lastName":"Seng-Pan","id":"38272449500"},{"name":"Rui Paulo Martins","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico/Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Rui Paulo","lastName":"Martins","id":"37085335862"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"7138634","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1603},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Arrays","Capacitors","Linearity","Histograms","Capacitance","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","calibration","digital-analogue conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["histogram-based ratio mismatch calibration","digital-to-analog converter","bridge-DAC","successive approximation register","SAR","analog-to-digital converter","ADC","conversion nonlinearity","HBRM","behavioral simulations","signal-to-noise distortion ratio","word length 12 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bridge DAC","linearity calibration","SAR ADC."]},{"kwd":["Bridge DAC","linearity calibration","SAR ADC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138634","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7416268/07138634.pdf","startPage":"1203","endPage":"1207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2442258","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2442258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histogram-Based Ratio Mismatch Calibration for Bridge-DAC in 12-bit 120 MS/s SAR ADC","abstract":"This brief reports a 120 MS/s 12-bit successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

Several multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) MAC protocols have recently been proposed to allow concurrent transmissions across different links. Though those protocols better utilize the available degrees of freedom, they however do not provide each data stream any receive diversity. This paper introduces multiplexing-diversity medium access (MDMA), a distributed MU-MIMO MAC protocol that achieves both the multiplexing and receive diversity gains at the same time. Instead of letting a node pair use its full degrees of freedom, MDMA allows as many contending node pairs as possible to transmit concurrently and share all the available degrees of freedom. By doing this, MDMA exploits more antennas equipped at different receiving nodes to provide concurrent streams more receive diversity, without sacrificing the multiplexing gain. We show via testbed experiments and simulations that MDMA achieves a similar multiplexing gain, but extracts more diversity gains as the number of antennas at any nodes increases. It hence improves the throughput by up to 48.8 percent as compared to the protocol enabling only spatial multiplexing.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2450744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7445928/07138638.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2450744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7445928","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplexing-Diversity Medium Access for Multi-User MIMO Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiplexing-Diversity Medium Access for Multi-User MIMO Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 May 2016","accessionNumber":"15887686","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7138638/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"MOST","grantNumber":"102-2221-E-001-012-MY2 and 103-2221-E-001-017-MY2"},{"fundingName":"Sinica thematic project","grantNumber":"AS-104-TP-A05"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"MOST","grantNumber":"103-2221-E-002-086-MY3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004725","fundingName":"MOEA","grantNumber":"103-EC-17-A-03-S1-214"},{"fundingName":"Advanced Wireless Broadband System and Inter-networking Application Technology Development Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiplexing-Diversity Medium Access for Multi-User MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-lin-2450744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099275S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7445928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7445928","articleId":"7138638","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7138640,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o In\u00e1cio Yutaka Ota","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7339495/7138640/ota-small.gif","p":["Jo\u00e3o In\u00e1cio Yutaka Ota was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil,\n in 1985.

The SSBC-based BESS produces three-phase multilevel voltage waveforms, and eliminates both harmonic filters and a complicated zig-zag transformer from the ac side. The circuit modularity of the SSBC enables the usage of multiple individual low-voltage battery modules. Along with control strategy based on zero-sequence-voltage injection, this modularity enhances the availability and flexibility of the BESS. A three-phase laboratory downscaled system rated at 140 V, 10 kW, and 21 kW\u00b7h is designed, constructed, and tested to verify the operating principles and performance. The tested BESS produces a current total harmonic distortion (THD) of 3.0% even when it operates with different active-power commands for individual bridge cells. In addition, zero-voltage ride-through capability is verified for the severest single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase voltage sags. Mathematical analysis and experimental verification validate the downscaled system and performance, making the BESS prospective.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2450757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"2791","endPage":"2799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2450757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7339495","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7339495/07138640.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Bridge circuits","Pulse width modulation","Power system stability","Switches","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery management systems","bridge circuits","harmonic distortion","power convertors","power supply quality","waveform generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery energy storage system","BESS","modular multilevel cascaded converter","single-star bridge cell","MMCC","SSBC","three phase multilevel voltage waveform generation","circuit modularity","low-voltage battery module","zero sequence voltage injection","three-phase laboratory downscaled system","total harmonic distortion","THD","zero voltage ride-through capability","voltage sags","voltage 140 V","power 10 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery energy storage systems","cascade connections","modular multilevel cascade converters","phase-shifted-carrier PWM","zero-voltage-ride-through (ZVRT) capability"]},{"kwd":["Battery energy storage systems (BESSs)","cascade connections","modular multilevel cascade converters (MMCC)","phase-shifted-carrier pulsewidth modulation (PWM)","zero-voltage-ride-through (ZVRT) capability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of Performance, Availability, and Flexibility of a Battery Energy Storage System Based on a Modular Multilevel Cascaded Converter (MMCC-SSBC)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138640/","volume":"31","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7138640/","accessionNumber":"15618461","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2015","publicationDate":"April 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research (A)","grantNumber":"21246045"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of Performance, Availability, and Flexibility of a Battery Energy Storage System Based on a Modular Multilevel Cascaded Converter (MMCC-SSBC)","sourcePdf":"tpel-akagi-2450757-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072196S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7339495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"7339495","articleId":"7138640","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7138647,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7469422/7138647/fwang-2450774-small.gif","p":["\n\nFang Wang received the B.S. degree in electronics and information \nengineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2010.

Resource allocation for D2D communications, which occupies nonorthogonal channels with cellular transmissions, is an important problem in terms of achieving the aforementioned benefits. In this problem, there are two fundamental challenges to be addressed: 1) how to emulate cellular users to share their resources and 2) how to efficiently allocate resources in terms of channels for D2D pairs. In this paper, we exploit social ties in human-formed social networks to enhance D2D resource sharing and further propose a social-community-aware D2D resource allocation framework, where cellular users would like to share their channels with D2D communications in the same community formed by a group of people with close social ties. After that, we propose a two-step coalition game, where a coalition formulation is established for communities, and an optimal resource allocation problem is formulated for D2D pairs. Extensive simulations on random networks and real mobile trace verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2450774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7469422/07138647.pdf","startPage":"3628","endPage":"3640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2450774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social-Community-Aware Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlaying Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138647/","displayDocTitle":"Social-Community-Aware Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlaying Cellular Networks","volume":"65","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15988953","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138647/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271266"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142027"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Visible Light Communication System Key Laboratory","grantNumber":"ZDSYS20140512114229398"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Peacock Plan","grantNumber":"1108170036003286"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social-Community-Aware Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2450774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106468S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7469422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7469422","articleId":"7138647","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7138649,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhuo Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Rice University"],"bio":{"p":["Wenzhuo Ouyang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201914) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA, in 2014.","During his bachelor's study, he was an exchange student with System and Control Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA, in 2007.

It is well known that the performance of scheduling over fading channels relies heavily on the accuracy of the available channel state information (CSI), which is costly to acquire. Thus, we consider the CSI acquisition via a practical ARQ-based feedback mechanism whereby channel states are revealed at the end of only scheduled users' transmissions. In the assumed presence of temporally correlated channel evolutions, the desired scheduler must optimally balance the exploitation-exploration tradeoff, whereby it schedules transmissions both to exploit those channels with up-to-date CSI and to explore the current state of those with outdated CSI. In earlier works, Whittle's Index Policy had been suggested as a low-complexity and high-performance solution to this problem. However, analyzing its performance in the typical scenario of statistically heterogeneous channel state processes has remained elusive and challenging, mainly because of the highly coupled and complex dynamics it possesses. In this work, we overcome these difficulties to rigorously establish the asymptotic optimality properties of Whittle's Index Policy in the limiting regime of many users. More specifically: 1) we prove the local optimality of Whittle's Index Policy, provided that the initial state of the system is within a certain neighborhood of a carefully selected state; (2) we then establish the global optimality of Whittle's Index Policy under a recurrence assumption that is verified numerically for our problem. These results establish that Whittle's Index Policy possesses analytically provable optimality characteristics for scheduling over heterogeneous and temporally correlated channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2016","accessionNumber":"16088634","htmlLink":"/document/7138649/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Scheduling Over Markovian Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Scheduling Over Markovian Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tnet-ouyang-2438009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109688S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7491396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7491396","articleId":"7138649","onlineDate":"29 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7138729,"authors":[{"name":"Trung Anh Dinh","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Japan"],"firstName":"Trung Anh","lastName":"Dinh","id":"38666825900"},{"name":"Shigeru Yamashita","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37531840900"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37085372492"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Duke University, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37084986500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7603-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1877"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1780"}],"articleNumber":"7138729","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Layout","Reservoirs","Testing","Erbium","Schedules","Optimal scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidic biochip testing","VLSI circuit","biomedical experiment","chip defect","arbitrary chip layout","test-application time"]}],"abstract":"As in the case of VLSI circuits, digital microfluidic biochips must be adequately tested after manufacturing to guarantee the correctness of the biomedical experiments.

To keep up with the development pace of nanoscale devices, enhancement methods for yield and reliability must overcome the barriers set forth by advent of new technology. To address the issue of reliability, periodic online field test and repair are implemented by using synergistic approach of employing redundancy and ECC to repair or correct both hard errors and soft errors. In this paper, an online remap strategy for memory repair, which ensures `fresh' memory words are always used until the spare words run out, is proposed. The improvement of reliability for memory architectures and the area overhead introduced by the proposed scheme is evaluated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ECC-based memory architecture with online self-repair capabilities for reliability enhancement","doi":"10.1109/ETS.2015.7138734","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2015.7138734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138715","publicationTitle":"2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7127855/7138715/07138734.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An ECC-based memory architecture with online self-repair capabilities for reliability enhancement","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138734/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285885","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ECC-based memory architecture with online self-repair capabilities for reliability enhancement","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061853S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7127855","isNumber":"7138715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7127855","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7138715","articleId":"7138734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7138736,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Emre Araci","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, USA"],"firstName":"Ismail Emre","lastName":"Araci","id":"37085389571"},{"name":"Paul Pop","affiliation":["DTU Compute Dept., Technical University of Denmark"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Pop","id":"37278880300"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept., Duke University, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7603-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1877"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1780"}],"articleNumber":"7138736","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Valves","Testing","Circuit faults","Sensors","Mixers","Fabrication","Biomembranes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biomedical equipment","bioMEMS","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","microvalves","multiplexing equipment","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic very large-scale integration","fault-tolerant design","microfluidic biochips","biochemical analyzers","biochemical analysis","in vitro diagnostics","drug discovery","biotech","ecology","mixers","switches","multiplexers","screen defective devices","mVLSI platforms","continuous-flow microfluidics","microvalve"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138736","abstract":"Microfluidic biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analyzers by integrating all the necessary functions for biochemical analysis using microfluidics.

To cope with the increasing design complexity and the challenge of cost-efficient reliability improvement, modular and hierarchical optimizations are essential in the design space exploration. In this paper a novel scheduling and binding approach is proposed to investigate the potentials of reliability enhancement in high level synthesis. Inspired by the observation that the timing resource within individual clock cycle can be redistributed to maximize reliability, we propose a reliability-aware operation chaining technique, considering both the behavioral operation vulnerabilities and RTL reliability-cost tradeoffs in functional units. Using a characterized RTL component library regarding soft error, the experimental results show that compared to the traditional chaining, with the same timing constraint the proposed technique can generate the RTL with 3X reduction of the system failure rate, while introducing only 15% area and 16% power overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ETS.2015.7138739","publicationTitle":"2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7127855/7138715/07138739.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2015.7138739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138715","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-aware operation chaining in high level synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-aware operation chaining in high level synthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138739/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285854","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7138739/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-aware operation chaining in high level synthesis","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068127S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7127855","isNumber":"7138715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7127855","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7138715","articleId":"7138739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7138747,"authors":[{"name":"Yiorgos Sfikas","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Sfikas","id":"37320311000"},{"name":"Yiorgos Tsiatouhas","affiliation":["Panepistimio Ioanninon, Ioannina, GR"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Tsiatouhas"},{"name":"Mottaqiallah Taouil","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Mottaqiallah","lastName":"Taouil","id":"37599792100"},{"name":"Said Hamdioui","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"Hamdioui","id":"37085362297"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7603-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1877"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1780"}],"articleNumber":"7138747","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Robustness","Random access memory","Circuit faults","Transistors","Testing","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive open defect detection","charge accumulation effect","test complexity","DRAM cells","DRAM testing procedures","March tests","test algorithm","bit-line imbalance","charge accumulation mechanisms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM testing","resistive opens","test algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138747","abstract":"The test complexity of high density DRAMs increases with technology evolution, due to a larger impact of process variation and weak defects. In particular, resistive open defects turn to be a major concern in DRAMs. Our analysis and simulation results show that an important phenomenon exists, charge accumulation, which is currently not considered in DRAM testing. Charge accumulation occurs in DRAM cells that suffer from internal resistive opens; a weak value stored at a cell is strengthened when a sequence of read operations is applied to it. Typical DRAM testing procedures (like March tests) fail to provide enhanced coverage of resistive open defects, since they do not consider charge accumulation. This paper provides an effective test algorithm that targets resistive open defects, while considering the bit-line imbalance and the charge accumulation mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/ETS.2015.7138747","publicationTitle":"2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7127855/7138715/07138747.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2015.7138747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On resistive open defect detection in DRAMs: The charge accumulation effect","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"On resistive open defect detection in DRAMs: The charge accumulation effect","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138747/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285886","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On resistive open defect detection in DRAMs: The charge accumulation effect","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074122S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7127855","isNumber":"7138715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7127855","xplore-issue":"7138715","articleId":"7138747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7138748,"authors":[{"name":"Elena I.

We analyze the effect of control voltage tuning on the fresh and aged cell failure probabilities and, as a result, we propose a power- and aging-aware circuit level variability mitigation technique based on control voltage tuning. We observed that increasing the values of control voltages, the cell failure probability is reduced at different extends (according to the control voltage under variation), but also that the power consumption is increased. As a result, we have identified the control voltage with the highest impact on the fresh cell reliability, and on the endurance of the cell under study.

This is achieved by exploiting different signal delays on each chip stemming from uncontrollable variations during the manufacturing process. Thus, the relation between RO frequencies on an individual chip can be used as the chip's unique PUF signature. In this work, we show how ROs implemented on a larger number of Altera Cyclone IV FPGAs are biased towards slower or faster frequencies in non-uniform ways depending on the FPGA's programming with different design; even though the ROs are placed and routed equally. Without considering these biases, inter-device uniqueness of the PUF signatures is degraded. We demonstrate that subtracting the mean frequency of each RO - derived using only a small training set of devices - from the sampled frequencies overcomes this disadvantage; i.e. the uniqueness is increased drastically while maintaining reliability.","publicationTitle":"2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7127855/7138715/07138749.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2015.7138749","doi":"10.1109/ETS.2015.7138749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving RO-PUF quality on FPGAs by incorporating design-dependent frequency biases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving RO-PUF quality on FPGAs by incorporating design-dependent frequency biases","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138749/","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7138749/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285873","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving RO-PUF quality on FPGAs by incorporating design-dependent frequency biases","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051224S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7127855","isNumber":"7138715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7127855","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7138715","articleId":"7138749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7138752,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Rossi","affiliation":["ECS, University of Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37085360127"},{"name":"Vasileios Tenentes","affiliation":["ECS, University of Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Tenentes","id":"37393972000"},{"name":"Saqib Khursheed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering & Electronics, University of Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Saqib","lastName":"Khursheed","id":"38286610400"},{"name":"Bashir M.

Generally a high frequency to low frequency conversion, such as a peak or amplitude detector, is employed to analyze the output of the device under test (DUT). However, this conversion circuit is subject to similar process variations as the DUT, which has to be included in the measurement process. Moreover, despite affecting the accuracy of the entire measurement, the input generation for RF BIST is sparsely discussed. While relative measurements, such as gain, can be made without knowing the input signal attributes, other parameters, such as output power, IIP3, or IIP5 require absolute measurements, hence the knowledge of the input signal amplitude. In this paper, we propose a technique for on-chip amplitude measurement that is independent of process variations. The approach relies on on-chip generation of a square wave using an RF limiter with two different amplitudes. Using these two input signals and mathematical modeling, we extract the amplitude at the output of the DUT with high accuracy. The circuits for the BIST have been designed and simulated at the transistor level, including process variations. The concept of the proposed measurement technique is demonstrated in hardware using off-the-shelf components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7138762/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285878","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust amplitude measurement for RF BIST applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust amplitude measurement for RF BIST applications","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056486S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7127855","isNumber":"7138715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7127855","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7138715","articleId":"7138762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7138763,"authors":[{"name":"Charalambos Konstantinou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New York University-Abu Dhabi"],"firstName":"Charalambos","lastName":"Konstantinou","id":"37085400691"},{"name":"Michail Maniatakos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New York University-Abu Dhabi"],"firstName":"Michail","lastName":"Maniatakos","id":"37392264300"},{"name":"Fareena Saqib","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Fareena","lastName":"Saqib","id":"37085355452"},{"name":"Shiyan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, USA"],"firstName":"Shiyan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37290175500"},{"name":"Jim Plusquellic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Plusquellic","id":"37330239000"},{"name":"Yier Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Yier","lastName":"Jin","id":"37402122400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7603-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1877"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1780"}],"articleNumber":"7138763","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Smart homes","Computer crime","Medical services","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyber-physical system","CPS","computational elements","communications","control systems","nation-wide power grids","smart home","ubiquitous health care systems","security measure","trust measure","security violations","privacy leakage","integration elements"]}],"abstract":"A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a composition of independently interacting components, including computational elements, communications and control systems.

Moreover, FPGA and IC implementation examples for a specific noise-shaping filter are given, accompanied by power, area and delay estimations.","doi":"10.1109/FCS.2015.7138880","publicationTitle":"2015 Joint Conference of the IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium & the European Frequency and Time Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Joint Conference of the IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium & the European Frequency and Time Forum","pdfPath":"/iel7/7126857/7138776/07138880.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCS.2015.7138880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138776","startPage":"452","endPage":"455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation aspects of Multi-Step Look-Ahead \u03a3-\u0394 modulation-like architectures for all-digital frequency synthesis applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation aspects of Multi-Step Look-Ahead \u03a3-\u0394 modulation-like architectures for all-digital frequency synthesis applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138880/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15285722","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7138880/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation aspects of Multi-Step Look-Ahead \u03a3-\u0394 modulation-like architectures for all-digital frequency synthesis applications","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"5335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059853S","chronDate":"12-16 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126857","isNumber":"7138776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126857","xplore-issue":"7138776","articleId":"7138880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7138932,"authors":[{"name":"P.-Y.

Recently, scene understanding approaches based on 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation have become popular, but existing methods either do not scale, fail outdoors, provide only sparse reconstructions or are rather slow. In this paper, we build on a recent hash-based technique for large-scale fusion and an efficient mean-field inference algorithm for densely-connected CRFs to present what to our knowledge is the first system that can perform dense, large-scale, outdoor semantic reconstruction of a scene in (near) real time. We also present a `semantic fusion' approach that allows us to handle dynamic objects more effectively than previous approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the KITTI dataset, and provide qualitative and quantitative results showing high-quality dense reconstruction and labelling of a number of scenes.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7138983","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07138983.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7138983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental dense semantic stereo fusion for large-scale semantic scene reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138983/","displayDocTitle":"Incremental dense semantic stereo fusion for large-scale semantic scene reconstruction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285971","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138983/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental dense semantic stereo fusion for large-scale semantic scene reconstruction","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088413S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7138983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7138989,"authors":[{"name":"Tanner Schmidt","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Tanner","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37085595622"},{"name":"Katharina Hertkorn","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Katharina","lastName":"Hertkorn","id":"37546462600"},{"name":"Richard Newcombe","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Newcombe","id":"37546479500"},{"name":"Zoltan Marton","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Zoltan","lastName":"Marton","id":"37583288500"},{"name":"Michael Suppa","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Suppa","id":"37273191400"},{"name":"Dieter Fox","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Fox","id":"37284329000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7138989","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":781},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138989","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Joints","Robot sensing systems","Cameras","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grippers","manipulators","object detection","object tracking","robot vision","stability","state estimation","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth-based tracking","physical constraints","robot manipulation","visual constraints","real-time depth-only tracking","articulated objects","robot manipulator target tracking","manipulation target tracking","DART","visual articulated object tracker","torque sensors","touch sensors","stability","switching model","object detection","shared autonomy system","state estimation","grasp planner","anthropomorphic hands"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7138989","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07138989.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7138989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth-based tracking with physical constraints for robot manipulation","abstract":"This work integrates visual and physical constraints to perform real-time depth-only tracking of articulated objects, with a focus on tracking a robot's manipulators and manipulation targets in realistic scenarios. As such, we extend DART, an existing visual articulated object tracker, to additionally avoid interpenetration of multiple interacting objects, and to make use of contact information collected via torque sensors or touch sensors. To achieve greater stability, the tracker uses a switching model to detect when an object is stationary relative to the table or relative to the palm and then uses information from multiple frames to converge to an accurate and stable estimate. Deviation from stable states is detected in order to remain robust to failed grasps and dropped objects. The tracker is integrated into a shared autonomy system in which it provides state estimates used by a grasp planner and the controller of two anthropomorphic hands. We demonstrate the advantages and performance of the tracking system in simulation and on a real robot.

However, current motion skill learning methods typically restrict the behavior to a compact, low-dimensional representation, limiting its expressiveness and generality. In this paper, we extend a recently developed policy search method [1] and use it to learn a range of dynamic manipulation behaviors with highly general policy representations, without using known models or example demonstrations. Our approach learns a set of trajectories for the desired motion skill by using iteratively refitted time-varying linear models, and then unifies these trajectories into a single control policy that can generalize to new situations. To enable this method to run on a real robot, we introduce several improvements that reduce the sample count and automate parameter selection. We show that our method can acquire fast, fluent behaviors after only minutes of interaction time, and can learn robust controllers for complex tasks, including putting together a toy airplane, stacking tight-fitting lego blocks, placing wooden rings onto tight-fitting pegs, inserting a shoe tree into a shoe, and screwing bottle caps onto bottles.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07138994.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"163","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7138994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7138994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning contact-rich manipulation skills with guided policy search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Robots","Training","Heuristic algorithms","Cost function","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","linear systems","robots","robust control","search problems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contact-rich manipulation skill learning","guided policy search method","autonomous object manipulation skill learning","motion skill learning methods","compact low-dimensional representation","dynamic manipulation behaviors","iterativel refitted time-varying linear models","single control policy","parameter selection automation","sample count reduction","learn robust controllers","toy airplane","tight-fitting lego block stacking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7138994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning contact-rich manipulation skills with guided policy search","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7138994/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286177","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning contact-rich manipulation skills with guided policy search","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057784S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7138994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139016,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhen Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenzhen","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085486405"},{"name":"Rui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and CSAIL, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Li","id":"37070119300"},{"name":"Mandayam A.

For a robot hand to manually explore the environment or perform a manipulation task such as grasping, sensing of shear forces and detecting incipient slip is important. In this paper, we introduce a method of sensing the normal, shear and torsional load on the contact surface with a GelSight tactile sensor [1]. In addition, we demonstrate the detection of incipient slip. The method consists of inferring the state of the contact interface based on analysis of the sequence of images of GelSights elastomer medium, whose deformation under the external load indicates the conditions of contact. Results with a robot gripper like experimental setup show that the method is effective in detecting interactions with an object during stable grasp as well as at incipient slip. The method is also applicable to other optical based tactile sensors.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139016","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139016.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of shear and slip with a GelSight tactile sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139016/","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of shear and slip with a GelSight tactile sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286480","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139016/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of shear and slip with a GelSight tactile sensor","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074428S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7139019,"authors":[{"name":"Krishnendu Chatterjee","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology Austria, Klosterneuburg, Nieder\u00c3\u00b6sterreich, AT"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37271206600"},{"name":"Martin Chmel\u00edk","affiliation":["IST Austria (Institute of Science and Technology Austria), Klosterneuburg, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Chmel\u00edk","id":"37085362434"},{"name":"Raghav Gupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India"],"firstName":"Raghav","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085351173"},{"name":"Ayush Kanodia","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, IN"],"firstName":"Ayush","lastName":"Kanodia","id":"37087828248"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139019","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Rocks","Uncertainty","Algorithm design and analysis","Probabilistic logic","Fuels","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","control engineering computing","formal specification","Markov processes","robots","temporal logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["POMDP","temporal logic specifications","robotics","partially observable Markov decision process","linear-time temporal logic","LTL","qualitative analysis problem","finite-memory policies","EXPTIME-complete","robot motion planning","exponential complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139019","abstract":"We consider partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), that are a standard framework for robotics applications to model uncertainties present in the real world, with temporal logic specifications.

While the qualitative analysis of POMDPs with parity objectives is undecidable, recent results show that when restricted to finite-memory policies the problem is EXPTIME-complete. While the problem is intractable in theory, we present a practical approach to solve the qualitative analysis problem. We designed several heuristics to deal with the exponential complexity, and have used our implementation on a number of well-known POMDP examples for robotics applications.

However, different persons, even those of the same gender or ethnicity, usually have significantly different faces in terms of their overall appearance, which forms the base of person recognition using faces. Consequently, existing 3D reference model based methods have limited capability of reconstructing 3D face models for a large variety of persons. In this paper, we propose to explore a reservoir of diverse reference models to improve the 3D face reconstruction performance. Specifically, we convert the face reconstruction problem into a multi-label segmentation problem. Its energy function is formulated from different cues, including 1) similarity between the desired output and the initial model, 2) color consistency between different views, 3) smoothness constraint on adjacent pixels, and 4) model consistency within local neighborhood. Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of recovering high quality face models in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139051","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139051.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"200","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Example-based 3D face reconstruction from uncalibrated frontal and profile images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Example-based 3D face reconstruction from uncalibrated frontal and profile images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139051/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287018","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139051/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Example-based 3D face reconstruction from uncalibrated frontal and profile images","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"OS43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063072S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139060,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Cao","id":"38506905800"},{"name":"Anil K.

However, estimation of orientation fields in latents is very challenging because latents are usually of poor quality. Inspired by the superiority of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) for various classification and recognition tasks, we pose latent orientation field estimation in a latent patch to a classification problem, and propose a ConvNet based approach for latent orientation field estimation. The underlying idea is to identify the orientation field of a latent patch as one of a set of representative orientation patterns. To achieve this, 128 representative orientation patterns are learnt from a large number of orientation fields. For each orientation pattern, 10,000 fingerprint patches are selected to train the ConvNet. To simulate the quality of latents, texture noise is added to the training patches. Given image patches extracted from a latent, their orientation patterns are predicted by the trained ConvNet and quilted together to estimate the orientation field of the whole latent. Experimental results on NIST SD27 latent database demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art orientation field estimation algorithms and can boost the identification performance of a state-of-the-art latent matcher by score fusion.","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139060","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139060.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"356","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latent orientation field estimation via convolutional neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Latent orientation field estimation via convolutional neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15286992","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139060/","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latent orientation field estimation via convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"OS71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046634S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7139069,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Bringer","affiliation":["Morpho, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Bringer","id":"37596358100"},{"name":"Constance Morel","affiliation":["Morpho, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Constance","lastName":"Morel","id":"37085595138"},{"name":"Christian Rathgeb","affiliation":["da/sec - Biometrics and Internet Security Research Group, Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Rathgeb","id":"37542148100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7824-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-4201"}],"articleNumber":"7139069","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Iris recognition","Security","Hamming distance","Encoding","Training","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data structures","iris recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security analysis","Bloom filter","iris biometric template protection","unlinkability","irreversibility","iriscode"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139069","abstract":"This paper analyses the unlinkability and the irreversibility of the iris biometric template protection system based on Bloom filters introduced at ICB 2013.

Unlike existing methods that assume the independence of attributes during their prediction, we propose a multi-label convolutional neural network (MLCNN) to predict multiple attributes together in a unified framework. Firstly, a pedestrian image is roughly divided into multiple overlapping body parts, which are simultaneously integrated in the multi-label convolutional neural network. Secondly, these parts are filtered independently and aggregated in the cost layer. The cost function is a combination of multiple binary attribute classification cost functions. Moreover, we propose an attribute assisted person re-identification method, which fuses attribute distances and low-level feature distances between pairs of person images to improve person re-identification performance. Extensive experiments show: 1) the average attribute classification accuracy of the proposed method is 5.2% and 9.3% higher than the SVM-based method on three public databases, VIPeR and GRID, respectively; 2) the proposed attribute assisted person re-identification method is superior to existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139070","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139070.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-label CNN based pedestrian attribute learning for soft biometrics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-label CNN based pedestrian attribute learning for soft biometrics","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139070/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287035","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-label CNN based pedestrian attribute learning for soft biometrics","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"OS93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090247S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7139082,"authors":[{"name":"Keyurkumar Patel","affiliation":["Michigan State University"],"firstName":"Keyurkumar","lastName":"Patel","id":"37085426155"},{"name":"Hu Han","affiliation":["Michigan State University"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Han","id":"38527282400"},{"name":"Anil.

We address the problem of facial spoofing detection against replay attacks based on the analysis of aliasing in spoof face videos. The application domain of interest is mobile phone unlock. We analyze the moir\u00e9 pattern aliasing that commonly appears during the recapture of video or photo replays on a screen in different channels (R, G, B and grayscale) and regions (the whole frame, detected face, and facial component between the nose and chin). Multi-scale LBP and DSIFT features are used to represent the characteristics of moir\u00e9 patterns that differentiate a replayed spoof face from a live face (face present). Experimental results on Idiap replay-attack and CASIA databases as well as a database collected in our laboratory (RAFS), which is based on the MSU-FSD database, shows that the proposed approach is very effective in face spoof detection for both cross-database, and intra-database testing scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139082/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15287045","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139082/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Live face video vs. spoof face video: Use of moir\u00e9 patterns to detect replay video attacks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Live face video vs. spoof face video: Use of moir\u00e9 patterns to detect replay video attacks","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PS112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059404S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7139087,"authors":[{"name":"Lacey Best-Rowden","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Lacey","lastName":"Best-Rowden","id":"37085389316"},{"name":"Anil K.

Because aging is a complex process involving genetic and environmental factors, some faces \u201cage well\u201d while the appearance of others changes drastically over time. This heterogeneity (inter-subject variability) suggests the need for a subject-specific aging analysis. In this paper, we conduct such an analysis using a longitudinal database of 147,784 operational mug shots of 18,007 repeat criminal offenders, where each subject has at least five face images acquired over a minimum of five years. By fitting multilevel statistical models to genuine similarity scores from two commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) matchers, we quantify (i) the population average rate of change in genuine scores with respect to the elapsed time between two face images, and (ii) how closely the subject-specific rates of change follow the population average. Longitudinal analysis of the scores from the more accurate COTS matcher shows that despite decreasing genuine scores over time, the average subject can still be correctly verified at a false accept rate (FAR) of 0.01% across all 16 years of elapsed time in our database. We also investigate (i) the effects of several other covariates (gender, race, face quality), and (ii) the probability of true acceptance over time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A longitudinal study of automatic face recognition","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139087","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139087.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A longitudinal study of automatic face recognition","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139087/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A longitudinal study of automatic face recognition","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PS21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116827S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139089,"authors":[{"name":"Jordan Cheney","affiliation":["Noblis, Falls Church, VA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Jordan","lastName":"Cheney","id":"37085357451"},{"name":"Ben Klein","affiliation":["Noblis, Falls Church, VA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Klein","id":"37085343810"},{"name":"Anil K.

Nine different face detection algorithms are studied, which are acquired through either government rights, open source, or commercial licensing. The primary data set utilized for analysis is the IAPRA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A), a recently released unconstrained face detection and recognition dataset which, at the time of this study, contained 67,183 manually localized faces in 5,712 images and 20,408 video frames. The goal of the study is to determine the state of the art in face detection with respect to unconstrained imagery which is motivated by the saturation of recognition accuracies on seminal unconstrained face recognition datasets which are filtered to only contain faces detectable by a commodity face detection algorithm. The most notable finding from this study is that top performing detectors still fail to detect the vast majority of faces with extreme pose, partial occlusion, and/or poor illumination. In total, over 20% of faces fail to be detected by all nine detectors studied. The speed of the detectors was generally correlated with accuracy: faster detectors were less accurate than their slower counterparts. Finally, key considerations and guidance is provided for performing face detection evaluations. All software using these methods to conduct the evaluations and plot the accuracies are made available in the open source.","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139089","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139089.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconstrained face detection: State of the art baseline and challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139089/","displayDocTitle":"Unconstrained face detection: State of the art baseline and challenges","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139089/","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconstrained face detection: State of the art baseline and challenges","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PS23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056777S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139090,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Chun Yang","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Chun","lastName":"Yang","id":"38238464100"},{"name":"Chia-Po Wei","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Po","lastName":"Wei","id":"38467124800"},{"name":"Yi-Ren Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Chinese Culture University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ren","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37085575729"},{"name":"Yu-Chiang Frank Wang","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chiang Frank","lastName":"Wang","id":"38195878100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7824-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-4201"}],"articleNumber":"7139090","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Training","Image recognition","Image resolution","Joints","DH-HEMTs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-world video surveillance applications","face image recognition","very low resolution face recognition","high-resolution images","HR training image","face hallucination","sparse representation","VLR input image","face image datasets","VLR face recognition","super-resolution methods","SR methods","HR face image quality"]}],"abstract":"In real-world video surveillance applications, one often needs to recognize face images from a very long distance. Such recognition tasks are very challenging, since such images are typically with very low resolution (VLR). However, if one simply downsamples high-resolution (HR) training images for recognizing the VLR test inputs, or if one directly upsamples the VLR inputs for matching the HR training data, the resulting recognition performance would not be satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a joint face hallucination and recognition approach based on sparse representation. Given a VLR input image, our method is able to synthesize its person-specific HR version with recognition guarantees. In our experiments, we consider two different face image datasets. Empirical results will support the use of our approach for both VLR face recognition. In addition, compared to state-of-the-art super-resolution (SR) methods, we will also show that our method results in improved quality for the recovered HR face images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition at a long distance: Very low resolution face recognition and hallucination","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139090","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139090.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Recognition at a long distance: Very low resolution face recognition and hallucination","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139090/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287011","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition at a long distance: Very low resolution face recognition and hallucination","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PS24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052273S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139092,"authors":[{"name":"Paritosh Mittal","affiliation":["IIIT, Delhi"],"firstName":"Paritosh","lastName":"Mittal","id":"37085375330"},{"name":"Mayank Vatsa","affiliation":["IIIT, Delhi"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Vatsa","id":"37418882300"},{"name":"Richa Singh","affiliation":["IIIT, Delhi"],"firstName":"Richa","lastName":"Singh","id":"37329725500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7824-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-4201"}],"articleNumber":"7139092","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":699},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite sketch recognition via deep network - a transfer learning approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139092","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Databases","Training","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image matching","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","police data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite sketch recognition","deep network","transfer learning approach","law enforcement agencies","software generated composite sketches","image matching","face photographs","deep learning architecture based facial representation","extended PRIP database"]}],"abstract":"Sketch recognition is one of the integral components used by law enforcement agencies in solving crime. In recent past, software generated composite sketches are being preferred as they are more consistent and faster to construct than hand drawn sketches. Matching these composite sketches to face photographs is a complex task because the composite sketches are drawn based on the witness description and lack minute details which are present in photographs. This paper presents a novel algorithm for matching composite sketches with photographs using transfer learning with deep learning representation. In the proposed algorithm, first the deep learning architecture based facial representation is learned using large face database of photos and then the representation is updated using small problem-specific training database.

However, most existing discriminant analysis methods fail to work for single-sample face recognition (SSFR) because there is only a single training sample per person such that the within-class variation of this person cannot be estimated in such scenario. In this paper, we present a new discriminative transfer learning (DTL) approach for SSFR, where discriminant analysis is performed on a multiple-sample generic training set and then transferred into the single-sample gallery set. Specifically, our DTL learns a feature projection to minimize the intra-class variation and maximize the inter-class variation of samples in the training set, and minimize the difference between the generic training set and the gallery set, simultaneously. Experimental results on three face datasets including the FERET, CAS-PEAL-R1, and LFW datasets are presented to show the efficacy of our method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative transfer learning for single-sample face recognition","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139095","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139095.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative transfer learning for single-sample face recognition","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139095/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287020","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative transfer learning for single-sample face recognition","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PS29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074012S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139096,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Jourabloo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Jourabloo","id":"37075747300"},{"name":"Xi Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085547874"},{"name":"Xiaoming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37076098000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7824-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-4201"}],"articleNumber":"7139096","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Shape","Active appearance model","Face recognition","Linear programming","Optimization","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face de-identification","face image","facial attribute preservation","attribute classification","optimization framework","AAM","k-same methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139096","abstract":"In this paper, we recognize the need of de-identifying a face image while preserving a large set of facial attributes, which has not been explicitly studied before. We verify the underling assumption that different visual features are used for identification and attribute classification. As a result, the proposed approach jointly models face de-identification and attribute preservation in a unified optimization framework. Specifically, a face image is represented by the shape and appearance parameters of AAM. Motivated by k-Same, we select k images that share the most similar attributes with those of a test image. Instead of using the average of k images, adopted by k-Same methods, we formulate an objective function and use gradient descent to learn the optimal weights for fusing k images. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs substantially better than the baseline method with a lower face recognition rate, while preserving more facial attributes.","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139096","startPage":"278","endPage":"285","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139096.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attribute preserved face de-identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Attribute preserved face de-identification","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139096/","accessionNumber":"15287015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139096/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attribute preserved face de-identification","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PS210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060671S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139097,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Jin","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290208900"},{"name":"Jiwen Lu","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiwen","lastName":"Lu","id":"37404390100"},{"name":"Qiuqi Ruan","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiuqi","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37299382900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7824-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-4201"}],"articleNumber":"7139097","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Databases","Optimization","Measurement","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","face recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large margin coupled feature learning","cross-modal face recognition","LMCFL method","person recognition","coupled face representation","image pixel level","face image correlation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a Large Margin Coupled Feature Learning (LMCFL) method for cross-modal face recognition, which recognizes persons from facial images captured from different modalities. Most previous cross-modal face recognition methods utilize hand-crafted feature descriptors for face representation, which require strong prior knowledge to engineer and cannot exploit data-adaptive characteristics in feature extraction. In this work, we propose a new LMCFL method to learn coupled face representation at the image pixel level by jointly utilizing the discriminative information of face images in each modality and the correlation information of face images from different modalities. Thus, LMCFL can maximize the margin between positive face pairs and negative face pairs in each modality, and maximize the correlation of face images from different modalities, where discriminative face features can be automatically learned in a discriminative and data-driven way. Our LMCFL is validated on two different cross-modal face recognition applications, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139097","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131935/7139039/07139097.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICB.2015.7139097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139039","startPage":"286","endPage":"292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large Margin Coupled Feature Learning for cross-modal face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large Margin Coupled Feature Learning for cross-modal face recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139097/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287059","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139097/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Margin Coupled Feature Learning for cross-modal face recognition","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"PS211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080646S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131935","isNumber":"7139039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131935","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7139039","articleId":"7139097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139099,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit K.

In this paper, we address the shortcomings of current face template protection schemes and show the advantages of a localized approach. We propose a framework that utilizes features from local regions of the face to achieve exact matching, and thus, enables the security offered by hash functions like SHA-256. We study the matching accuracy of different feature extractors, and propose measures to quantify the security offered by the scheme under reasonable real-world assumptions.

These principal curvatures are derived from the construction of asymptotic cones associated to any Borel subset of the discrete surface. They describe the local geometry of the underlying mesh. First two of them correspond to the classical principal curvatures in the smooth case. We isolate the third principal curvature that carries out meaningful geometric shape information. The three principal curvatures in different Borel subsets scales give multi-scale local facial surface descriptors.

In this paper, a software-defined, near-field wireless power transfer (WPT) platform is proposed where a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is used to optimize the power transfer effieciency of the system. A prototype platform operating at 13.56 MHz is designed and fabricated and the capability of the PSO to tune the system to the operating point of maximum efficiency is demonstrated by experiments. It is shown that by controlling the matching network of the transmit and receive chain through the PSO algorithm it is possible to reach the optimum solution within a few iterations. The proposed system can find application in adaptively tuned WPT systems.","doi":"10.1109/WPT.2015.7139137","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Wireless Power Transfer Conference (WPTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131285/7139127/07139137.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Wireless Power Transfer Conference (WPTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPT.2015.7139137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A particle swarm optimizer for tuning a software-defined, highly configurable wireless power transfer platform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Receivers","Particle swarm optimization","Tuning","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductive power transmission","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimizer","resonant coupling","frequency splitting phenomenon","resonance frequency detuning","software-defined near-field wireless power transfer","WPT platform","PSO","matching network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["software defined","reconfigurable matching network","wireless power transfer","resonant magnetic coupling","particle swarm optimization","adaptive tuning","rectifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A particle swarm optimizer for tuning a software-defined, highly configurable wireless power transfer platform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139137/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286900","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle swarm optimizer for tuning a software-defined, highly configurable wireless power transfer platform","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"F24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053561S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131285","isNumber":"7139127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131285","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7139127","articleId":"7139137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139138,"authors":[{"name":"Nazmul Hasan","affiliation":["Utah State University, USA"],"firstName":"Nazmul","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37089141067"},{"name":"Tuba Yilmaz","affiliation":["Mitos Medical Technologies, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tuba","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"38057709600"},{"name":"Regan Zane","affiliation":["Utah State University, USA"],"firstName":"Regan","lastName":"Zane","id":"37276054500"},{"name":"Zeljko Pantic","affiliation":["Utah State University, USA"],"firstName":"Zeljko","lastName":"Pantic","id":"37597560400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7447-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7139138","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":695},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139138","abstract":"This paper proposes a stochastic method - particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Pareto front technique, to conduct a multivariable optimization and design an inductively coupled power transfer system.

The algorithm proposed in this paper models all losses and inductance matrix analytically.

Key system concepts for resonant wireless power transfer, such as frequency splitting, maximum operating distance, and behavior of the system as it becomes over and under coupled, are well understood theoretically, and demonstrated experimentally. Although prior work on WPT in air is quite extensive and mature, very little research has been conducted on underwater WPT. In particular, no studies have been published describing how basic system concepts vary within a conducting medium such as seawater. In this paper, we report the results of experiments addressing the effects of seawater conductivity on underwater resonant wireless power transfer, compared to the basic system concepts exhibited in air. Results indicate that the losses due to seawater become noticeable for frequencies around 20 kHz, and can be large for frequencies above 50 kHz.","doi":"10.1109/WPT.2015.7139141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPT.2015.7139141","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Wireless Power Transfer Conference (WPTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Wireless Power Transfer Conference (WPTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131285/7139127/07139141.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater wireless power transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139141/","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Underwater wireless power transfer","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15286895","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139141/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater wireless power transfer","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"F34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043984S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131285","isNumber":"7139127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131285","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7139127","articleId":"7139141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7139170,"authors":[{"name":"Elmira Hajimani","affiliation":["FCT, University of Algarve"],"firstName":"Elmira","lastName":"Hajimani","id":"37860410300"},{"name":"M.

A Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) based approach is used to determine the architecture of the classifier, its corresponding parameters and input features subject to multiple objectives and their corresponding restrictions and priorities. This classifier is part of a computerized automatic diagnosis system for identification of Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA) through analysis of Computer Tomographic images (CT).

Its analysis is straightforward for various power amplifier classes. However, when using class-E power amplifiers, the outphasing analysis requires several steps in order to achieve performance prediction. In this paper, a simplified analysis and design of class-E outphasing transmitters is proposed as an alternative method that predicts efficiency and output power as a function of input drive phase difference based on classic design equations of the class-E amplifier. It is shown that the efficiency at backoff power can be optimized by the asymmetric combiner electrical lengths and the design parameters are then simplified so that they can be used in an actual prototype.","doi":"10.1109/PAWR.2015.7139197","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7118513/7139189/07139197.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAWR.2015.7139197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139189","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified analysis and design of outphasing transmitters using class-E power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simplified analysis and design of outphasing transmitters using class-E power amplifiers","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139197/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15274872","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139197/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified analysis and design of outphasing transmitters using class-E power amplifiers","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PA150359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039287S","chronDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7118513","isNumber":"7139189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7118513","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7139189","articleId":"7139197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139198,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Mimis","affiliation":["Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Mimis","id":"37855575900"},{"name":"Gavin T.

In most cases demonstrated in the open literature, the spectral spreading of the device is indirectly assessed by a metric such as the adjacent-channel power ratio or third-order intermodulation product. In the present paper, a spectral mask compliance metric is introduced that is less than or equal to zero for compliant spectra and positive for noncompliant spectra. The paper first examines the load-pull measurement for the spectral mask compliance metric, including the use of averaging to smooth the contours. Direct, dual-objective design of power amplifiers for spectral mask compliance and efficiency is then demonstrated by choosing the load impedance that provides the highest measured power-added efficiency while maintaining spectral compliance. With the device terminated in the chosen optimum impedance, measurement of the output spectrum and comparison with a spectral mask are performed to demonstrate spectral compliance at the selected design impedance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139199/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15274869","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Designing power amplifiers for spectral compliance using spectral mask load-pull measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing power amplifiers for spectral compliance using spectral mask load-pull measurements","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PA150267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058924S","chronDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7118513","isNumber":"7139189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7118513","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7139189","articleId":"7139199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":7139200,"authors":[{"name":"Qinyang Wu","affiliation":["RML Technology Co., Ltd., Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Qinyang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085438938"},{"name":"Bai Song","affiliation":["RML Technology Co., Ltd., Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Bai","lastName":"Song","id":"37085429309"},{"name":"Yi-chi Shih","affiliation":["RML Technology Co., Ltd., Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yi-chi","lastName":"Shih","id":"37085447359"},{"name":"Xiaoqi Huang","affiliation":["RML Technology Co., Ltd., Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085431311"},{"name":"Jingwei Wu","affiliation":["RML Technology Co., Ltd., Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Jingwei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085446921"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5515-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7139200","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":797},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139200","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Impedance","Gain","PHEMTs","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit tuning","field effect MMIC","gallium arsenide","HEMT integrated circuits","III-V semiconductors","MMIC power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full X-band high-efficiency MMIC power amplifier","GaAs pHEMT process","power-added efficiency","3-stage amplifier","harmonic tuning","power 12 W","frequency 8 GHz to 12 GHz","size 0.25 mum","efficiency 37 percent to 54 percent","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)","high power amplifier","gallium arsenide","high efficiency","X-band"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the design and measurements of a 8-12GHz high-efficiency MMIC high power amplifier (HPA) implemented in a 0.25\u03bcm GaAS pHEMT process is described.

The key to this design is determining and matching the optimum source and load impedance for PAE at the first two harmonics in output stage.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAWR.2015.7139200","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7118513/7139189/07139200.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doi":"10.1109/PAWR.2015.7139200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A full X-band high-efficiency 12-watt GaAs MMIC power amplifier with harmonic tuning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A full X-band high-efficiency 12-watt GaAs MMIC power amplifier with harmonic tuning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139200/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"15274854","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139200/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A full X-band high-efficiency 12-watt GaAs MMIC power amplifier with harmonic tuning","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PA150184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036095S","chronDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7118513","isNumber":"7139189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7118513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7139189","articleId":"7139200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139202,"authors":[{"name":"Hideyuki Nakamizo","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA, USA","Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Nakamizo","id":"38221510200"},{"name":"Kenji Mukai","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Mukai","id":"37072458500"},{"name":"Shintaro Shinjo","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Shintaro","lastName":"Shinjo","id":"37298358300"},{"name":"Hamed Gheidi","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Gheidi","id":"37660221000"},{"name":"Peter Asbeck","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Asbeck","id":"37274669300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5515-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7139202","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":822},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Power amplifiers","Field effect transistors","Switches","MMICs","Power measurement","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrap circuits","CMOS digital integrated circuits","driver circuits","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","UHF integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAE voltage-mode class D power amplifier","digitally-driven switching-mode amplifier","LTE band 31","integrated circuit","stacked GaN FETs","bootstrap-drive configuration","VMCD amplifier","driver-stage efficiency","power-added efficiency","commercial wireless frequency","digital CMOS circuits","frequency 465 MHz","power 3.3 W","efficiency 36.3 percent","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GaN","power amplifiers","PAE","VMCD","switching-mode amplifiers","bootstrap"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139202","doi":"10.1109/PAWR.2015.7139202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAWR.2015.7139202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139189","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7118513/7139189/07139202.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Over 65% PAE GaN voltage-mode class d power amplifier for 465 MHz operation using bootstrap drive","abstract":"We report a digitally-driven switching-mode amplifier using GaN devices in Voltage-Mode Class D operation, for use at 465 MHz (the recently designated frequency for LTE Band 31).

The PLM technique leverages on the load modulation characteristics incurred for modulated pulses with different duty cycles as the consequence of the interactions between switching PAs with the high-Q output filter. Though a high drain efficiency is promised by the PLM amplifier with a binary envelop input, the low coding efficiency of the 2-level pulse modulations including the 2-level Envelope Delta- Sigma Modulation (EDSM) reduces the effective gain of the PA and thus decreases the overall power added efficiency. The great amount of quantization noise also needs to be rejected with high-Q filter which adds a great burden to the output filter design. In this paper, it is proposed to feed the PLM PA with a 3-level EDSM signal for input with higher effective gain and lower quantization noise. The concept is demonstrated with an X-band PLM PA fabricated with discrete 0.25\u03bcm GaN HEMT.

In addition, cost reducing tactics for large volume applications naturally lead to CMOS based PAs which are less linear than the commonly used GaAs PAs. Envelope tracking techniques, together with digital signal processing (DSP), provide a method for achieving the linearity and efficiency required for CMOS PAs. This paper reviews the new technical challenges associated with envelope tracking methods for high data rate PAs utilized in carrier agg regation systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Power amplifiers","CMOS technology","Long Term Evolution","Linearity","Bandwidth","Gallium arsenide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","linearisation techniques","Long Term Evolution","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS high bandwidth envelope tracking","power amplifiers","LTE carrier aggregation","CA","linearity requirements","digital signal processing","DSP","technical challenges","high data rate PA","long-term evolution","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","LTE","power amplifier","envelope tracking","carrier aggregation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PAWR.2015.7139211","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Topical Conference on Power Amplifiers for Wireless and Radio Applications (PAWR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7118513/7139189/07139211.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAWR.2015.7139211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS high bandwidth envelope tracking and power amplifiers for LTE carrier aggregation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CMOS high bandwidth envelope tracking and power amplifiers for LTE carrier aggregation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139211/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139211/","accessionNumber":"15274868","conferenceDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS high bandwidth envelope tracking and power amplifiers for LTE carrier aggregation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PA150357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036206S","chronDate":"25-28 Jan. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7118513","isNumber":"7139189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7118513","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7139189","articleId":"7139211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139213,"authors":[{"name":"Norbert Leder","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Austria"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Leder","id":"37085379424"},{"name":"Thomas Faseth","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Faseth","id":"37546822700"},{"name":"Henri Ruotsalainen","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Austria"],"firstName":"Henri","lastName":"Ruotsalainen","id":"37659086800"},{"name":"Holger Arthaber","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Microwave and Circuit Engineering, Austria"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Arthaber","id":"37296223000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5515-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7139213","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139213","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Integrated circuit modeling","Distortion measurement","Microwave measurement","Nonlinear distortion","Complexity theory","Pulse measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver circuits","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switch mode power amplifier measurements","class-S amplifiers","nonlinear effects","signal components","configurable pulse driver","Triquint TGA4954-SL","digital pulse generating system","relatively short sequence","generic excitation sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","microwave amplifiers","nonlinear distortion","nonlinear modeling","power amplifiers","pulse amplifiers"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses linearity issues of pulse drivers for the use in class-S power amplifiers.

Methods based on deep learning have shown significant improvements in accuracy, which makes them particularly suitable for applications, such as pedestrian detection, where reducing the miss rate is very important. Although they are accurate, their runtime has been at best in seconds per image, which makes them not practical for onboard applications. We present a Large-Field-Of-View (LFOV) deep network for pedestrian detection, that can achieve high accuracy and is designed to make deep networks work faster for detection problems. The idea of the proposed Large-Field-of-View deep network is to learn to make classification decisions simultaneously and accurately at multiple locations. The LFOV network processes larger image areas at much faster speeds than typical deep networks have been able to, and can intrinsically reuse computations.

Partly this is caused by physical constraints, e.g. small available actuation forces. Another reason is the dynamic coupling between the actuators that cannot be neglected during fast motions. Therefore, a model-based MIMO controller in actuator space was developed, that is based on a spatial dynamic model with one mass point per section. Using feedback linearization, the actuators can be decoupled and feedforward control in combination with linear controllers can be applied. Measurements of an example manipulator show the good tracking result of pure feedforward action with feedback linearization. Adding a linear PD-controller increases the robustness against disturbances without reducing the possibility of fast motions.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139264","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139264.pdf","startPage":"762","endPage":"767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based feedforward position control of constant curvature continuum robots using feedback linearization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Model-based feedforward position control of constant curvature continuum robots using feedback linearization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286487","htmlLink":"/document/7139264/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based feedforward position control of constant curvature continuum robots using feedback linearization","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068715S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7139270,"authors":[{"name":"Chien Chern Cheah","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Republic of Singapore"],"firstName":"Chien Chern","lastName":"Cheah","id":"37085364302"},{"name":"Quang Minh Ta","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Republic of Singapore"],"lastName":"Quang Minh Ta","id":"37085554068"},{"name":"Reza Haghighi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Republic of Singapore"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Haghighi","id":"37546325800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139270","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beams","Charge carrier processes","Optical sensors","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical refraction","Optical variables control","Manipulator dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology","manipulators","mathematical analysis","radiation pressure","refractive index"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic manipulation","biological cell","multiple optical traps","optical tweezers","single focused laser beam","refractive index","automatic control techniques","robotic control technique","microparticle","mathematical formulations","automated cell manipulation"]}],"abstract":"Existing control techniques for optical tweezers utilize a single focused laser beam to directly trap and manipulate a target cell. However, a typical force generated by an optical trap is extremely small (few pico-newtons) and therefore it is not sufficient to manipulate a larger cell or object. The optical trap is also sensitive to the shape of the biological cell and the refractive index. Therefore, current automatic control techniques for optical tweezers cannot be used to manipulate a large cell or cell with irregular shape. In addition, excessive irradiation of the laser beam to the cell may also cause photodamage of even lead to death of the cell. In this paper, we propose a robotic control technique for optical tweezers to achieve automated manipulation of cell, which is beyond the capability of a single optical trap. First, multiple laser beams are generated, and each laser beam is used to trap one micro-particle to create a formation around the target cell to hold it. Then the target cell is manipulated to a desired position by controlling the motorized stage. The proposed control technique is particularly suitable for automated manipulation of sensitive biological cells, cells with large size or cells of irregular shape. Rigorous mathematical formulations have been developed to analyze the control system for automated cell manipulation. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139270","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139270.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139270","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","startPage":"803","endPage":"808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robotic manipulation of a biological cell using multiple optical traps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robotic manipulation of a biological cell using multiple optical traps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139270/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139270/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286416","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robotic manipulation of a biological cell using multiple optical traps","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073807S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7139277,"authors":[{"name":"Navvab Kashiri","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Technologia, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Navvab","lastName":"Kashiri","id":"38667578800"},{"name":"Gustavo A.

Until recently the regulation of the intrinsic impedance in VIAs is achieved in an open-loop model-based manner, mainly due to the lack of physical sensors capable of measuring impedance components such as stiffness and damping. Hence, the estimation of variable stiffness and damping has been explored, with the target to provide monitoring and feedback for potential closed loop control schemes. However, the use of the output of these estimators in the feedback control of variable impedance actuators has never been implemented/demonstrated in practice. This work contributes to the field with the development and experimental evaluation of a novel damping feedback control for a class of variable impedance compliant actuators able to realize a variable physical damping principle. The scheme is based on non-model-based damping estimation feedback to compensate model uncertainties in the action of an inner controller that uses a model-based friction estimator. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme to replicate with good fidelity constant and time-varying damping levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139277/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286286","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Damping control of variable damping compliant actuators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping control of variable damping compliant actuators","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085537S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139281,"authors":[{"name":"Ashesh Jain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Ashesh","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085435527"},{"name":"Debarghya Das","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Debarghya","lastName":"Das","id":"37089115947"},{"name":"Jayesh K.

While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their partner's motion can be captured well through iterative replanning with the above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function which \u201cexplains\u201d the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example trajectories from two participants performing a collaborative assembly task using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict a human's motion for a given task by iteratively replanning a trajectory for a 23 DoF human kinematic model using the STOMP algorithm with the learned cost function in the presence of a moving collaborator. Our results suggest that our method outperforms baseline methods and generalizes well for tasks similar to those that were demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139282","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","startPage":"885","endPage":"892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting human reaching motion in collaborative tasks using Inverse Optimal Control and iterative re-planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predicting human reaching motion in collaborative tasks using Inverse Optimal Control and iterative re-planning","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139282/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286205","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting human reaching motion in collaborative tasks using Inverse Optimal Control and iterative re-planning","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08512S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139284,"authors":[{"name":"David Coleman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Coleman","id":"38548557200"},{"name":"Ioan A. \u015eucan","affiliation":["Google [x], Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ioan A.","lastName":"\u015eucan","id":"37085532332"},{"name":"Mark Moll","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rice University Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Moll","id":"37272051000"},{"name":"Kei Okada","affiliation":["JSK Lab, Univeristy of Tokyo Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Okada","id":"37280639000"},{"name":"Nikolaus Correll","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Nikolaus","lastName":"Correll","id":"37564236500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139284","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"abstract":"We present an experience-based planning framework called Thunder that learns to reduce computation time required to solve high-dimensional planning problems in varying environments. The approach is especially suited for large configuration spaces that include many invariant constraints, such as those found with whole body humanoid motion planning. Experiences are generated using probabilistic sampling and stored in a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS), which provides asymptotically near-optimal coverage of the configuration space, making storing, retrieving, and repairing past experiences very efficient with respect to memory and time. The Thunder framework improves upon past experience-based planners by storing experiences in a graph rather than in individual paths, eliminating redundant information, providing more opportunities for path reuse, and providing a theoretical limit to the size of the experience graph. These properties also lead to improved handling of dynamically changing environments, reasoning about optimal paths, and reducing query resolution time. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom humanoid robot and compared with the Lightning framework, an experience-based planner that uses individual paths to store past experiences. In environments with variable obstacles and stability constraints, experiments show that Thunder is on average an order of magnitude faster than Lightning and planning from scratch. Thunder also uses 98.8% less memory to store its experiences after 10,000 trials when compared to Lightning. Our framework is implemented and freely available in the Open Motion Planning Library.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139284.pdf","startPage":"900","endPage":"905","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experience-based planning with sparse roadmap spanners","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Lightning","Databases","Collision avoidance","Robot kinematics","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","humanoid robots","mobile robots","path planning","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["experience-based planning","Thunder","high-dimensional planning problem","whole body humanoid motion planning","sparse roadmap spanner","SPARS","query resolution time","30 degree-of-freedom humanoid robot","lightning framework","stability constraint","open motion planning library","probabilistic sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Experience-based planning with sparse roadmap spanners","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139284/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278338","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experience-based planning with sparse roadmap spanners","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062175S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139287,"authors":[{"name":"Arjun Menon","affiliation":["Anki Robotics, SRI International, San Francisco, CA"],"firstName":"Arjun","lastName":"Menon","id":"37085395492"},{"name":"Pooja Kacker","affiliation":["Independent Consultant, Menlo Park, CA"],"firstName":"Pooja","lastName":"Kacker","id":"37085406829"},{"name":"Sachin Chitta","affiliation":["SRI International, Menlo Park, CA"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Chitta","id":"37279717300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139287","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139287","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Observers","Planning","Wrist","Service robots","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","pattern classification","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven approach","human preferences","motion planning","co-robots","robot trajectory designing","human observers","multiple robot trajectories","survey ratings","classifier"]}],"abstract":"Co-robots, i.e. robots that work close to people, will need to account for the preferences and expectations of their human co-workers in executing trajectories or actions. Consistent, legible and predictable trajectories are a key factor in making humans comfortable around robots. In this work, we take a data-driven approach towards designing robot trajectories that are more acceptable to human co-workers and observers. We use an online survey to ask people to rate multiple robot trajectories generated in a variety of environments. We compute a large set of features for each trajectory, also taking into account environment information. We use a combination of the features and the survey ratings to learn a classifier that predicts the rating for a new trajectory based on the learned human-observer preferences. The classifier also helps identify and highlight the most important features that influence people's ratings of the trajectories. Finally, we discuss how a data-driven approach using the results of this analysis can be used to help design better trajectories that are more acceptable to people.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139287","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139287.pdf","startPage":"920","endPage":"927","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a data-driven approach to human preferences in motion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards a data-driven approach to human preferences in motion planning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139287/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285898","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139287/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a data-driven approach to human preferences in motion planning","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067403S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139344,"authors":[{"name":"Adithyavairavan Murali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)","Center for Automation and Learning for Medical Robotics (Cal-MR), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Adithyavairavan","lastName":"Murali","id":"37085349840"},{"name":"Siddarth Sen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)","Center for Automation and Learning for Medical Robotics (Cal-MR), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Siddarth","lastName":"Sen","id":"37085349523"},{"name":"Ben Kehoe","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Kehoe","id":"38252246400"},{"name":"Animesh Garg","affiliation":["Ohio University Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Athens, OH, US"],"firstName":"Animesh","lastName":"Garg","id":"37086330576"},{"name":"Seth McFarland","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering"],"firstName":"Seth","lastName":"McFarland","id":"37088706574"},{"name":"Sachin Patil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)","Center for Automation and Learning for Medical Robotics (Cal-MR), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Patil","id":"37402426300"},{"name":"W.

Programming is difficult because human tissue is deformable and highly specular. Using the da Vinci Research Kit (DVRK) robotic surgical assistant, we explore a \u201cLearning By Observation\u201d (LBO) approach where we identify, segment, and parameterize motion sequences and sensor conditions to build a finite state machine (FSM) for each subtask. The robot then executes the FSM repeatedly to tune parameters and if necessary update the FSM structure. We evaluate the approach on two surgical subtasks: debridement of 3D Viscoelastic Tissue Phantoms (3d-DVTP), in which small target fragments are removed from a 3D viscoelastic tissue phantom; and Pattern Cutting of 2D Orthotropic Tissue Phantoms (2d-PCOTP), a step in the standard Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training suite, in which a specified circular area must be cut from a sheet of orthotropic tissue phantom. We describe the approach and physical experiments with repeatability of 96% for 50 trials of the 3d-DVTP subtask and 70% for 20 trials of the 2d-PCOTP subtask.

A way to accomplish this would be to have multiple sensors deployed in disaster prone areas to detect anomalies. However, compared to static sensor networks, robotic sensor networks offer advantages such as active sensing, large area coverage and anomaly tracking. This paper addresses the problem of coordinating and controlling multiple robots for the detection of multiple dynamic anomalies in the environment. The main contribution of the work is a combined approach for the effective exploration under uncertainty, the anomaly tracking, and the autonomous on-line allocation of agents. Robots explore the work area maintaining the history of the sensed areas to reduce redundancy and to allow for full-map coverage. When an anomaly is detected, a robot autonomously determines how to either track the anomaly or to continue the exploration of the environment, depending on the size of the anomaly, which is estimated by the length of the perimeter of the enclosing polygon. We show results of our methodology both in simulation and with actual robots which have demonstrated that robots can autonomously and distributively be allocated to track or to explore depending on the behavior of the detected anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139353","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139353.pdf","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed multi-robot approach for the detection and tracking of multiple dynamic anomalies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139353/","displayDocTitle":"A distributed multi-robot approach for the detection and tracking of multiple dynamic anomalies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286063","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139353/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed multi-robot approach for the detection and tracking of multiple dynamic anomalies","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080878S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139357,"authors":[{"name":"Bilal Kartal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Bilal","lastName":"Kartal","id":"37085584209"},{"name":"Julio Godoy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Godoy","id":"37085506999"},{"name":"Ioannis Karamouzas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Karamouzas","id":"38111249000"},{"name":"Stephen J.

Creating and annotating datasets for learning is expensive, however. We address this problem with transfer learning from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are pre-trained for image categorization and provide a rich, semantically meaningful feature set. We incorporate depth information, which the CNN was not trained with, by rendering objects from a canonical perspective and colorizing the depth channel according to distance from the object center. We evaluate our approach on the Washington RGB-D Objects dataset, where we find that the generated feature set naturally separates classes and instances well and retains pose manifolds. We outperform state-of-the-art on a number of subtasks and show that our approach can yield superior results when only little training data is available.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139363","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139363.pdf","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"RGB-D object recognition and pose estimation based on pre-trained convolutional neural network features","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286176","htmlLink":"/document/7139363/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RGB-D object recognition and pose estimation based on pre-trained convolutional neural network features","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054103S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139380,"authors":[{"name":"P.

To validate the proposed approach we performed experiments using Kuka Light Weight Robot and HapticMaster robot.

As this system relies on a passive sensor to localize, it is highly susceptible to changes in lighting conditions. Recent work in the optics community has provided a method to transform images collected from a three-channel passive sensor into color-constant images that are resistant to changes in outdoor lighting conditions. This paper presents a lighting-resistant VT&R system that uses experimentally trained color-constant images to autonomously navigate difficult outdoor terrain despite changes in lighting. We show through an extensive field trial that our algorithm is capable of autonomously following a 1km outdoor route spanning sandy/rocky terrain, grassland, and wooded areas. Using a single visual map created at midday, the route was autonomously repeated 26 times over a period of four days, from sunrise to sunset with an autonomy rate (by distance) of over 99.9%. These experiments show that a simple image transformation can extend the operation of VT&R from a few hours to multiple days.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139391","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139391.pdf","startPage":"1519","endPage":"1526","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"It's not easy seeing green: Lighting-resistant stereo Visual Teach & Repeat using color-constant images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"It's not easy seeing green: Lighting-resistant stereo Visual Teach & Repeat using color-constant images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278423","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139391/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"It's not easy seeing green: Lighting-resistant stereo Visual Teach & Repeat using color-constant images","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060057S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139412,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander G.

This poses a challenging decision-making problem, e.g., deciding when to perform a passing maneuver or how to safely merge into traffic. Previous work in the literature has typically approached the problem using ad-hoc solutions that do not consider the possible future states of other agents, and thus have difficulty scaling to complex traffic scenarios where the actions of participating agents are tightly conditioned on one another. In this paper we present multipolicy decision-making (MPDM), a decision-making algorithm that exploits knowledge from the autonomous driving domain to make decisions online for an autonomous vehicle navigating in traffic. By assuming the controlled vehicle and other traffic participants execute a policy from a set of plausible closed-loop policies at every timestep, the algorithm selects the best available policy for the controlled vehicle to execute. We perform policy election using forward simulation of both the controlled vehicle and other agents, efficiently sampling from the high-likelihood outcomes of their interactions. We then score the resulting outcomes using a user-defined cost function to accommodate different driving preferences, and select the policy with the highest score. We demonstrate the algorithm on a real-world autonomous vehicle performing passing maneuvers and in a simulated merging scenario.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139412.pdf","startPage":"1670","endPage":"1677","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPDM: Multipolicy decision-making in dynamic, uncertain environments for autonomous driving","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Decision making","Vehicle dynamics","Approximation methods","Uncertainty","Mobile robots","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","road traffic control","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPDM algorithm","multipolicy decision-making algorithm","dynamic uncertain environments","real-world autonomous driving domain","autonomous vehicle navigation","closed-loop policy","policy election","user-defined cost function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"MPDM: Multipolicy decision-making in dynamic, uncertain environments for autonomous driving","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139412/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286041","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPDM: Multipolicy decision-making in dynamic, uncertain environments for autonomous driving","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060513S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7139417,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In addition, any vision-based state estimator can fail due to the lack of visual information in the scene or due to the loss of feature tracking after an aggressive maneuver. When this happens, the robot should automatically re-initialize the state estimate to maintain its autonomy and, thus, guarantee the safety for itself and the environment. In this paper, we present a system that enables a monocular-vision-based quadrotor to automatically recover from any unknown, initial attitude with significant velocity, such as after loss of visual tracking due to an aggressive maneuver. The recovery procedure consists of multiple stages, in which the quadrotor, first, stabilizes its attitude and altitude, then, re-initializes its visual state-estimation pipeline before stabilizing fully autonomously. To experimentally demonstrate the performance of our system, we aggressively throw the quadrotor in the air by hand and have it recover and stabilize all by itself. We chose this example as it simulates conditions similar to failure recovery during aggressive flight. Our system was able to recover successfully in several hundred throws in both indoor and outdoor environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attitude control","Quaternions","Acceleration","Visualization","Pipelines","Current measurement","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","fault tolerant control","helicopters","mobile robots","robot vision","stability","state estimation","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrotor automatic re-initialization","quadrotor failure recovery","monocular-vision-based quadrotor","attitude stabilization","altitude stabilization","visual state-estimation pipeline"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139420","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1729","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139420.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic re-initialization and failure recovery for aggressive flight with a monocular vision-based quadrotor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic re-initialization and failure recovery for aggressive flight with a monocular vision-based quadrotor","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15286312","publicationDate":"May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139420/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic re-initialization and failure recovery for aggressive flight with a monocular vision-based quadrotor","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064186S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139438,"authors":[{"name":"Alyssa Pierson","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Alyssa","lastName":"Pierson","id":"37085345711"},{"name":"Mac Schwager","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Division of Systems Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Mac","lastName":"Schwager","id":"37424620600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139438","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":446},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dogs","Vehicle dynamics","Robot kinematics","Vehicles","Kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","multi-robot systems","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired non-cooperative multi-robot herding","dog-like robots","noncooperative sheep-like agents","unicycle robot model","Matlab","Pololu m3pi robots"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new control strategy to control a group of dog-like robots to drive a herd of non-cooperative sheep-like agents to a goal region in the environment. The sheep-like agents, which may be biological or robotic, respond to the presence of the dog-like robots with a repelling potential field common in biological models of the behavior of herding animals. Our key insight in designing control laws for the dog-like robots is to enforce geometrical relationships that allow for the combined dynamics of the dogs and sheep to be mapped to a simple unicycle robot model. We prove convergence of a single sheep to a desired goal region using two or more dogs, and we propose a control strategy for the case of any number of sheep driven by two or more dogs.

Unfortunately, traditional robotic actuators have been unable to attain similar properties, especially in a slender muscle-like form factor. Recently, super-coiled polymer (SCP) actuators have rejuvenated the promise of an artificial muscle. Constructed from commercial nylon fishing line or sewing thread and twisted until coils form, these lightweight actuators have been shown to produce significant mechanical power when thermally cycled. In this paper, we develop a thermomechanical and thermoelectric model of SCP actuators, and examine their controllability. With off-the-shelf conductive sewing thread, we show the ability to produce controlled forces in under 30 ms, exceeding human muscle performance. Finally, we use SCP actuators in a robotic hand to demonstrate their applicability as a low-cost, high performance robotic muscle.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Temperature measurement","Force","Yarn","Coils","Muscles","Strain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","controllability","damping","electroactive polymer actuators","force control","manipulator dynamics","pneumatic actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance robotic muscles","off-the-shelf conductive nylon sewing thread","power-to-weight ratios","compliance","damping","high dynamic ranges","fast actuation","super-coiled polymer actuators","artificial muscle","commercial nylon fishing line","mechanical power","thermomechanical model","thermoelectric model","SCP actuators","robotic hand"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139506","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139506","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139506","startPage":"2313","endPage":"2318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance robotic muscles from conductive nylon sewing thread","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-performance robotic muscles from conductive nylon sewing thread","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139506/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139506/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286227","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance robotic muscles from conductive nylon sewing thread","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046319S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7139508,"authors":[{"name":"Atsushi Oosedo","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Systems and Design, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Oosedo","id":"37546456000"},{"name":"Satoko Abiko","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Systems and Design, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoko","lastName":"Abiko","id":"37542764300"},{"name":"Shota Narasaki","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Systems and Design, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shota","lastName":"Narasaki","id":"37085480105"},{"name":"Atsushi Kuno","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Systems and Design, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Kuno","id":"37085496950"},{"name":"Atsushi Konno","affiliation":["Division of System Science and Informatics, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Konno","id":"37323849300"},{"name":"Masaru Uchiyama","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Systems and Design, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaru","lastName":"Uchiyama","id":"37281517000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139508","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1267},"abstract":"Quad tilt rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) solves the problem of underacuated system in general quadrotor UAV.

However, due to the wide range of applications, an algorithm to safely plan in the presence of moving obstacles is required. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that provides computationally efficient planning solutions in environments with static obstacles and several dynamic obstacles with stochastic motions. Path-Guided APF-SR works by first applying a sampling-based technique to identify a valid, collision-free path in the presence of static obstacles. Then, an artificial potential field planning method is used to safely navigate through the moving obstacles using the path as an attractive intermediate goal bias. In order to improve the safety of the artificial potential field, repulsive potential fields around moving obstacles are calculated with stochastic reachable sets, a method previously shown to significantly improve planning success in highly dynamic environments. We show that Path-Guided APF-SR outperforms other methods that have high planning success in environments with 300 stochastically moving obstacles. Furthermore, planning is achievable in environments in which previously developed methods have failed.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139511","startPage":"2347","endPage":"2354","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139511.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path-guided artificial potential fields with stochastic reachable sets for motion planning in highly dynamic environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision avoidance","Planning","Robot kinematics","Vehicle dynamics","Navigation","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","mobile robots","path planning","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path-guided artificial potential fields","stochastic reachable sets","motion planning","highly dynamic environments","static obstacles","dynamic obstacles","stochastic motions","sampling-based technique","collision-free path","artificial potential field planning method","moving obstacle navigation","artificial potential field","repulsive potential fields"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Path-guided artificial potential fields with stochastic reachable sets for motion planning in highly dynamic environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139511/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286330","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path-guided artificial potential fields with stochastic reachable sets for motion planning in highly dynamic environments","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066647S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-21"},{"_id":7139513,"authors":[{"name":"Luis G.

Safe and effective operation of this type of robot requires that the robot's shaft avoid sensitive anatomical structures (e.g., critical vessels and organs) while the surgeon teleoperates the robot's tip. However, the robot's unintuitive kinematics makes it difficult for a human user to manually ensure obstacle avoidance along the entire tentacle-like shape of the robot's shaft. We present a motion planning approach for concentric tube robot teleoperation that enables the robot to interactively maneuver its tip to points selected by a user while automatically avoiding obstacles along its shaft. We achieve automatic collision avoidance by precomputing a roadmap of collision-free robot configurations based on a description of the anatomical obstacles, which are attainable via volumetric medical imaging. We also mitigate the effects of kinematic modeling error in reaching the goal positions by adjusting motions based on robot tip position sensing. We evaluate our motion planner on a teleoperated concentric tube robot and demonstrate its obstacle avoidance and accuracy in environments with tubular obstacles.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139513","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139513.pdf","startPage":"2361","endPage":"2367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motion planning approach to automatic obstacle avoidance during concentric tube robot teleoperation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A motion planning approach to automatic obstacle avoidance during concentric tube robot teleoperation","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286495","pubMedId":"26413381","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139513/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion planning approach to automatic obstacle avoidance during concentric tube robot teleoperation","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079748S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7139514,"authors":[{"name":"Edward Schmerling","affiliation":["Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Schmerling","id":"37085548931"},{"name":"Lucas Janson","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Janson","id":"37085552349"},{"name":"Marco Pavone","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Pavone","id":"37307912900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139514","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":727},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139514","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Planning","Probabilistic logic","Robots","Heuristic algorithms","Aerospace electronics","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","path planning","probability","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion planning","optimal sampling","differential constraints","driftless case","rapidly exploring random tree algorithm","sampling based algorithms","probabilistic RoadMap algorithm","differential fast marching tree algorithm","robotic systems","mathematical flexibility"]}],"abstract":"Motion planning under differential constraints is a classic problem in robotics.

In this paper we provide a thorough theoretical framework to assess optimality guarantees of sampling-based algorithms for planning under differential constraints. We exploit this framework to design and analyze two novel sampling-based algorithms that are guaranteed to converge, as the number of samples increases, to an optimal solution (namely, the Differential Probabilistic RoadMap algorithm and the Differential Fast Marching Tree algorithm). Our focus is on driftless control-affine dynamical models, which accurately model a large class of robotic systems. In this paper we use the notion of convergence in probability (as opposed to convergence almost surely): the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach yields convergence rate bounds - a first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints. Numerical experiments corroborating our theoretical results are presented and discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139514","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139514.pdf","startPage":"2368","endPage":"2375","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints: The driftless case","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints: The driftless case","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285936","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","pubMedId":"26618041","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139514/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints: The driftless case","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072332S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":7139537,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The main problem to deal with is the lack of an explicit parametrization of the non linear submanifold in the Configuration Space (CS) imposed by the constraints in the system. Most of the proposed planning methods use projections to generate valid configurations of the system slowing the planning process. Recently, new robot mechanism includes compliance either in the structure or in the controllers. In this kind of robot most of the times the planned trajectories are not executed exactly due to uncertainties and interactions with the environment. Indeed, controller references are generated such that the constraint is violated to indirectly generate forces during interactions. With the purpose of avoiding projections, in this paper we take advantage of the compliance of systems to relax the geometric constraints imposed by closed kinematic chains. The relaxed constraint is then used in a state-of-the-art suboptimal random sampling based technique to generate paths for constrained robot manipulators. As a consequence of relaxation, arising contact forces acting on the constraint change from configuration to configuration during the planned path. Those forces can be regulated using a proper controller that takes advantage of the geometric decoupling of the subspaces describing constrained rigid-body motions of the mechanism and the controllable forces.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139537","startPage":"2522","endPage":"2527","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139537.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample-based motion planning for robot manipulators with closed kinematic chains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sample-based motion planning for robot manipulators with closed kinematic chains","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139537/","accessionNumber":"15285949","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139537/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample-based motion planning for robot manipulators with closed kinematic chains","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061564S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139541,"authors":[{"name":"Frederick Largilliere","affiliation":["University of Lillis","INRIA, Shacra Team"],"firstName":"Frederick","lastName":"Largilliere","id":"37085493406"},{"name":"Valerian Verona","affiliation":["Telecom Physique Strasbourg","INRIA, Shacra Team"],"firstName":"Valerian","lastName":"Verona","id":"37085485967"},{"name":"Eulalie Coevoet","affiliation":["INRIA, Shacra Team"],"firstName":"Eulalie","lastName":"Coevoet","id":"37085480908"},{"name":"Mario Sanz-Lopez","affiliation":["INRIA, Shacra Team"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Sanz-Lopez","id":"37085492863"},{"name":"Jeremie Dequidt","affiliation":["University of Lillis","INRIA, Shacra Team"],"firstName":"Jeremie","lastName":"Dequidt","id":"37085426564"},{"name":"Christian Duriez","affiliation":["University of Lillis","INRIA, Shacra Team"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Duriez","id":"37428704500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139541","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":797},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Actuators","Computational modeling","Finite element analysis","Inverse problems","Trajectory","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformation","finite element analysis","inverse problems","matrix algebra","quadratic programming","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time control","soft-robots","asynchronous finite element modeling","finite element analysis","deformable models","real-time system","high-rate control","actuator","inverse problem","quadratic-programming algorithm","asynchronous simulation framework","deformation accuracy","computational burden","multirate simulation","evolution measurements","QP matrix","experimental validation"]}],"abstract":"Finite Element analysis can provide accurate deformable models for soft-robots.

In this paper, we introduce a generic solution that enables a high-rate control and that is compatible with strong real-time constraints. From a Finite Element analysis, computed at low rate, an inverse model of the robot outputs the setpoint values for the actuator in order to obtain a desired trajectory. This inverse problem uses a QP (quadratic-programming) algorithm based on the equations set by the Finite Element Method. To improve the update rate performances, we propose an asynchronous simulation framework that provides a better trade-off between the deformation accuracy and the computational burden. Complex computations such as accurate FEM deformations are done at low frequency while the control is performed at high frequency with strong real-time constraints. The two simulation loops (high frequency and low frequency loops) are mechanically coupled in order to guarantee mechanical accuracy of the system over time. Finally, the validity of the multi-rate simulation is discussed based on measurements of the evolution in the QP matrix and an experimental validation is conducted to validate the correctness of the high-rate inverse model on a real robot.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time control of soft-robots using asynchronous finite element modeling","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139541","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139541.pdf","startPage":"2550","endPage":"2555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Real-time control of soft-robots using asynchronous finite element modeling","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139541/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278247","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time control of soft-robots using asynchronous finite element modeling","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069553S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7139542,"authors":[{"name":"Farahnaz Maghooa","affiliation":["Engineering student with Polytech UPMC, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Farahnaz","lastName":"Maghooa","id":"37085527160"},{"name":"Agostino Stilli","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Robotics Research, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Agostino","lastName":"Stilli","id":"37085447649"},{"name":"Yohan Noh","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Robotics Research, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yohan","lastName":"Noh","id":"37085437433"},{"name":"Kaspar Althoefer","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Robotics Research, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Kaspar","lastName":"Althoefer","id":"37265264700"},{"name":"Helge A Wurdemann","affiliation":["King's College London, Centre for Robotics Research, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Helge A","lastName":"Wurdemann","id":"37991827000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139542","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1409},"abstract":"This paper proposes a soft, inflatable manipulator that is antagonistically actuated by tendons and pneumatics. The combination of the two actuation mechanisms in this antagonistic robot structure is inspired by the octopus which uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles to steer, elongate, shrink and also stiffen its continuum arms. By \u201cactivating\u201d its antagonistic muscle groups at the same time, the octopus can achieve multiple motion patterns as well as stiffen their arms. Being organized in a similar fashion, our robot manipulator uses, on the one hand, pneumatic actuation and, on the other hand, tendon-based actuation - one opposing the other, achieving an overall antagonistic actuation framework. Controlling the pressure inside the robot while at the same time controlling the tendons' displacements, the robot can be moved into a wide range of configurations while simultaneously controlling the arm's stiffness. This paper builds on earlier work by the authors: Here, we present a new conic-shaped manipulator structure and the control architecture. Using a constant curvature model, we have derived an approach suitable for controlling the robot manipulator. The manipulator's reachable workspace is analyzed and proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to show the robot's stiffness control and motion abilities.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139542.pdf","startPage":"2556","endPage":"2561","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tendon and pressure actuation for a bio-inspired manipulator based on an antagonistic principle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulators","Tendons","Bladder","Force","Pneumatic systems","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","manipulators","pneumatic actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pressure actuation","tendon actuation","bio-inspired manipulator","antagonistic robot structure","pneumatic actuation","tendon-based actuation","conic-shaped manipulator structure","control architecture","constant curvature model","robot stiffness control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Tendon and pressure actuation for a bio-inspired manipulator based on an antagonistic principle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139542/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285973","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tendon and pressure actuation for a bio-inspired manipulator based on an antagonistic principle","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057654S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139544,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Chossat","affiliation":["Ecole de Technologie Superieure, Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Chossat","id":"37072971400"},{"name":"Yiwei Tao","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering"],"lastName":"Yiwei Tao","id":"37085368560"},{"name":"Vincent Duchaine","affiliation":["Ecole de Technologie Superieure, Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Duchaine","id":"37293913400"},{"name":"Yong-Lae Park","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yong-Lae","lastName":"Park","id":"37600943600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139544","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1622},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Skin","Liquids","Joints","Microchannels","Strain","Metals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","conducting materials","elastomers","intelligent sensors","microchannel flow","microcontrollers","microsensors","motion measurement","sensor arrays","skin","strain measurement","strain sensors","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wearable soft artificial skin","hand motion detection","embedded microfluidic soft strain sensor array","hand gesture detection","joint motion measurement","hyperelastic elastomer material","embedded microchannel","ionic liquid microchannel","mechanical strain detection","liquid metal microchannel","electrical wire","external control circuit","heterogeneous liquid conductor","microcontroller instrumentation circuit","3D hand motion reconstruction","calibration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139544","abstract":"This paper describes the design and manufacturing of soft artificial skin with an array of embedded soft strain sensors for detecting various hand gestures by measuring joint motions of five fingers.

For user acceptance, such vehicles should not only be safe and reliable, they should also provide a comfortable user experience. However, individual perception of comfort may vary considerably among users. Whereas some users might prefer sporty driving with high accelerations, others might prefer a more relaxed style. Typically, a large number of parameters such as acceleration profiles, distances to other cars, speed during lane changes, etc., characterize a human driver's style. Manual tuning of these parameters may be a tedious and error-prone task. Therefore, we propose a learning from demonstration approach that allows the user to simply demonstrate the desired style by driving the car manually. We model the individual style in terms of a cost function and use feature-based inverse reinforcement learning to find the model parameters that fit the observed style best. Once the model has been learned, it can be used to efficiently compute trajectories for the vehicle in autonomous mode. We show that our approach is capable of learning cost functions and reproducing different driving styles using data from real drivers.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139555.pdf","startPage":"2641","endPage":"2646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139555","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning driving styles for autonomous vehicles from demonstration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning driving styles for autonomous vehicles from demonstration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139555/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139555/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286284","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning driving styles for autonomous vehicles from demonstration","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048002S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139563,"authors":[{"name":"Young Jin Heo","affiliation":["The Robotics Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyung-buk, Korea"],"lastName":"Young Jin Heo","id":"37085543955"},{"name":"Junsu Kang","affiliation":["The Robotics Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyung-buk, Korea"],"lastName":"Junsu Kang","id":"37085528607"},{"name":"Makoto Kaneko","affiliation":["The department of Mechanical Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37274087200"},{"name":"Wan Kyun Chung","affiliation":["The Robotics Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyung-buk, Korea"],"lastName":"Wan Kyun Chung","id":"37085528262"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139563","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"abstract":"We developed a `hybrid actuator system' to precisely control the position of a micro-particle at high speed in a microfluidic chip.

State-of-the-art approaches to vehicle localization rely on observing road surface reflectivity with a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanner to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. However, these approaches can often fail when faced with adverse weather conditions that obscure the view of the road paint (e.g., puddles and snowdrifts) or poor road surface texture. We propose a new scan matching algorithm that leverages Gaussian mixture maps to exploit the structure in the environment; these maps are a collection of Gaussian mixtures over the z-height distribution. We achieve real-time performance by developing a novel branch-and-bound, multiresolution approach that makes use of rasterized lookup tables of these Gaussian mixtures. Results are shown on two datasets that are 3.0 km: a standard trajectory and another under adverse weather conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139582","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139582.pdf","startPage":"2814","endPage":"2821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast LIDAR localization using multiresolution Gaussian mixture maps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast LIDAR localization using multiresolution Gaussian mixture maps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139582/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285935","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast LIDAR localization using multiresolution Gaussian mixture maps","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2830.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053719S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":7139597,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Polygerinos","affiliation":["Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Polygerinos","id":"37546532200"},{"name":"Kevin C.

In this work, we focus on finding valid folding motion that brings the origami from the unfolded state continuously to the folded state. Although recent computational methods allow rapid simulation of folding process of certain rigid origami, these methods can fail even when the input crease pattern is extremely simple but requires implicit folding orders. Moreover, due to the rigidity requirement, the probability of generating a valid configuration via uniform sampling is zero, which greatly hinders the applicability of traditional sampling-based motion planners. We propose a novel sampling strategy that samples in the discrete domain. Our experimental results show that the proposed method could efficiently generate valid configurations. Using those configurations, the planner successfully folds several types of rigid origami that the existing methods fail to fold and could discover multiple folding paths in different homotopies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139601/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286102","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Plan folding motion for rigid self-folding machine via discrete domain sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plan folding motion for rigid self-folding machine via discrete domain sampling","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053924S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139603,"authors":[{"name":"Kris Hauser","affiliation":["Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Kris","lastName":"Hauser","id":"37543748800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139603","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":714},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lazy collision checking in asymptotically-optimal motion planning","abstract":"Asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion planners, like RRT*, perform vast amounts of collision checking, and are hence rather slow to converge in complex problems where collision checking is relatively expensive. This paper presents two novel motion planners, Lazy-PRM* and Lazy-RRG*, that eliminate the majority of collision checks using a lazy strategy. They are sampling-based, any-time, and asymptotically complete algorithms that grow a network of feasible vertices connected by edges. Edges are not immediately checked for collision, but rather are checked only when a better path to the goal is found. This strategy avoids checking the vast majority of edges that have no chance of being on an optimal path. Experiments show that the new methods converge toward the optimum substantially faster than existing planners on rigid body path planning and robot manipulation problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","startPage":"2951","endPage":"2957","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139603.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139603","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Heuristic algorithms","Collision avoidance","Convergence","Robots","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lazy collision checking","asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion planners","RRT*","Lazy-PRM*","Lazy-RRG*","sampling-based algorithm","any-time algorithm","asymptotically complete algorithm","rigid body path planning problem","robot manipulation problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Lazy collision checking in asymptotically-optimal motion planning","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286579","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139603/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139603/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lazy collision checking in asymptotically-optimal motion planning","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064563S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":7139618,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085545929"},{"name":"Lynne E.

To address this challenging problem, we introduce a novel bio-inspired predictive orientation decomposition (BIPOD) approach to construct representations of people from 3D skeleton trajectories. Our approach is inspired by biological research in human anatomy. In order to capture spatio-temporal information of human motions, we spatially decompose 3D human skeleton trajectories and project them onto three anatomical planes (i.e., coronal, transverse and sagittal planes); then, we describe short-term time information of joint motions and encode high-order temporal dependencies. By estimating future skeleton trajectories that are not currently observed, we endow our BIPOD representation with the critical predictive capability. Empirical studies validate that our BIPOD approach obtains promising performance, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, using a physical TurtleBot2 robotic platform to recognize ongoing human activities. Experiments on benchmark datasets further demonstrate that our new BIPOD representation significantly outperforms previous approaches for real-time activity classification and prediction from 3D human skeleton trajectories.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139618","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139618.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","startPage":"3053","endPage":"3060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired predictive orientation decomposition of skeleton trajectories for real-time human activity prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired predictive orientation decomposition of skeleton trajectories for real-time human activity prediction","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139618/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278377","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139618/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired predictive orientation decomposition of skeleton trajectories for real-time human activity prediction","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063973S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139620,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan D.

We improve on current methods in two ways: first, we maintain a richer (higher-dimensional) representation of the terrain that is better able to distinguish between different training examples.

Helicopters are complex systems, coupling rigid body dynamics with aerodynamics, engine dynamics, vibration, and other phenomena. Resultantly, they pose a challenging system identification problem, especially when considering non-stationary flight regimes. We pose the dynamics modeling problem as direct high-dimensional regression, and take inspiration from recent results in Deep Learning to represent the helicopter dynamics with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Network Model, a hierarchical neural network model. We provide a simple method for initializing the parameters of the model, and optimization details for training. We describe three baseline models and show that they are significantly outperformed by the ReLU Network Model in experiments on real data, indicating the power of the model to capture useful structure in system dynamics across a rich array of aerobatic maneuvers. Specifically, the ReLU Network Model improves 58% overall in RMS acceleration prediction over state-of-the-art methods. Predicting acceleration along the helicopter's up-down axis is empirically found to be the most difficult, and the ReLU Network Model improves by 60% over the prior state-of-the-art. We discuss explanations of these performance gains, and also investigate the impact of hyperparameters in the novel model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139643/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15285978","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139643/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep learning helicopter dynamics models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning helicopter dynamics models","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051481S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7139679,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Maturana","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Maturana","id":"37540464600"},{"name":"Sebastian Scherer","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Scherer","id":"37584159000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139679","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Vegetation mapping","Laser radar","Safety","Solid modeling","Blades","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","air safety","autonomous aerial vehicles","helicopters","neural nets","object detection","optical radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D convolutional neural networks","landing zone detection","vegetated terrain","potentially obscured obstacle detection","CNN","volumetric occupancy map coupling","raw occupancy data","safe landing zone detection","autonomous helicopters","LiDAR point clouds","heuristic rules","geometric features","synthetic range data","real range data","hand-crafted point cloud features"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139679","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139679.pdf","startPage":"3471","endPage":"3478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Convolutional Neural Networks for landing zone detection from LiDAR","abstract":"We present a system for the detection of small and potentially obscured obstacles in vegetated terrain.

We apply this method to the problem of detecting safe landing zones for autonomous helicopters from LiDAR point clouds. Current methods for this problem rely on heuristic rules and use simple geometric features. These heuristics break down in the presence of low vegetation, as they do not distinguish between vegetation that may be landed on and solid objects that should be avoided.

The magnetized T. pyriformis cells are generated by adding iron-oxide spherical particles into the cells. We control the cells' moving direction by changing the magnetic field direction. Based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm, we define a cost function which is composed of the target cost function and the obstacle potential function. The target cost function is to measure the sum of differences between cells' predicted positions and their target positions. The obstacle potential function is used to measure the repulsive force of the obstacle. The input variables of the cost function are the sequence of control signals. We use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method to find a cost value which is close to the global minimum of the cost function. In the experimental result section, we show the control of three m3pi robots to move from their initial positions to their target positions with avoiding the obstacle. Since the similar control strategy has successfully controlled one T. pyriformis cell in our previous work, we believe our PSO-MPC algorithm is applicable on the multiple T. pyriformis cells' control task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139684/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15286088","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139684/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for simultaneous motion control of multiple T. pyriformis cells: Model predictive control and Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for simultaneous motion control of multiple T. pyriformis cells: Model predictive control and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085019S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7139699,"authors":[{"name":"Lauro J.

In order to make accurate estimation, the state transition model needs to be physically correct. Complementarity formulations of the dynamics are widely used for describing rigid body physical behaviors in the simulation field, which makes it a good state transition model for dynamic system states estimation problem. However, the non-smoothness of complementarity models and the high dimensionality of the dynamic system make the estimation problem challenging. In this paper, we propose a particle filtering framework that solves the estimation problem by sampling the discrete contact states using contact graphs and collision detection algorithms, and by estimating the continuous states through a Kalman filter. This method exploits the piecewise continuous property of complementarity problems and reduces the dimension of the sampling space compared with sampling the high dimensional continuous states space. We demonstrate that this method makes stable and reliable estimation in physical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139714","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139714.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139714","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","startPage":"3709","endPage":"3715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State estimation for dynamic systems with intermittent contact","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"State estimation for dynamic systems with intermittent contact","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139714/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139714/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286596","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State estimation for dynamic systems with intermittent contact","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060072S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7139760,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The main purpose is to control the aerial platform taking into account the presence of the moving manipulator. Three layers are considered in this work. First, a novel mechanism is proposed considering a moving battery to counterweight the statics of the robotic arm. Then, in order to overcome the mechanical limitations of the previous layer, the residual of the arm static effects on the UAV is computed and compensated through the given control thrust and torques. Finally, an estimator of external forces and moments acting on the aerial vehicle is considered and the estimations are fed back to the controller to compensate neglected aerodynamic effects and the arm dynamics. The performance of the proposed architecture has been experimentally evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139760","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139760.pdf","startPage":"4014","endPage":"4020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilayer control for multirotor UAVs equipped with a servo robot arm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multilayer control for multirotor UAVs equipped with a servo robot arm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139760/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286358","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilayer control for multirotor UAVs equipped with a servo robot arm","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062716S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7139773,"authors":[{"name":"Oren Salzman","affiliation":["Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Salzman","id":"37077497700"},{"name":"Dan Halperin","affiliation":["Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Halperin","id":"37355669200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139773","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":439},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139773","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision avoidance","Motion-planning","Estimation","Heuristic algorithms","Robots","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","robots","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotically-optimal motion planning","path-finding algorithms","heuristic function","sampling-based motion-planning algorithms","MPLB","motion planning using lower bounds","fast marching trees algorithm","FMT* algorithm","collision detection","nearest-neighbor queries","low-cost paths"]}],"abstract":"Many path-finding algorithms on graphs such as A* are sped up by using a heuristic function that gives lower bounds on the cost to reach the goal. Aiming to apply similar techniques to speed up sampling-based motion-planning algorithms, we use effective lower bounds on the cost between configurations to tightly estimate the cost-to-go. We then use these estimates in an anytime asymptotically-optimal algorithm which we call Motion Planning using Lower Bounds (MPLB). MPLB is based on the Fast Marching Trees (FMT*) algorithm [1] recently presented by Janson and Pavone. An advantage of our approach is that in many cases (especially as the number of samples grows) the weight of collision detection in the computation is almost negligible compared to the weight of nearest-neighbor queries. We prove that MPLB performs no more collision-detection calls than an anytime version of FMT*. Additionally, we demonstrate in simulations that for certain scenarios, the algorithmic tools presented here enable efficiently producing low-cost paths while spending only a small fraction of the running time on collision detection.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139773","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139773.pdf","startPage":"4167","endPage":"4172","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotically-optimal Motion Planning using lower bounds on cost","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotically-optimal Motion Planning using lower bounds on cost","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139773/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286265","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139773/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotically-optimal Motion Planning using lower bounds on cost","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076155S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139775,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Dobson","affiliation":["Computer Science, Rutgers University, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Dobson","id":"37077149800"},{"name":"George V.

Optimal sampling-based planners like RRT*, FMT*, and BIT* when applied to kinodynamic systems require solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) to perform exact connections between nodes in the tree. Two-point BVPs are non-trivial to solve, hence the prevalence of alternative approaches that focus on specific instances of kinodynamic systems, use approximate solutions to the two-point BVP, or use random propagation of controls. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting recent advances in numerical optimal control and optimization to solve these two-point BVPs for arbitrary kinodynamic systems and how they can be integrated with existing optimal planning algorithms. We combine BIT* with a two-point BVP solver that uses sequential quadratic programming (SQP). We consider the problem of computing minimum-time trajectories. Since the duration of trajectories is not known a-priori, we include the time-step as part of the optimization to allow SQP to optimize over the duration of the trajectory while keeping the number of discrete steps fixed for every connection attempted. Our experiments indicate that using a two-point BVP solver in the inner-loop of BIT* is competitive with the state-of-the-art in sampling-based optimal planning that explicitly avoids the use of two-point BVP solvers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139776/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278273","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Toward asymptotically optimal motion planning for kinodynamic systems using a two-point boundary value problem solver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward asymptotically optimal motion planning for kinodynamic systems using a two-point boundary value problem solver","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060625S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139777,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong hwan Jeon","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeong hwan","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37534489800"},{"name":"Sertac Karaman","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sertac","lastName":"Karaman","id":"37304113000"},{"name":"Emilio Frazzoli","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Frazzoli","id":"37283368500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139777","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Linear systems","Polynomials","Optimization","Aerospace electronics","Boundary conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","linear programming","linear systems","mobile robots","quadratic programming","sampling methods","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal sampling-based feedback motion trees","controllable linear systems","linear constraints","RRT* algorithm","rapidly-exploring random trees","goal-rooted feedback motion trees","GR-FMTs","collision-free feedback policies","optimal local steering","asymptotically optimal trajectories","polynomial basis functions","linear programming","quadratic programming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139777","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139777.pdf","startPage":"4195","endPage":"4201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal sampling-based Feedback Motion Trees among obstacles for controllable linear systems with linear constraints","abstract":"The RRT* algorithm has efficiently extended Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) to endow it with asymptotic optimality.

This requires the development of a new computational framework that exploits not only the spatial information, like in the traditional frame-based approach, but also the temporal content of the sensory data. We propose a method for unsupervised learning of filters for the processing of the visual signal from event-driven sensors. This method exploits the temporal coincidence of events generated by each object in a spatial location of the visual field. The approach is based on a modification of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity that takes into account the specific implementation on the robot and the characteristics of the used sensor. It gives rise to oriented spatial filters that are very similar to the receptive fields observed in the primary visual cortex and traditionally used in bio-inspired hierarchical structures for object recognition, as well as to novel curved spatial structures. Using mutual information measure we provide a quantitative evidence that such curved spatial filters provide more information than equivalent oriented Gabor filters and can be an important aspect for object recognition in robotic applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139786","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139786.pdf","startPage":"4258","endPage":"4264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139786/","displayDocTitle":"Spike time based unsupervised learning of receptive fields for event-driven vision","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286145","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139786/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spike time based unsupervised learning of receptive fields for event-driven vision","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062006S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7139793,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Kappler","affiliation":["Autonomous Motion Department at the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems, T\u00fcbingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Kappler","id":"37992308100"},{"name":"Jeannette Bohg","affiliation":["Autonomous Motion Department at the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems, T\u00fcbingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jeannette","lastName":"Bohg","id":"37591153900"},{"name":"Stefan Schaal","affiliation":["Autonomous Motion Department at the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems, T\u00fcbingen, Germany","Computational Learning and Motor Control lab at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schaal","id":"37282144700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139793","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Robots","Shape","Three-dimensional displays","Stability analysis","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","control engineering computing","database management systems","grippers","planning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","grasp planning","large-scale database","physics simulation","physics-metric","learning method","logistic regression"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new large-scale database containing grasps that are applied to a large set of objects from numerous categories.

We use a descriptive and efficient representation of the local object shape at which each grasp is applied. Given this data, we present a two-fold analysis: (i) We use crowdsourcing to analyze the correlation of the metrics with grasp success as predicted by humans. The results show that the metric based on physics simulation is a more consistent predictor for grasp success than the standard \u03c5-metric. The results also support the hypothesis that human labels are not required for good ground truth grasp data. Instead the physics-metric can be used to generate datasets in simulation that may then be used to bootstrap learning in the real world. (ii) We apply a deep learning method and show that it can better leverage the large-scale database for prediction of grasp success compared to logistic regression. Furthermore, the results suggest that labels based on the physics-metric are less noisy than those from the \u03c5-metric and therefore lead to a better classification performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139793","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","startPage":"4304","endPage":"4311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging big data for grasp planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging big data for grasp planning","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139793/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278327","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139793/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging big data for grasp planning","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081198S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139799,"authors":[{"name":"Michael J\u00e4ntsch","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"J\u00e4ntsch","id":"37595257500"},{"name":"Steffen Wittmeier","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Wittmeier","id":"37586917700"},{"name":"Konstantinos Dalamagkidis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Dalamagkidis","id":"37300806300"},{"name":"Guido Herrmann","affiliation":["University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Herrmann","id":"37284937100"},{"name":"Alois Knoll","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich"],"firstName":"Alois","lastName":"Knoll","id":"37276234100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139799","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139799","abstract":"The soft robotics approach is widely considered to enable robots in the near future to leave their cages and move freely in our modern homes and manufacturing sites.

The modeling relies on a discretization of the continuum robots using 6 DoFs Frames along the structure of the robot that is compatible with the modeling of a sequence of rigid vertebras. When the robot's structure relies on rods with constant sections, internal forces are computed with beam elements, placed between two adjacent frames, that applies forces and torques. In the opposite, when the robot is composed of a complex shape deformable backbone separated by the rigid vertebras, a domain decomposition strategy is used to obtain an equivalent stiffness between two vertebras using volumetric FEM. In both cases, for solving the whole robot model and inverting it in real-time, the numerical method takes advantage of the serial nature of continuum robots, using a Block-Tri-Diagonal solver. The factor of improvement in the computation time reaches several order of magnitude compared to a classical FEM model, while keeping a good precision. The method has also been implemented and tested on a real pneumatic CBHA trunk designed by Festo Robotics and some complementarity examples have been generated numerically.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139803.pdf","startPage":"4373","endPage":"4378","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain decomposition approach for FEM quasistatic modeling and control of Continuum Robots with rigid vertebras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Computational modeling","Actuators","Finite element analysis","Pneumatic systems","Deformable models","Tendons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","finite element analysis","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain decomposition approach","quasistatic modeling","continuum robots","rigid vertebras","finite element method","6 DoF frames","constant sections","internal forces","beam elements","complex shape deformable backbone","equivalent stiffness","volumetric FEM","real-time","numerical method","block-tridiagonal solver","computation time","pneumatic CBHA trunk","Festo robotics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Domain decomposition approach for FEM quasistatic modeling and control of Continuum Robots with rigid vertebras","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139803/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286304","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain decomposition approach for FEM quasistatic modeling and control of Continuum Robots with rigid vertebras","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05039S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139812,"authors":[{"name":"Angelica Ruszkowski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Angelica","lastName":"Ruszkowski","id":"37085493796"},{"name":"Omid Mohareri","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Mohareri","id":"37568797800"},{"name":"Sam Lichtenstein","affiliation":["Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Lichtenstein","id":"38124409400"},{"name":"Richard Cook","affiliation":["Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Cook","id":"37085480657"},{"name":"Septimiu Salcudean","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Septimiu","lastName":"Salcudean","id":"37375034700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139812","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Trajectory","Tracking","Surgery","Cameras","Accuracy","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood vessels","manipulators","medical robotics","motion compensation","object tracking","open loop systems","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["daVinci surgical robot","coronary artery bypass surgery","heart motion compensation system","da Vinci surgical system","robot-assisted solution","open loop controllers","spectral line decomposition","periodic trajectory assumption","da Vinci patient-side manipulators","heart trajectory tracking","sub-millimetre error","virtually stabilized environment simulation","camera","vision tracking","arm tracking","peg transfer tasks","surgeon ability evaluation","task completion time","needle placement accuracy"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the implementation of a heart motion compensation system on the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc.) for coronary artery bypass surgery. By introducing a robot-assisted solution, this surgery could be performed completely minimally invasively and on a beating heart. In this work we describe the development of open loop controllers based on spectral line decomposition and the assumption of a periodic trajectory. This allows the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track an actual heart trajectory with sub-millimetre error. Further, to simulate a virtually stabilized environment, we present the novel concept of maintaining the camera fixed relative to the heart target, effectively decoupling the vision tracking and arm tracking challenges. Finally, we executed preliminary experiments to evaluate surgeons' ability to perform simulated suturing and peg transfer tasks on a moving target. Performance for the simulated suturing was evaluated based on task completion time, accuracy of needle placement, and number of errors. For the suture task, the number of missed targets decreased from 37% to 13% when compensation was enabled, the number of hit targets increased from 26% to 41%, and completion time decreased. For the peg transfer tasks, again completion time and number of errors were measured. Though the margin for error was larger, there was less perceived difficulty of the task when compensation was enabled.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the feasibility of heart motion compensation on the daVinci\u00ae surgical robot for coronary artery bypass surgery: Implementation and user studies","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139812","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139812.pdf","startPage":"4432","endPage":"4439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the feasibility of heart motion compensation on the daVinci\u00ae surgical robot for coronary artery bypass surgery: Implementation and user studies","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139812/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278329","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the feasibility of heart motion compensation on the daVinci\u00ae surgical robot for coronary artery bypass surgery: Implementation and user studies","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073624S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139828,"authors":[{"name":"Duncan W.

The convergence of these algorithms can be improved if sampling is guided toward the most promising region of the search space where the solution is more likely to be found. In this paper we propose three sample rejection methods that leverage the classification of the samples according to their potential of being part of the optimal solution to guide the exploration of the motion planner to promising regions of the search space. These sampling strategies are a direct by-product of the exploitation phase of the algorithm, which uses a dynamic programming (DP) step while planning on random graphs as, for example, is done in the RRT# algorithm. It is shown that the proposed sampling strategies are able to compute high-quality solutions, much faster than existing algorithms. We provide numerical results and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the original RRT# and the RRT* algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139869","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139869.pdf","startPage":"4819","endPage":"4826","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic programming guided exploration for sampling-based motion planning algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic programming guided exploration for sampling-based motion planning algorithms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7139869/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286106","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139869/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic programming guided exploration for sampling-based motion planning algorithms","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058651S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7139875,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Wolf","affiliation":["Vision4Robotics Group at the Automation & Control Institute, Technical University of Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37075963400"},{"name":"Johann Prankl","affiliation":["Vision4Robotics Group at the Automation & Control Institute, Technical University of Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Johann","lastName":"Prankl","id":"37670695700"},{"name":"Markus Vincze","affiliation":["Vision4Robotics Group at the Automation & Control Institute, Technical University of Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Vincze","id":"37269163100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139875","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Accuracy","Kernel","Labeling","Semantics","Training","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image segmentation","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic segmentation framework","indoor scenes","3D point clouds","random forest classifier","conditional random field","NYU Depth datasets","CRF inference method","mean field approximation","Kinect point clouds"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139875","abstract":"In this paper, we present an efficient semantic segmentation framework for indoor scenes operating on 3D point clouds.

Unlike standard CMOS cameras, a DVS only transmits pixel-level brightness changes (\u201cevents\u201d) at the time they occur with micro-second resolution. Due to its low latency and sparse output, this sensor is very promising for high-speed mobile robotic applications. We develop an algorithm that augments each event with its lifetime, which is computed from the event's velocity on the image plane. The generated stream of augmented events gives a continuous representation of events in time, hence enabling the design of new algorithms that outperform those based on the accumulation of events over fixed, artificially-chosen time intervals. A direct application of this augmented stream is the construction of sharp gradient (edge-like) images at any time instant. We successfully demonstrate our method in different scenarios, including high-speed quadrotor flips, and compare it to standard visualization methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lifetime estimation of events from Dynamic Vision Sensors","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139876","endPage":"4881","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139876.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","startPage":"4874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139876","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Sensors","Cameras","Standards","Noise","Brightness","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lifetime estimation","dynamic vision sensors","DVS","retinal cameras","pixel-level brightness changes","microsecond resolution","high-speed mobile robotic applications","image plane","augmented events","time intervals","augmented stream","gradient images","edge-like images","quadrotor flips","standard visualization methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lifetime estimation of events from Dynamic Vision Sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139876/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15286244","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lifetime estimation of events from Dynamic Vision Sensors","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064312S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7139884,"authors":[{"name":"Theodoros Stouraitis","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics in the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Theodoros","lastName":"Stouraitis","id":"37085549243"},{"name":"Ulrich Hillenbrand","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics in the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Hillenbrand","id":"37295470000"},{"name":"M\u00e1ximo A.

Experimental trials show that this framework allows us to traverse terrains at nearly 6 times the speed of our previous work, evaluated over the same set of trials.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139916","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139916.pdf","startPage":"5148","endPage":"5154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning and execution of dynamic whole-body locomotion for a hydraulic quadruped on challenging terrain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139916/","displayDocTitle":"Planning and execution of dynamic whole-body locomotion for a hydraulic quadruped on challenging terrain","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278296","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139916/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning and execution of dynamic whole-body locomotion for a hydraulic quadruped on challenging terrain","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062591S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139939,"authors":[{"name":"Shaojie Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shaojie","lastName":"Shen","id":"37954847200"},{"name":"Nathan Michael","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Michael","id":"37302499000"},{"name":"Vijay Kumar","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37280341400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139939","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":4331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Optimization","Robot sensing systems","Vehicles","Quaternions","Measurement uncertainty","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","autonomous aerial vehicles","cameras","helicopters","mobile robots","nonlinear programming","pitch control (position)","sensor fusion","statistical analysis","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tightly-coupled monocular visual-inertial fusion","autonomous flight","robotics community","autonomous micro aerial vehicle","monocular visual-inertial system","camera","inertial measurement unit","IMU","size weight and power characteristics","SWaP characteristics","tightly-coupled nonlinear optimization-based monocular VINS estimator","autonomous rotorcraft MAV","trajectory","roll angle","pitch angle","statistical analysis","flight speed"]}],"abstract":"There have been increasing interests in the robotics community in building smaller and more agile autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). In particular, the monocular visual-inertial system (VINS) that consists of only a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) forms a great minimum sensor suite due to its superior size, weight, and power (SWaP) characteristics. In this paper, we present a tightly-coupled nonlinear optimization-based monocular VINS estimator for autonomous rotorcraft MAVs. Our estimator allows the MAV to execute trajectories at 2 m/s with roll and pitch angles up to 30 degrees. We present extensive statistical analysis to verify the performance of our approach in different environments with varying flight speeds.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139939","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139939.pdf","startPage":"5303","endPage":"5310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tightly-coupled monocular visual-inertial fusion for autonomous flight of rotorcraft MAVs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139939/","displayDocTitle":"Tightly-coupled monocular visual-inertial fusion for autonomous flight of rotorcraft MAVs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278246","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139939/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tightly-coupled monocular visual-inertial fusion for autonomous flight of rotorcraft MAVs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093955S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7139944,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen-Qiu Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen-Qiu","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085421600"},{"name":"Gui-Bin Bian","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gui-Bin","lastName":"Bian","id":"37540363100"},{"name":"Xiao-Liang Xie","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Liang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37533295000"},{"name":"Zeng-Guang Hou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zeng-Guang","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085469203"},{"name":"Jian-Long Hao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jian-Long Hao","id":"37087797240"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139944","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Catheters","Surgery","Trajectory","Robot sensing systems","Magnetic resonance imaging","Thumb"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator kinematics","medical robotics","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired robotic hand","percutaneous coronary intervention","complex operating skills","interventional devices","heavy X-ray radiation","surgeons","dedicated dual-finger robotic hand","DRH","PCI procedures","master-slave way","kinematics","catheter tip placement","balloon-stent catheter"]}],"abstract":"The percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) require complex operating skills of the interventional devices and make the surgeons being exposed to heavy X-ray radiation. Accurate delivery of the interventional devices and avoiding the radiation are especially important for the surgeons. This paper presents a novel dedicated dual-finger robotic hand (DRH) and a console to assist the surgeons to deliver the interventional devices in PCIs. The system is designed in the master-slave way which helps the surgeons to reduce the exposure to radiation. The mechanism of the DRH is bio-inspired and motions are decoupled in kinematics. In PCI procedures, the accuracy of the guidewire delivery and the catheter tip placement have significant effects on the surgical results. The performances of the DRH in delivering the guidewire and the balloon/stent catheter were evaluated by three surgical manipulations. The results show that the DRH has the ability to deliver the guidewire and the balloon/stent catheter precisely.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and evaluation of a bio-inspired robotic hand for percutaneous coronary intervention","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139944","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139944.pdf","startPage":"5338","endPage":"5343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of a bio-inspired robotic hand for percutaneous coronary intervention","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139944/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278272","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of a bio-inspired robotic hand for percutaneous coronary intervention","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065594S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139950,"authors":[{"name":"Philip J.

Transoral access is preferable to traditional between-the-ribs needle insertion because it is less invasive and reduces risk of lung collapse. Yet many sites in the peripheral zones of the lung or distant from the bronchi cannot currently be accessed transorally, due to the relatively large diameter and lack of sufficient steerablity of current instrumentation. To remedy this, we propose a new robotic system that uses a tendon-actuated device (bronchoscope) as a first stage for deploying a concentric tube robot, which itself is a vehicle through which a bevel steered needle can be introduced into the soft tissue of the lung outside the bronchi. In this paper we present the various components of the system and the workflow we envision for deploying the robot to a target using image guidance. We describe initial validation experiments in which we puncture ex vivo bronchial wall tissue and also target a nodule in a phantom with an average final tip error of 0.72 mm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139950.pdf","startPage":"5378","endPage":"5383","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tendons, concentric tubes, and a bevel tip: Three steerable robots in one transoral lung access system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","Needles","Robots","Lungs","Phantoms","Surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","lung","medical robotics","patient diagnosis","patient treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three steerable robots","bevel tip","Tendons","transoral lung access system","lung cancer","early stage diagnosis","early stage treatment","ribs needle insertion","lung collapse","peripheral zones","Bronchi","tendon actuated device","bronchoscope","concentric tube robot","soft tissue","image guidance","vivo bronchial"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Tendons, concentric tubes, and a bevel tip: Three steerable robots in one transoral lung access system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139950/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286185","pubMedId":"26157600","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tendons, concentric tubes, and a bevel tip: Three steerable robots in one transoral lung access system","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059279S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7139968,"authors":[{"name":"Suseong Kim","affiliation":["SMechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suseong","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239728400"},{"name":"Hoseong Seo","affiliation":["SMechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hoseong Seo","id":"37087602657"},{"name":"H.

To accommodate practical applications, it is assumed that the direction of motion and mechanical properties of the drawer are not given beforehand. A multirotor combined with a robotic arm is used for the manipulation task. Typical drawers are allowed to move in only one direction, which constrains the motion of the aerial manipulator while operating a drawer. To analyze this interaction, the dynamic characteristics of the aerial manipulator are modeled. Also, configuration of the aerial manipulator for exerting the desired force to a drawer is presented. To handle the uncertainties associated with the mechanism of a drawer, strategies exploiting velocity of the end effector are employed. The proposed approach is validated with experiments including opening and closing a common drawer, which is detected by a camera mounted in the palm of the end effector.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Force","Dynamics","End effectors","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","aerospace robotics","manipulators","motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unknown drawer","aerial manipulator","mechanical properties","motion properties","multirotor","robotic arm","dynamic characteristics","end effector"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139968","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07139968.pdf","startPage":"5503","endPage":"5508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operating an unknown drawer using an aerial manipulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Operating an unknown drawer using an aerial manipulator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7139968/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7139968/","accessionNumber":"15278225","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operating an unknown drawer using an aerial manipulator","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060465S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7139968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7139990,"authors":[{"name":"Adri\u00e0 Colom\u00e9","affiliation":["Institut de Rob\u00f2tica i Inform\u00e0tica Industrial (UPC-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Adri\u00e0","lastName":"Colom\u00e9","id":"38540317200"},{"name":"Antoni Planells","affiliation":["Institut de Rob\u00f2tica i Inform\u00e0tica Industrial (UPC-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Antoni","lastName":"Planells","id":"37085562819"},{"name":"Carme Torras","affiliation":["Institut de Rob\u00f2tica i Inform\u00e0tica Industrial (UPC-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Carme","lastName":"Torras","id":"37354713800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7139990","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139990","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Friction","Joints","Trajectory","Torque","Acceleration","Dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["friction","human-robot interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)","motion control","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["friction-model-based framework","reinforcement learning","robotic tasks","nonrigid environments","motion task learning","deformable objects","motion characterization","compliant robot controller","RL algorithm","safety-critical robotic tasks","compliant controller","inverse dynamic model","IDM","friction hystheresis","Barrett WAM","robot joints","friction-aware controller","dynamic movement primitives","DMP","visual-force feedback","RL algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Learning motion tasks in a real environment with deformable objects requires not only a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, but also a good motion characterization, a preferably compliant robot controller, and an agent giving feedback for the rewards/costs in the RL algorithm.
