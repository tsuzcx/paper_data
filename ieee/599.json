Among them, monitoring in unlicensed frequency bands of the environment and historical sites assumes particular relevance. However, these bands are becoming more and more overcrowded due to the fast growth of wireless services relying on them. A possible solution to overcome this problem is offered by the so-called Cognitive Radio (CR) technologies. According to the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) paradigm, nodes of one WSN can act as Secondary Users (SUs) accessing the unused portion of one licensed spectrum band. This is admitted provided that harmful interference to the licensees, namely the Primary Users (PUs), is avoided. In this paper, we describe how WSNs using DSA can be employed for applications of environment and cultural heritage monitoring. We show by system simulation that underlay CR techniques are well-suited to this kind of applications, allowing sensor nodes to continuously perform sensing data exchange while coexisting with primary systems.","doi":"10.1109/WETICE.2011.42","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 20th International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises","pdfPath":"/iel5/5988846/5989999/05990061.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WETICE.2011.42","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 20th International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises","startPage":"244","endPage":"249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Techniques for Preservation of Environment and Cultural Heritage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Techniques for Preservation of Environment and Cultural Heritage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990061/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990061/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12191244","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Techniques for Preservation of Environment and Cultural Heritage","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"4410a244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049461S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5988846","isNumber":"5989999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5988846","xplore-issue":"5989999","articleId":"5990061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5990092,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiwang Li","affiliation":["Surveying and Mapping Institute of Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China"],"firstName":"Shuiwang","lastName":"Li","id":"37963745500"},{"name":"Liguo Ding","affiliation":["Surveying and Mapping Institute of Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China"],"firstName":"Liguo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37951447300"},{"name":"Xiong Wei","firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Wei","id":"37087958709"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0856-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0855-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0854-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5990092","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics","Feature extraction","Biological neural networks","Training","Neurons","Object recognition","Geographic Information Systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cartography","computer graphics","handwritten character recognition","image recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online hand-drawn graphical symbol recognition","neural networkBP neural network","intelligent graphics recognition","electronic map","online identification method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990092","abstract":"The on-line recognition of hand-drawn graphical symbol is an intelligent graphics recognition, it can help people mark the symbols on the electronic map quickly and efficiently.

Meanwhile the space for searching is effectively compressed applying the heuristic rule and convergence is acceptable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12191390","htmlLink":"/document/5990223/","conferenceDate":"17-18 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"The GA Solution of Dynamic Spectrum Allocation in Cognitive Radio Based on Collaboration and Fairness","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The GA Solution of Dynamic Spectrum Allocation in Cognitive Radio Based on Collaboration and Fairness","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.979737S","chronDate":"17-18 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5989730","isNumber":"5990080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5989730","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5990080","articleId":"5990223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990268,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37402208500"},{"name":"Qiongxin Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiongxin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37066424900"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38244408600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0856-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0855-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0854-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5990268","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990268","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Indexes","Decision making","Encoding","Simulated annealing","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","genetic algorithms","matrix algebra","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiattribute decision making approach","subjective judgment","judgment matrix consistency modification","AHP","nonlinear programming model","analytic hierarchy process","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PACCS.2011.5990268","pdfPath":"/iel5/5989730/5990080/05990268.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Third Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and System (PACCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third Pacific-Asia Conference on Circuits, Communications and System (PACCS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACCS.2011.5990268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistency Modification of Judgment Matrix Based on Genetic Algorithm in Analytic Hierarchy Process","abstract":"Analytic hierarchy process is very extensive in decision-making of many objects and widely used in many fields as a classical multi attribute decision-making approach.

In some applications, such as in spectrum sensing for cognitive radio, perfect signal reconstruction is not really needed. Instead, only statistical measures such as the power spectrum or equivalently the auto-correlation sequence are required. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for reconstructing the power spectrum based on samples produced by sub-Nyquist rate sampling. Depending on the compression rate, the entire problem can be presented as either under-determined or over-determined. In this paper, we mainly focus on the over-determined case, which allows us to employ a simple least-squares (LS) reconstruction method. We show under which conditions this LS reconstruction method yields a unique solution, without including any sparsity constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990334/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182757","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wideband power spectrum sensing using sub-Nyquist sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband power spectrum sensing using sub-Nyquist sampling","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p101ariananda.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055349S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5990373,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Chaudhari","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Chaudhari","id":"37409477600"},{"name":"Jarmo Lund\u00e9n","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland","Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Lund\u00e9n","id":"37304324400"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["SMARAD CoE, Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990373","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Correlation","Entropy","Lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","error statistics","quantisation (signal)","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft decision based cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","primary user signal distribution","bit error probability wall phenomenon","BEP walls","performance constraints","fusion center","quantization effects"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of quantization on bepwalls for soft decision based cooperative sensing","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","endPage":"110","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990373","startPage":"106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990373","abstract":"This paper focuses on the performance limitations for soft decision (SD) based cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radios. Cooperative sensing (CS) is formulated as a composite hypothesis problem where we assume that the distribution of the primary user signal is not known. CS suffers from the Bit Error Probability (BEP) wall phenomenon in the presence of reporting channel errors. If the BEP value of the reporting channels is greater than the so called BEP wall value, then it is impossible to satisfy the imposed performance constraints on the CS at the fusion center even if the sensed signal quality or the sensing time at the secondary user is increased. In this paper, we specifically analyze the effects of quantization on the BEP wall for the case of SD based CS. It is shown that the choice of quantization scheme significantly affects the BEP wall value and needs to be paid sufficient attention during the design of practical cooperative sensing schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12190605","htmlLink":"/document/5990373/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Effects of quantization on bepwalls for soft decision based cooperative sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of quantization on bepwalls for soft decision based cooperative sensing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p106chaudhari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115431S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990375,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Imtiaz Hussain","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Syed Imtiaz","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37544466200"},{"name":"Mohamed M.

This constraint limits their transmission power and eventually the area of coverage. Therefore, it is very likely that the underlay networks will make use of relays to transmit signals to the distant secondary users. In this paper, we propose a secondary relay selection scheme which maximizes the end-to-end signal to noise ratio (SNR) for the secondary link while keeping the interference levels to the primary network below a certain threshold. We derive closed form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the SNR at the secondary destination, average bit error probability and outage probability. Analytical results are verified through simulations which also give insight about the benefits and tradeoffs of the selective cooperation in underlay cognitive networks. It is shown that, in contrast to non-cognitive selective cooperation, this scheme performs better in low SNR region for cognitive networks.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990375","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990375.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990375","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of selective cooperation in underlay cognitive networks over Rayleigh channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of selective cooperation in underlay cognitive networks over Rayleigh channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990375/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190606","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of selective cooperation in underlay cognitive networks over Rayleigh channels","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p116hussain.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05635S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5990376,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Yan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Huang Yan Yan","id":"38253992800"},{"name":"Peng Hua","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Peng Hua","id":"37845239400"},{"name":"Li Jian Qiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Li Jian Qiang","id":"38256105400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990376","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Estimation","Phase locked loops","Joints","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","frequency estimation","Monte Carlo methods","parameter estimation","phase locked loops","quadrature amplitude modulation","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint algorithm","blind Doppler parameter estimation","high order QAM signal","satellite communication","Doppler-rate estimation","cyclic statistical test","phase difference","cyclic frequency","quartic frequency offset","Doppler frequency","data division method","phase lock loop","Monte-Carlo simulation","time-varying frequency tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic-Statistical Tests","QAM signals","Doppler frequency","Doppler-rate","PLL"]}],"abstract":"Aiming at the difficulties of blind doppler parameters estimation for QAM signals in the satellite communication on-the-move (SCOTM) system, a new joint algorithm of blind doppler frequency and doppler-rate estimation based on cyclic-statistical tests and phase difference is proposed.

The analysis is based on Tauberian theorem and its underlying mathematical theory called regular variation, and applies to a wide range of channel distributions. It is proved that the diversity order being d and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the channel power gain having variation exponent d at 0 imply each other, provided that the instantaneous error rate is upper bounded by an exponential function of the instantaneous SNR. This establishes a sufficient condition for the outage event to dominate the error rate performance. Also, asymptotic error rate expressions are derived for practical cases of instantaneous error rate at high average SNR, and turn out to be related to the CDF of the channel power gain in a much simpler manner than existing results. In addition, the high-SNR asymptotic error rate is also characterized under diversity combining schemes, showing the advantage of the approach used herein for analyzing communication systems involving multiple random variables.

In this paper we consider a downlink multicell scenario with constraints on the backhaul throughput and BSs employing beamforming and QAM constellations. As for each mobile terminal (MT) the auxiliary BSs know only a partial version of data, we propose a transmission scheme where a quantized QAM symbol is transmitted cooperatively by all the BSs in the network, while the serving BS transmits an additional signal in order to allow the detection of the full QAM symbol at the receiver. We formulate the problem of maximizing the network spectral efficiency optimizing for each MT a) the QAM constellation size and b) the quantization rate.

While much prior work modeled the UWB channel as sparse, recent propagation studies suggest that, due to certain forms of scattering, a hybrid model, composed of both sparse and so-called diffuse components, is more appropriate. This new model is exploited to develop new channel estimation strategies based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. A theorem is provided which states the convergence of the iterative estimator for the sparsity level. The newly developed algorithms are compared to other schemes including recently popularized sparse approximation methods. Simulation results show that the new methods outperform the prior techniques which do not exploit the intrinsic nature of UWB propagation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","startPage":"201","endPage":"205","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990395.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid sparse/diffuse UWB channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990395/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid sparse/diffuse UWB channel estimation","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190611","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid sparse/diffuse UWB channel estimation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p201michelusi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080195S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990399,"authors":[{"name":"A Anil Kumar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"A Anil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37082612700"},{"name":"Anamitra Makur","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Anamitra","lastName":"Makur","id":"37266951200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990399","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Noise","Quantization","Discrete Fourier transforms","Multiple signal classification","Encoding","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","decoding","discrete Fourier transforms","Hermitian matrices","parity check codes","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity subspace","real BCH DFT decoding algorithm","RBDFT code","generator matrix","parity check matrix","complex arithmetic operation","real message vector","Hermitian symmetric structure","alternative subspace based formulation","real Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem discrete Fourier transform decoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Decoding of real BCH DFT (RBDFT) codes is considered in this paper. RBDFT codes find applications in several areas. Though the generator matrix of RBDFT codes is real, the parity check matrix is still complex, because of which complex arithmetic operations are necessary at the decoder. But for a real message vector, the syndromes of RBDFT code preserve Hermitian symmetry. This Hermitian symmetric structure is exploited and a new alternative subspace based formulation is proposed in this paper. The performance of the proposed formulation is identical to the current state-of-art RBDFT decoding algorithm, while it requires only real arithmetic operations. Simulation results are provided which demonstrates the reduction in the decoding complexity with no degradation in the performance.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990399","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990399.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A lowcomplexity subspace based decoding algorithm for real BCH DFT codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A lowcomplexity subspace based decoding algorithm for real BCH DFT codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990399/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12190615","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990399/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A lowcomplexity subspace based decoding algorithm for real BCH DFT codes","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p21anilkumar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044569S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5990400,"authors":[{"name":"Nico Aerts","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Aerts","id":"37586517100"},{"name":"Iancu Avram","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Iancu","lastName":"Avram","id":"37586493700"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37269902700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990400","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990400","abstract":"Several diversity techniques have been proposed to counteract the effect of fading on the error performance of wireless networks. A recent and promising technique, which achieves spatial diversity without increased hardware demands, is cooperative communication, involving other terminals in the network that relay the information broadcasted by the source terminal to the destination terminal. In literature several cooperative protocols have been studied under the simplifying assumption that all channel state information is available at the destination.

In order to exploit these channel-tap structures, we adopt a two-state Gaussian mixture prior in conjunction with a Markov model on the hidden state. For loopy belief propagation, we exploit a \"generalized approximate message passing\" algorithm recently developed in the context of compressed sensing, and show that it can be success fully coupled with soft-input soft-output decoding, as well as hidden Markov inference.

Closed-form expressions for link performance, in terms of detection error rate, ergodic capacity and outage capacity, under both frequency-selective RX I/Q imbalance and noisy frequency-selective fading channel are obtained as functions of image rejection ratios (IRRs) of the receiver front-end, average channel power delay profile as well as received SNR. The analysis results are then verified using extensive computer simulations. In general, the analysis shows that the performance of OFDM radio link under RX I/Q imbalance not only depends on the property of impairment itself but also depends on the correlation property of transmission channel. In this context, the proposed analysis provides fundamental understanding and very efficient tools for both circuit and system designers to accurately evaluate the I/Q imbalance effects in the OFDM radio link.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990406","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990406.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","startPage":"251","endPage":"255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical performance of OFDM radio link under RX I/Q imbalance and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical performance of OFDM radio link under RX I/Q imbalance and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990406/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182777","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990406/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical performance of OFDM radio link under RX I/Q imbalance and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p251zou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067675S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990407,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Carvajal","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Carvajal","id":"37953839800"},{"name":"Juan C.

Our simulation shows about 3-dB power saving of our scheme over an OFDMA system without network coding.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990408.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"265","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for downlink two-user OFDMA systems with wireless network coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Network coding","Search methods","Signal to noise ratio","Minimization","Encoding","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","network coding","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum-rate maximization problem","sum-power constraint","virtual user","Lagrange dual method","sum-power minimization","exhaustive search method","OFDMA","wireless network coding","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for downlink two-user OFDMA systems with wireless network coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990408/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182778","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for downlink two-user OFDMA systems with wireless network coding","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p261tarasak.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048198S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990409,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Aggarwal","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"37402867800"},{"name":"Mohamad Assaad","affiliation":["Department of Telecom, Supelec, France"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Assaad","id":"37269223500"},{"name":"C.

In particular, we consider sum-utility maximization over user schedules, powers, and code rates, subject to an instantaneous sum-power constraint. We consider both a \u201ccontinuous\u201d scenario where, during a time-slot, each OFDMA subchannel can be time-shared among multiple users and/or code rates, and a \u201cdiscrete\u201d scenario where no time-sharing is allowed. For the non-convex optimization problem arising in the continuous case, we propose an efficient exact solution. For the mixed-integer optimization problem arising in the discrete case, we propose a polynomial-complexity approximate solution and derive a bound on its optimality gap. We also provide a numerical study of goodput maximization for the SNR distribution that results from the use of pilot-aided MMSE channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990409","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990409.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal resource allocation in OFDMA downlink systems with imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990409/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal resource allocation in OFDMA downlink systems with imperfect CSI","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190620","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990409/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal resource allocation in OFDMA downlink systems with imperfect CSI","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p266aggarwal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071289S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5990410,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Pfletschinger","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Pfletschinger","id":"37269401100"},{"name":"David Declercq","affiliation":["ETIS, ENSEA, CNRS, University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Declercq","id":"37269103100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990410","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Encoding","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","diversity reception","parity check codes","space-time codes","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary coding","vector channel","q-ary LDPC code","multiple antenna transmission scheme","code symbol","transmit signal","multidimensional mapping","space-time diversity scheme","channel coding scheme"]}],"abstract":"We consider the application of non-binary coding schemes to vector channels, in particular we apply q-ary LDPC codes to multiple-antenna transmission schemes.

One algorithm operates in the time domain (TD), while the other one operates in the frequency domain (FD). The interference from the unknown data symbols is much smaller in the FD than in the TD, especially for small FOs. As a result, the FD initialization algorithm results in a lower mean squared error (MSE).

When the water-filling strategy is employed, different rates are allocated to subcarriers. However, a large signalling overhead is induced, when the employed allocation scheme must be sent to receivers via signalling. In this paper, to enhance energy efficiency, we propose that a dynamic and symmetric rate is allocated to subcarriers of each user. Thereby, fewer bits are required to express each allocation scheme. The asymptotic limit of induced performance loss is given compared to the water-filling strategy. Furthermore, the proposed strategy brings convenience for heuristic design. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher energy efficiency than the water-filling strategy as allocation schemes are frequently updated in fast time-varying environments.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990412","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990412.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","startPage":"276","endPage":"280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency on real time transmission in multiuser OFDM downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency on real time transmission in multiuser OFDM downlink","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990412/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190623","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990412/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency on real time transmission in multiuser OFDM downlink","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p276liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050437S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5990414,"authors":[{"name":"Jiun-Hung Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiun-Hung Wang","id":"37965165500"},{"name":"Yuan-Bin Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuan-Bin Lin","id":"37279540700"},{"name":"Yu T.

Using a tight capacity lower bound (CLB) as the performance metric, we derive the optimal source and relay power allocation ratio that maximizes the CLB of a cascaded source-relay-destination link. Based on this power ratio, we propose a simple suboptimal algorithm that assigns power, subcarriers and cooperative relays to each mobile station.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted as the modulation scheme to resolve the synchronization problem in PLNC and doubly selective channels with intercarrier interference (ICI) are considered. The critical process in such a system is the calculation of the network-coded transmit codeword at the relay on basis of the superimposed channel-coded signals of the two terminals. Different from existing works on non-iterative receiver design, we here consider iterative receiver design. We propose two turbo equalization receivers, one is the conventional iterative separate detection and decoding (I-SDD), and the other one is based on a recently developed estimation scheme for PLNC. Gaussian message passing (GMP) and sum-product algorithm (SPA) are used for ICI-aware equalization and channel decoding respectively. We find through numerical simulations that the performance of the I-SDD receiver can catch up with that of the state-of-the-art PLNC-based receiver when more than one receive antennas are used. One promising feature about the ISDD receiver is that the channel decoding complexity is much lower than that of the PLNC-based receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990415/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990415/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182780","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Turbo equalization for OFDM modulated physical layer network coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo equalization for OFDM modulated physical layer network coding","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p291huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098444S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5990416,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Bafna","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Bafna","id":"37946281900"},{"name":"Paolo Banelli","affiliation":["DIEI, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Banelli","id":"37271755900"},{"name":"Luca Rugini","affiliation":["DIEI, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Rugini","id":"37271756800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990416","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Optimization","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-stage centralized spectrum sensing","OFDM signal","cognitive radio","fusion center","distributed energy detectors","probability","false alarm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autocorrelation","cognitive radio","cooperative detection","energy detector","OFDM","spectrum sensing","voting rule"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990416","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990416","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","abstract":"We propose a three-stage centralized spectrum sensing for cognitive radios in OFDM systems, where local decisions of cooperative sensors are combined at the fusion center.

Furthermore, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM systems employing transmit diversity techniques, such as space-time (ST) and space-frequency (SF) coding, increase robustness and reliability over wireless fading channels. However, time-variation of the channel due to mobility disrupts orthogonality among subcarriers and yields intercarrier interference (ICI), limiting the performance of OFDM. In this paper we first recall a reduced-complexity technique to mitigate ICI in single-input-single-output (SISO) OFDM systems denoted per sub-block equalization (PSE) which operates on sub-blocks of the received OFDM symbol. Next we propose an extension of PSE to MIMO SF-OFDM systems. In particular, the Alamouti scheme is used in conjunction with PSE to combat ICI. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated for mobile digital video broadcasting DVB-T2 2 \u00d7 1 and 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO scenarios that suit with a possible extension to handheld devices in a next generation DVB-H. Numerical results show that the new receiver provides a gain from 21% to 33% with respect to the conventional OFDM receiver in terms of vehicular speed at which a target bit error rate can be maintained.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990418","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","startPage":"306","endPage":"310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency domain pre-equalizer for MIMO-OFDM mobile communication systems employing alamouti coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A frequency domain pre-equalizer for MIMO-OFDM mobile communication systems employing alamouti coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990418/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190626","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990418/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency domain pre-equalizer for MIMO-OFDM mobile communication systems employing alamouti coding","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p306baracca.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046995S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5990419,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Schwarz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schwarz","id":"37946483300"},{"name":"Michal \u0160imko","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"\u0160imko","id":"37704291600"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990419","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Channel capacity","Modulation","MIMO","Receivers","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO OFDM","wireless communication system","long term evolution system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance bounds","LTE","OFDMA","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop several increasingly tight and restrictive performance bounds for OFDM based MIMO wireless communication systems.

Unlike to previous methods, which suffer from ambiguities, for example, in the case of rotatable OSTBCs, our weighted covariance approach allows to resolve all non-scalar ambiguities provided that a specific transmitted symbol exhibits a higher power than the remaining symbols.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990422","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990422.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-form blind channel estimation in orthogonally coded MIMO-OFDM systems: A simple strategy to resolve non-scalar ambiguities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990422/","displayDocTitle":"Closed-form blind channel estimation in orthogonally coded MIMO-OFDM systems: A simple strategy to resolve non-scalar ambiguities","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182785","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990422/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-form blind channel estimation in orthogonally coded MIMO-OFDM systems: A simple strategy to resolve non-scalar ambiguities","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p321sarmadi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083469S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990423,"authors":[{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group-Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou","id":"38276004600"},{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group-Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990423","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"abstract":"This paper considers novel receiver structures for linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems, making special emphasis on soft detection principles.

The proposed algorithm is based on Null Space Zero-Forcing or Null Space Zero-Forcing with Greedy Stream Selection. The idea is to construct the precoder in a recursive stream-wise manner. The design proceeds in two steps. The first step is a recursive selection of the best streams, under a zero-forcing (ZF) constraint. The selection is based on an extension of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization for the MIMO channel case, involving SVDs (geared towards per stream DPC). The streams associated to the strongest singular values get selected. In a second step, the precoder for the selected streams are calculated according to one among several possible precoding techniques with eventually a power distribution optimization. The proposed algorithm is then compared to the best algorithms in the literature namely the ZFBF-SUS and to it's DPC version ZFDPC-SUS.

A general feedback framework based on the quantization of each user's channel Gram matrix is presented. Once the channel Gram matrices are available at the transmitter, they can be used to compute equivalent triangular MIMO channels for which the optimum precoder is calculated. As an application of this framework, a robust precoder design that takes into account errors in the CSI that are originated, for example, from the finite-bit quantization process applied in the feedback, is also presented. Finally the benefits of the proposed robust strategy are evaluated by means of numerical simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990426.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"345","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust linear precoding for MSE minimization in MIMO broadcast systems with channel Gram matrix feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Helium","Receivers","MIMO","Transmitters","Robustness","Downlink","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust linear precoding","MSE minimization","channel gram matrix feedback","multiple-input multiple-output multiuser broadcast channel","channel state information","linear precoding","channel Gram matrix","MIMO channel","finite-bit quantization process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","broadcast channels","matrix decomposition","robust designs","feedback communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust linear precoding for MSE minimization in MIMO broadcast systems with channel Gram matrix feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990426/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182788","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust linear precoding for MSE minimization in MIMO broadcast systems with channel Gram matrix feedback","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p341sacristanmurga.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.160069S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5990427,"authors":[{"name":"Eckhard Ohlmer","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Eckhard","lastName":"Ohlmer","id":"37408490200"},{"name":"Udo Wachsmann","affiliation":["ST-Ericsson AT GmbH, Nurnberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Udo","lastName":"Wachsmann","id":"37346942300"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990427","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":159},"abstract":"In this paper mutual information maximizing linear precoding for MIMO transmission using finite signal alphabets and a parallel layer MIMO detection scheme is derived.

The problem with this approach is that the DMT provides only a coarse measure of performance and, hence, it is more convenient to adopt the diversity, multiplexing, and array gain (DMA) framework, in which the error probability is characterized by two parameters: the diversity gain (associated with the SNR exponent) and the array gain (related to the SNR offset). In this paper, we derive the DMA tradeoff associated with the cut-set bound outage probability of the static half-duplex MIMO relay under uncorrelated/semicorrelated Rayleigh fading and uncorrelated Rician fading. This provides an upper bound to the DMA tradeoff achievable by any relaying scheme.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990430","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990430.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","startPage":"361","endPage":"365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DMA tradeoff for the MIMO static half-duplex relay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DMA tradeoff for the MIMO static half-duplex relay","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990430/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182792","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DMA tradeoff for the MIMO static half-duplex relay","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p361ordonez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055112S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5990431,"authors":[{"name":"Simon J\u00e4rmyr","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Signal Processing Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"J\u00e4rmyr","id":"37547209700"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Ottersten","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Signal Processing Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"},{"name":"Eduard Jorswieck","affiliation":["Communication Theory, Communications Laboratory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Jorswieck","id":"37275005700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990431","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990431","abstract":"We explore a novel approach to perform decoding-order optimization in the vertical Bell Labs layered space-time (V-BLAST) architecture. Allowing for simultaneous transmission of multiple, separately encoded data streams, the V-BLAST transmit-receive scheme applies to the uplink of a multi-user communication system. A multi-antenna receiver decodes data streams successively, dealing with inter-stream interference by means of cancelling and nulling; interference from previously decoded streams is cancelled by subtraction, and remaining interference is nulled by linear equalization. The order in which the streams are decoded can have a noticeable impact on system performance. We consider the optimization of a fixed decoding order in fast Rayleigh fading, based on long-term channel-fading parameters. For a wide range of performance measures, we show that the fast-fading ordering problem can be treated as a classical linear assignment problem, allowing a solution using existing, efficient algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","startPage":"366","endPage":"370","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990431.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal V-BLAST ordering in fast Rayleigh fading: A linear assignment problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels","Cost function","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","interference suppression","optimisation","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal V-BLAST ordering","fast rayleigh fading","linear assignment problem","decoding-order optimization","vertical Bell Labs layered space-time architecture","encoded data stream","V-BLAST transmit-receive scheme","multiantenna receiver","data streams decode","inter-stream interference","linear equalization","long-term channel-fading parameter","performance measurement","fast-fading ordering problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication systems","V-BLAST","ZF","successive interference cancellation","decision feedback equalizers","fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal V-BLAST ordering in fast Rayleigh fading: A linear assignment problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990431/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990431/","accessionNumber":"12182793","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal V-BLAST ordering in fast Rayleigh fading: A linear assignment problem","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p366jarmyr.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13191S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5990433,"authors":[{"name":"Bruhtesfa Godana","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Bruhtesfa","lastName":"Godana","id":"37590801700"},{"name":"Torbj\u00f6rn Ekman","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Torbj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ekman","id":"37318026000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990433","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"abstract":"MIMO systems require eigenmode information at the transmitter to exploit the multiplexing gain of the channel. In practice, the eigenmode information available at the transmitter after feedback is noisy and outdated. One of the efficient feedback methods used in MIMO systems involves the decomposition of unitary matrices into Givens rotations. This entails the possibility to update the eigenmodes by predicting the Givens rotations. In this paper, two MIMO precoder prediction schemes based on channel prediction at the mobile station (MS) and Givens parameters prediction at the base station (BS) are proposed. The system capacity of the two schemes is evaluated and compared by using a simulation on a time-varying MIMO channel. Simulations show that both prediction schemes improve the system performance; however, channel prediction at the MS has better performance than Givens prediction at the BS. Despite a lower performance, Givens prediction at the BS reduces the number of parameters to be tracked and is suitable for variable delay systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990433.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"375","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear prediction of time-varying MIMO systems using Givens rotations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","Matrix decomposition","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear prediction","time-varying MIMO systems","Givens rotation","multiplexing gain","eigenmode","mobile station","MS","channel prediction","unitary matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","eigenvector prediction","Givens rotations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Linear prediction of time-varying MIMO systems using Givens rotations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990433/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190629","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear prediction of time-varying MIMO systems using Givens rotations","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p371godana.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047299S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5990434,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael F.

In such a scenario, the presence of channel state information (CSI) at the BS is essential for efficient system performance. In reciprocal TDD systems, CSI can be obtained via uplink training. Since only finite time-frequency resources are available, such uplink training generally must be performed using non-orthogonal resources (for different users), leading to pilot contamination between users who train simultaneously. In particular, we analyze the rate of convergence of SINR (in presence of pilot contamination) as the number of antennas (M) at the BS increases to an infinite limit. The effect of SNR and the fading coefficients of the user channels on this rate of convergence is also determined.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990435","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990435.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","startPage":"381","endPage":"385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of pilot contamination on multi-user MIMO cellular systems with many antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of pilot contamination on multi-user MIMO cellular systems with many antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990435/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190630","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990435/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of pilot contamination on multi-user MIMO cellular systems with many antennas","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p381gopalakrishnan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044058S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990436,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Jung Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Jung Huang","id":"37859762900"},{"name":"Chih-Yung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Yung Wu","id":"37959864400"},{"name":"Ta-Sung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ta-Sung Lee","id":"37277273300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990436","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Slabs","MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis","Receiving antennas","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","geometry","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry based efficient decoding algorithm","underdetermined MIMO system","slab decoding algorithm","dynamic radius adaptation","near-ML decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["maximum-likelihood (ML) detection","sphere decoding","underdetermined MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel decoder for underdetermined MIMO systems with low decoding complexity is proposed.

The presented expressions allow to easily study the impact of channel estimation errors and fading correlation on the performance of rate-adaptive MIMO OSTBC systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990440.pdf","endPage":"410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-adaptive modulation for square OSTBCs in arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading with imperfect channel estimation","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990440","startPage":"406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rate-adaptive modulation for square OSTBCs in arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading with imperfect channel estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990440/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12190632","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990440/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-adaptive modulation for square OSTBCs in arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading with imperfect channel estimation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p406jacobs.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076373S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5990441,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Wagner","affiliation":["EURECOM, ST-Ericsson, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37534218200"},{"name":"Dirk T.

In a dual-hop network consisting of multiple relays, one of the most challenging tasks is to determine an appropriate trade-off point between the end-to-end block-error rate (BLER) and an additional delay caused due to HARQ retransmissions in two hops. The retransmissions can either be initiated at the relay nodes or at the source node. HARQ protocol for such a network, should therefore be capable of dynamically deciding the node-of-retransmission. The SHARQ schemes proposed here are designed intelligent in a way that they take into account the presence of two relays and the benefit of using cooperative schemes. Basically the system developed here, intends to provide the combined benefits of diversity gain from cooperative schemes and the throughput improvement from SHARQ in a best possible way. This paper explicitly compares the most basic case of single relay system without HARQ and cooperation with the most advanced scenarios of cooperative communication with SHARQ schemes. It is observed that the latter of the two above scenarios results in throughput improvement of almost 4dB in terms of SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990443.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Hybrid-ARQ (SHARQ) for cooperative communication via distributed relays in LTE-advanced","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Delay","Throughput","MIMO","Wireless communication","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cooperative communication","diversity reception","error statistics","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart hybrid ARQ","cooperative communication","distributed relays","LTE-advanced","automatic repeat request","incremental redundancy","dual hop network","end-to-end block error rate","HARQ retransmissions","HARQ protocol","diversity gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3GPP","Cooperative Communication","Decode and Forward","Delay Diversity Scheme","Distributed Alamouti Scheme","Hybrid-ARQ","LTE-Advanced","Macro-diversity","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Smart Hybrid-ARQ (SHARQ) for cooperative communication via distributed relays in LTE-advanced","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990443/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182800","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Hybrid-ARQ (SHARQ) for cooperative communication via distributed relays in LTE-advanced","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p41bhamri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057908S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990444,"authors":[{"name":"Samir-Mohamad Omar","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Samir-Mohamad","lastName":"Omar","id":"37410970900"},{"name":"Dirk T.

This feature leads semi-blind channel estimation performance to exceed that of the schemes based on the blind part or the training sequence only. Moreover, in some situations they can estimate the channel when the other techniques fail. Semi-blind channel estimation techniques were developed and usually evaluated for a given channel realization, i.e. with a deterministic channel model. On the other hand, in wireless communications the channel is typically modeled as Rayleigh fading, i.e. with a Gaussian (prior) distribution expressing variances of and correlations between channel coefficients. In recent years, such prior information on the channel has started to get exploited in pilot-based channel estimation, since often the pure pilot-based (deterministic) channel estimate is of limited quality due to limited pilots. In this paper we explore a Bayesian approach to semi-blind channel estimation, exploiting a priori information on fading channels. We mainly focus on semi-blind joint ML/MAP estimation of channels and symbols on one hand, and on semi-blind ML/MAP estimation of channels with elimination of symbols on the other hand. As a consequence, a unified framework along with three novel semi-blind Bayesian estimators are introduced whose performance is compared by simulations to three, one extended and another two already existing semi-blind non-Bayesian estimators.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","startPage":"421","endPage":"425","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990444.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian semi-blind FIR channel estimation algorithms in SIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Gold","Bayesian methods","Cost function","Signal to noise ratio","Probability density function","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","channel estimation","Gaussian distribution","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian semi-blind FIR channel estimation algorithm","SIMO system","training sequence","channel realization","wireless communication","Rayleigh fading","Gaussian distribution","channel coefficient","MAP estimation","semi-blind Bayesian estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian semi-blind FIR channel estimation algorithms in SIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990444/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990444/","accessionNumber":"12182801","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian semi-blind FIR channel estimation algorithms in SIMO systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p421omar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059273S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990445,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Bornhorst","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Bornhorst","id":"37704465200"},{"name":"Marius Pesavento","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Pesavento","id":"37285062000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990445","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Array signal processing","Quality of service","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Iterative methods","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","array signal processing","computational complexity","convex programming","iterative methods","quality of service","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative convex approximation approach","transmit beamforming","multiple cochannel multicast multigroup","transmitted antenna array","power transmitted","quality-of-service constraint","QoS constraint","NP-hard problem","second-order cone programming problem","SOCP problem","semidefinite relaxation method","SDR method","power scaling","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicasting","broadcasting","downlink beamforming","convex optimization","second-order cone programming"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel algorithm for transmit beamforming to multiple cochannel multicast groups.

These approaches are suitable for flat-fading channels in white noise with equal noise variances across antennas; knowledge of the noise variance is not required, unlike the energy detector. In this paper we investigate a method based on analysis of the multivariate power spectral density (PSD) of the received multiantenna signal. Our proposed approach is also based on GLRT and flat-fading channels, but it allows the noise variances to be different at different antennas without requiring knowledge of their values. A performance analysis of the proposed detector is carried out. Simulation examples are provided in support of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12182803","htmlLink":"/document/5990446/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple antenna spectrum sensing for cognitive radios in unknown noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple antenna spectrum sensing for cognitive radios in unknown noise","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p431tugnait.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053695S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5990450,"authors":[{"name":"Eduard A.

The legacy rate constraint is transformed into an interference constraint profile with individual interference temperature constraints (ITC) for the cognitive users. By spatial shaping (transmit covariance matrix optimization, linear precoding), an iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the sum capacity of the cognitive MIMO MAC system, in which each user updates its transmit strategy with the transmit strategies of the other users fixed. The optimal single-user transmit strategy is obtained by comparing the achievable rate of two iterative algorithms, where transmit covariance matrix with either rank-one or rank-larger-than-one is optimized.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990450","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990450.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial shaping in cognitive MIMO MAC with coded legacy transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990450/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial shaping in cognitive MIMO MAC with coded legacy transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182804","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990450/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial shaping in cognitive MIMO MAC with coded legacy transmission","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p451jorswieck.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081539S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5990452,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Firouzabadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Firouzabadi","id":"37393290000"},{"name":"Andrea Goldsmith","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37269021300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990452","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":544},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Optimization","Interference","Fading","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cellular radio","radio networks","stochastic processes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal placement","cellular systems","distributed antenna systems","optimization framework","stochastic approximation theory","wireless network","shadowing model"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the optimal placement of transmit antennas in distributed antenna systems.

However this detection strategy is based on the exploitation of the structure of interference which necessitates the knowledge of the constellation and precoder of the co-scheduled user equipment (UE). As the downlink control information (DCI) in LTE is devoid of this information, we look in this paper at the sensitivity of LTE's multi-user MIMO mode to the information of co-scheduled UE. We show that exploiting the discrete nature of interference in the absence of the exact knowledge of interference constellation has significant gains as compared to the suboptimal single-user detection. To this end, we propose a blind receiver for LTE which shows significantly improved performance as compared to single-user receivers and exhibits a minor degradation as compared to interference aware receivers.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990462","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990462.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference sensitivity for multiuser MIMO in LTE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990462/","displayDocTitle":"Interference sensitivity for multiuser MIMO in LTE","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182810","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990462/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference sensitivity for multiuser MIMO in LTE","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p506ghaffar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045675S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990468,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"lastName":"Fan Sun","id":"37087453169"},{"name":"Elisabeth de Carvalho","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Elisabeth","lastName":"de Carvalho","id":"37293743600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990468","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990468","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Nickel","Interference","Network coding","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetrical multiway relay networks","base station conveys independent symbols","DOF","transmitter","joint multiple access","broadcast precoding design","signal space alignment concept","antennas"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an asymmetrical multi-way relay channel where a base station conveys independent symbols to K different users while receiving independent symbols from the users.

This channel model is motivated by the recent interest in cooperative small-cell systems where several densely deployed base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve multiple user terminals (UTs). We study the fluctuations of the mutual information of this channel under the form of a central limit theorem (CLT) and provide an explicit expression of the asymptotic variance. The result can be used to compute an approximation of the outage probability of such channels. Although the derived expressions are only tight in the large system limit, we show by simulations that they provide very accurate approximations for realistic system dimensions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990472.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"555","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage performance of cooperative small-cell systems under Rician fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Approximation methods","Rician channels","Signal to noise ratio","Random variables","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","probability","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage performance","cooperative small-cell systems","Rician fading channels","MIMO","multiple-input multiple-output channels","noncentered channel matrix","base stations","BS","multiple user terminals","UT","central limit theorem","CLT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Outage performance of cooperative small-cell systems under Rician fading channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990472/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190646","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage performance of cooperative small-cell systems under Rician fading channels","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p551hoydis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049534S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990478,"authors":[{"name":"Fred Harris","affiliation":["San Diego State University, USA"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Harris","id":"37277456200"},{"name":"Xiaofei Chen","affiliation":["San Diego State University, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaofei Chen","id":"37596821300"},{"name":"Elettra Venosa","affiliation":["San Diego State University, USA"],"firstName":"Elettra","lastName":"Venosa","id":"37591250900"},{"name":"Francesco A.N.

This paper provides a semi-blind solution, for both timing and gain mismatches correction, in the digital data section of a two-channel TI-ADC for band-pass input signals.

Given that the optimal allocation of the total sensing time to multiple channels depends on the unknown parameters, a sequential estimation strategy is proposed which operates under an epoch structure with exponentially growing epoch length. It is shown that this sequential estimation strategy is asymptotically efficient as the total sensing time increases. This result finds application in opportunistic spectrum access where secondary users need to estimate the channel occupancy model of the primary system for efficient exploitation of spectrum opportunities.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990480.pdf","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotically efficient multi-channel estimation for opportunistic spectrum access","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990480","startPage":"66","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotically efficient multi-channel estimation for opportunistic spectrum access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990480/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12182821","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990480/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotically efficient multi-channel estimation for opportunistic spectrum access","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p66tehrani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062917S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990482,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Maleki","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Maleki","id":"38556743500"},{"name":"Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sundeep Prabhakar","lastName":"Chepuri","id":"37946356800"},{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9332-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9333-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9331-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1948-3244"}],"articleNumber":"5990482","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":734},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990482","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Throughput","Sensors","Optimization","Energy consumption","Search problems","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","demodulation","energy conservation","optimisation","probability","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput efficient strategy","energy efficient strategy","efficient cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","detection performance","efficient throughput optimization setup","fusion rule","detection probability","false alarm","throughput maximization","optimal reporting time","sensing time frame","line search problem","AND rule","OR rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radios","Cooperative spectrum sensing","Energy efficiency","Hard decision fusion","Scheduling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990482","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977169/5989975/05990482.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2011.5990482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy and throughput efficient strategies for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","abstract":"An efficient cooperative spectrum sensing based cognitive radio network employs a certain number of secondary users to sense the spectrum while satisfying a constraint on the detection performance. We derive the optimal number of cognitive radios under two scenarios: an energy efficient and a throughput optimization setup. In the energy efficient setup, the number of cooperating cognitive radios is minimized for a k-out-of-N fusion rule with a constraint on the probability of detection and false alarm while in the throughput optimization setup, we maximize the throughput of the cognitive radio network, by deriving the optimal reporting time in a sensing time frame which is proportional to the number of cognitive users, subject to a constraint on the probability of detection. It is shown that both problems can be simplified to line search problems. The simulation results show that the OR and the majority rule outperform the AND rule in terms of energy efficiency and that the OR rule gives a higher throughput than the AND rule with a smaller number of users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990482/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12182822","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990482/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy and throughput efficient strategies for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy and throughput efficient strategies for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radios","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p71maleki.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060809S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5990483,"authors":[{"name":"Nurul H.

The channel state information is partial such that each transmitter knows its channel to the PRx but has no information about its channel to the CRx. This contribution proposes two simple transmission strategies focusing the CR channels in the so-called \u201coverlay paradigm\u201d where the CTx not only transmits its own message but helps as well transmitting the primary message. In the first strategy, the primary message is independently encoded at the two transmitters whereas the same primary message encoding is used in the second strategy which not only allows the coherent signal combining at the PRx but also the possibility of complete interference cancellation at the CRx even in the limiting case when the CRx is equipped only with two antennas. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy with same primary message encoding shows considerable performance benefit over the strategy where the primary message is independently encoded at the two transmitters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990484/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12190651","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990484/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rate regions for cognitive radio Gaussian fading channels with partial CSIT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rate regions for cognitive radio Gaussian fading channels with partial CSIT","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p81salim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050323S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977169","isNumber":"5989975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977169","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5989975","articleId":"5990484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5990485,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"lastName":"Lei Jiao","id":"37401908300"},{"name":"Meisam Razaviyayn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Meisam","lastName":"Razaviyayn","id":"37712721300"},{"name":"Enbin Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Enbin","lastName":"Song","id":"37289093800"},{"name":"Zhi-Quan Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi-Quan Luo","id":"37279736200"},{"name":"Frank Y.

Because of its promising benefits, every day more and more enterprises are relying on Cloud systems. Furthermore, new Cloud business models are appearing, most of them within the SaaS marketplace, which fully depend on PaaS and IaaS providers. In any case, the expectation from businesses that IT (Cloud) services and infrastructures should bring them closer to the achievement of their Business-Level Objectives (BLOs) is spreading. Due to this fact, the presence in Cloud providers of a self-management of Cloud services and infrastructures driven by business-level aspects is mandatory. In this direction, the Business-Driven IT Management (BDIM) discipline has been evolving as the most promising way in the sense of aligning IT (low-level) management decisions with business-level objectives coming from providers themselves, as well as from their users. In this paper, we expose several BDIM challenges on the Cloud computing paradigm. Consequently, we outline key issues for the inclusion of BDIM-related features into the core operation of Cloud providers.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2011.5990507","publicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976317/5990489/05990507.pdf","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2011.5990507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Initial thoughts on business-driven IT management challenges in Cloud computing providers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990507/","displayDocTitle":"Initial thoughts on business-driven IT management challenges in Cloud computing providers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12190410","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990507/","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Initial thoughts on business-driven IT management challenges in Cloud computing providers","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"BDIM4d80858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043518S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976317","isNumber":"5990489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976317","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5990489","articleId":"5990507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5990515,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The integration scheme provides the bandwidth advantages of the optical networks and mobility features of the wireless networks for Subscriber Stations (SSs). It also brings economic efficiency to the network providers particularly in rural area where the existing wired telecommunication infrastructures such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Cable Modem (CM), T-1/E-1 networks or fibre deployments are either costly or unreachable. For successful integration of the optical and wireless technologies there are some technical issues which need to be addressed efficiently in order to provide End-to-End (ETE) and diverse Quality of Service (QoS) for various service classes. This paper investigates the possible challenging issues for the integrated structure of the Time Division Multiplexing and Wavelength Division Multiplexing Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (TDM EPON and WDM EPON ) with the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access and Wireless Fidelity (WiMAX and Wi-Fi) networks. To reduce the ETE delay and provide the QoS for diverse service classes, we have compared six existing upstream scheduling mechanisms in two levels which are distributed on Access Points (APs) from Wi-Fi domain and Base Stations (BSs) from WiMAX domain. Performance evaluations of the existing scheduling techniques for three popular service classes (Quad-play) have been studied which show the strong impact of using the efficient up-link scheduler in converged scenario. We have also proposed a dynamic scheduling algorithm for optical and wireless integration scheme, which is under the implementation and evaluation process.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2011.5990515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990489","publicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976317/5990489/05990515.pdf","endPage":"1020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid optical and wireless technology integrations for next generation broadband access networks","doi":"10.1109/INM.2011.5990515","startPage":"1013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid optical and wireless technology integrations for next generation broadband access networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990515/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12190418","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990515/","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid optical and wireless technology integrations for next generation broadband access networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"BcN2b80767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096303S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976317","isNumber":"5990489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976317","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5990489","articleId":"5990515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5990536,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Reidemeister","affiliation":["Shoshin Distributed Systems Group, E&CE Department, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Reidemeister","id":"37424133500"},{"name":"Miao Jiang","affiliation":["Shoshin Distributed Systems Group, E&CE Department, University of Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Miao Jiang","id":"37650032100"},{"name":"Paul A.S.

Avoiding system downtime and loss of revenue dictates a fast and efficient root-cause analysis process. Operator practice and academic research have shown that about 80% of failures in such systems have recurrent causes; therefore, significant efficiency gains can be achieved by automating their identification. In this paper, we present a novel approach to modelling features of log files. This model offers a compact representation of log data that can be efficiently extracted from large amounts of monitoring data. We also use decision-tree classifiers to learn and classify symptoms of recurrent faults. This representation enables automated fault matching and, in addition, enables human investigators to understand manifestations of failure easily. Our model does not require any access to application source code, a specification of log messages, or deep application knowledge. We evaluate our proposal using fault-injection experiments against other proposals in the field. First, we show that the features needed for symptom definition can be extracted more efficiently than does related work. Second, we show that these features enable an accurate classification of recurrent faults using only standard machine learning techniques. This enables us to identify accurately up to 78% of the faults in our evaluation data set.","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976317/5990489/05990536.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","doi":"10.1109/INM.2011.5990536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2011.5990536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mining unstructured log files for recurrent fault diagnosis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Manuals","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","data mining","data structures","decision trees","fault diagnosis","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unstructured log file mining","recurrent fault diagnosis","enterprise software systems","automated root-cause analysis","revenue loss","decision-tree classifiers","automated fault matching","fault-injection experiments","machine learning techniques","log data representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mining unstructured log files for recurrent fault diagnosis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990536/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12190437","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining unstructured log files for recurrent fault diagnosis","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"MC1a77655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077304S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976317","isNumber":"5990489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976317","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5990489","articleId":"5990536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5990537,"authors":[{"name":"Chengwei Wang","affiliation":["CERCS, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Chengwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37964386400"},{"name":"Krishnamurthy Viswanathan","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Company, USA","CERCS, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnamurthy","lastName":"Viswanathan","id":"37275297700"},{"name":"Lakshminarayan Choudur","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Company, USA","CERCS, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Lakshminarayan","lastName":"Choudur","id":"37945196200"},{"name":"Vanish Talwar","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Company, USA","CERCS, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Vanish","lastName":"Talwar","id":"37284776200"},{"name":"Wade Satterfield","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Company, USA","CERCS, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Wade","lastName":"Satterfield","id":"37945195700"},{"name":"Karsten Schwan","affiliation":["CERCS, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Schwan","id":"37268091800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9221-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9219-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9220-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5990537","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","Gaussian processes","Internet","security of data","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical technique","online anomaly detection","data center management","light weight technique","management action","relative entropy statistics","production environment","multitier Web application","server class machine","standard Gaussian assumption"]}],"abstract":"Online anomaly detection is an important step in data center management, requiring light-weight techniques that provide sufficient accuracy for subsequent diagnosis and management actions.

The collection and analysis of the log messages from the network devices (i.e., router and switch) are a common method. However, the detection of the anomalous events is painful because of a huge amount and many types of log messages; the important event messages are sometimes hidden in a large number of relatively less important and usual event messages. Many researches have been devoted to find out anomalies accurately and quickly by using time series of log message. To construct the log time series for anomaly detection in order to highlight such hidden anomalies, this paper focuses on the effectiveness of using a global weight that is based on a global appearance of a message type in the all data set. We introduce two types of the global weight called residual inverse document frequency (RIDF) and entropy that are well-known method in information retrieval field. Then, we evaluate the performance improvement due to the global weights with a wavelet-based abrupt change detection algorithm through 1-year long collection of core router log messages taken from a Japanese R&E network. Our main findings are (1) the global weights assign a low weight to less important and frequently appeared event messages, (2) they highlight unusual events by removing temporal correlation (i.e., periodic trend), and (3) the wavelet-based detection algorithm more accurately alarms the anomalous time period with the weighted time series.","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976317/5990489/05990538.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"398","publicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","doi":"10.1109/INM.2011.5990538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2011.5990538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of weighted syslog time series for anomaly detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manuals","Entropy","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document handling","natural languages","security of data","time series","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted syslog time series","anomaly detection","network operation","network devices","residual inverse document frequency","RIDF","wavelet-based abrupt change detection algorithm","core router log messages","Japanese R&E network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the use of weighted syslog time series for anomaly detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990538/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12190439","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of weighted syslog time series for anomaly detection","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"MC1c78408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065146S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976317","isNumber":"5990489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976317","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5990489","articleId":"5990538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5990550,"authors":[{"name":"Ricky K.

Owing to TCP's reliable service, the picture and sound quality would not be degraded by network impairments, such as high delay and packet loss. However, the network impairments can cause rebuffering events which would result in jerky playback and deform the video's temporal structure. These quality degradations could adversely affect users' quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we investigate the relationship among three levels of quality of service (QoS) of HTTP video streaming: network QoS, application QoS, and user QoS (i.e., QoE). Our ultimate goal is to understand how the network QoS affects the QoE of HTTP video streaming. Our approach is to first characterize the correlation between the application and network QoS using analytical models and empirical evaluation. The second step is to perform subjective experiments to evaluate the relationship between application QoS and QoE. Our analysis reveals that the frequency of rebuffering is the main factor responsible for the variations in the QoE.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring the quality of experience of HTTP video streaming","publicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","doi":"10.1109/INM.2011.5990550","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976317/5990489/05990550.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2011.5990550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Measuring the quality of experience of HTTP video streaming","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990550/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12190450","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring the quality of experience of HTTP video streaming","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"MC5b78416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051894S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976317","isNumber":"5990489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976317","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"5990489","articleId":"5990550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990552,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Olariu","affiliation":["Telecommunication Software and Systems Group Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Olariu","id":"37949511700"},{"name":"M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Foghl\u00fa","affiliation":["Telecommunication Software and Systems Group Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland"],"firstName":"M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3","lastName":"Foghl\u00fa","id":"37298879900"},{"name":"Philip Perry","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Informatics University College, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Perry","id":"37271941100"},{"name":"Liam Murphy","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Informatics University College, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Liam","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37268295300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9221-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9219-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9220-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5990552","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"abstract":"The increasing number of users demanding voice and data communication through cellular networks has driven the need for higher network throughput rates and lower latency. LTE femtocells address this pressing problem by offloading cellular service providers networks and increase both coverage and capacity for their users. Assuming a wired DSL backhaul for these femtocells, this paper shows simulations exploring a case where the DSLAM represents the main bottleneck when the cellular network operator and the DSL provider do not collaborate. This paper introduces the concept of Intermediary Mean Opinion Score which may be employed at femtocell gateways to isolate network problems and feed into customer experience management. We also propose and investigate a technique of mapping the human audio recency into the MOS calculation. Results are presented to illustrate the information that can be extracted from a lightweight monitor in the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976317/5990489/05990552.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"508","publicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","doi":"10.1109/INM.2011.5990552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2011.5990552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VoIP quality monitoring in LTE femtocells","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Broadband communication","Delay","Informatics","Ear","Switches","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","digital subscriber lines","femtocellular radio","Internet telephony","internetworking","Long Term Evolution","monitoring","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VoIP quality monitoring","LTE femtocells","data communication","network throughput rates","cellular service provider networks","DSLAM","wired DSL backhaul","intermediary mean opinion score","femtocell gateways","MOS calculation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VoIP","MOS","femtocells","LTE","network management solution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"VoIP quality monitoring in LTE femtocells","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990552/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12190452","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VoIP quality monitoring in LTE femtocells","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"MC5d78422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060512S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976317","isNumber":"5990489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976317","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5990489","articleId":"5990552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990564,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407023100"},{"name":"Hui Zhang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Ya-Yunn Su","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Ya-Yunn","lastName":"Su","id":"37959889700"},{"name":"Xiaorui Wang","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaorui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281385700"},{"name":"Guofei Jiang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Princeton, NJ"],"firstName":"Guofei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37333652500"},{"name":"Kenji Yoshihira","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Princeton, NJ"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Yoshihira","id":"37586761300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9221-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9219-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9220-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"5990564","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":901},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Data structures","Logic gates","Multiplexing","Resource management","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","bin packing","computational complexity","computer centres","optimisation","Poisson distribution","stochastic processes","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtualized data center","server consolidation","approximation algorithm","stochastic bin packing problem","server overflow probability","VM sizing","stochastic optimization problem","VM dynamic load","VM resource demand","statistical multiplexing principle","polynomial time VM placement algorithms","VM migration cost","Poisson distribution","server consolidation solution"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we undertake the problem of server consolidation in virtualized data centers from the perspective of approximation algorithms. We formulate server consolidation as a stochastic bin packing problem, where the server capacity and an allowed server overflow probability p are given, and the objective is to assign VMs to as few physical servers as possible, and the probability that the aggregated load of a physical server exceeds the server capacity is at most p. We propose a new VM sizing approach called effective sizing, which simplifies the stochastic optimization problem by associating a VM's dynamic load with a fixed demand. Effective sizing decides a VM's resource demand through statistical multiplexing principles, which consider various factors impacting the aggregated resource demand of a host where the VM may be placed. Based on effective sizing, we design a suite of polynomial time VM placement algorithms for both VM migration cost-oblivious and migration cost-aware scenarios. Through analysis, we show that our algorithm is O(1)- approximation for the stochastic bin packing problem when the VM loads can be modeled as all Poisson or all normal distributions. Through evaluations driven by a real data center load trace, we show that our consolidation solution can achieve an order of reduction on physical server requirement compared to that before consolidation; the consolidation result is only 24% more than the optimal solution. With effective sizing, our server consolidation solution achieves 10% to 23% more energy savings than state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2011.5990564","publicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976317/5990489/05990564.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2011.5990564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective VM sizing in virtualized data centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990564/","displayDocTitle":"Effective VM sizing in virtualized data centers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12190464","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990564/","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective VM sizing in virtualized data centers","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"MC8d78415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067536S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976317","isNumber":"5990489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976317","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5990489","articleId":"5990564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990602,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshihiko Miyasato","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Analysis and Statistical, Inference, The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiko","lastName":"Miyasato","id":"37275167500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5990602","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990602","abstract":"Design methods of adaptive H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n formation control of multi-agent systems composed of Euler-Lagrange systems by utilizing neural network approximators are presented in this paper.

We propose a hierarchical modeling approach that can easily combine all components of this environment. Identifying interactions among the components is the key to construct such models. In this particular environment, we first construct four sub-models: an outbound bandwidth model, a cloud computing availability model, a latency model and a cloud computing response time model. Then we use a redirection strategy graph to glue them together. We also introduce an all-in-one barometer to ease the evaluation. The numeric results show that our model serves as a very useful analytical tool for online service providers to evaluate cloud computing providers and design redirection strategies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical model to evaluate quality of experience of online services hosted by cloud computing","publicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","doi":"10.1109/INM.2011.5990680","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976317/5990489/05990680.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2011.5990680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical model to evaluate quality of experience of online services hosted by cloud computing","conferenceDate":"23-27 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990680/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12190532","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical model to evaluate quality of experience of online services hosted by cloud computing","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"TS04e78311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074835S","chronDate":"23-27 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976317","isNumber":"5990489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976317","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5990489","articleId":"5990680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5990779,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel Garc\u00eda","affiliation":["Department of Mechanics and Mechatronics, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Zaragoza, Mexico"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Garc\u00eda","id":"37959949300"},{"name":"Daishi A.

The controller has a hybrid structure. Specifically, in the inner loop, a nonlinear control law is designed in continuous-time domain to have an arbitrarily good disturbance rejection performance at the steady-state while keeping the tracking errors with respect to on-line replanned trajectory within certain positive invariant set even in the presence of input saturation and bounded disturbances, provided that the replanned trajectory satisfies certain conditions. In the outer loop, a trajectory replanning unit implemented in discrete-time domain is constructed to generate a replanned trajectory satisfying those conditions while minimizing the converging time of the replanned trajectory to the desired target. It is theoretically shown that the resulting closed-loop system is globally stable and can track any feasible desired trajectory with a guaranteed steady-state tracking accuracy. Comparative simulation results have been obtained to verify the superior performance of the proposed controller over various existing ones in terms of the disturbance rejection capability and the overall respond speed of the resulting closed-loop system for a third-order integrator chain.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5990795","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05990795.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5990795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","startPage":"4434","endPage":"4439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Globally stable fast tracking control of a chain of integrators with input saturation and disturbances: A holistic approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Globally stable fast tracking control of a chain of integrators with input saturation and disturbances: A holistic approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990795/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12384054","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990795/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally stable fast tracking control of a chain of integrators with input saturation and disturbances: A holistic approach","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083752S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5990795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5990854,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Seuret","affiliation":["NeCS Team, Department of Automatic Control, UMR 5216, GIPSA-Lab-CNRS, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Seuret","id":"37298882600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5990854","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Stability criteria","Asymptotic stability","Actuators","Time varying systems","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","distributed parameter systems","linear matrix inequalities","networked control systems","sampled data systems","sampling methods","stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability analysis","networked control systems","asynchronous sampling","input delay","linear systems","sampled-data inputs","delayed inputs","control loop","transmission delays","delay-dependent conditions","linear matrix inequalities","stability criteria"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990854","abstract":"This article proposes a novel approach to assess stability of linear systems with delayed and sampled-data inputs.

The analysis results in an eigenvalue structure consisting of two stable subsidence modes and one unstable oscillatory mode. Analysis shows a modal structure consistent with the standard VTOL structure. The unstable oscillatory mode is close to the imaginary axis, consistent with the modal structure of hovering helicopters. Scaling properties are consistent with previous numerical results.

It is shown that the proposed algorithm constructs a bimodal switched Lyapunov function in a finite step if one exists.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5990873/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12314196","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Constructing a bimodal switched Lyapunov function for non-uniformly sampled-data feedback systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing a bimodal switched Lyapunov function for non-uniformly sampled-data feedback systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069882S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5990873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5990887,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Xu","affiliation":["Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536008700"},{"name":"Jongeun Choi","affiliation":["Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jongeun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405969800"},{"name":"Sarat Dass","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Probability, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sarat","lastName":"Dass","id":"37085460263"},{"name":"Taps Maiti","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Probability, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Taps","lastName":"Maiti","id":"37061433200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5990887","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"abstract":"In this paper, we formulate a full Bayesian approach for spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression under practical conditions such as measurement noise and unknown hyperparmeters (particularly, the bandwidths). Thus, multi factorial effects of observations, measurement noise and prior distributions of hyperparameters are all correctly incorporated in the computed predictive distribution. Using discrete prior probabilities and compactly supported kernels, we provide a way to design sequential Bayesian prediction algorithms that can be computed (without using the Gibbs sampler) in constant time as the number of observations increases. Both centralized and distributed sequential Bayesian prediction algorithms have been proposed for mobile sensor networks. An adaptive sampling strategy for mobile sensors, using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, has been proposed to minimize the prediction error variances.

Optimal algorithm parameters and associated convergence rates are derived for distributed resource allocation and consensus problems, and the practical performance of the accelerated gradient algorithms are shown to outperform alternatives in the literature. Since the optimal parameters for the accelerated gradient method depends on upper and lower bounds of the Hessian, we study how errors in these estimates influence the convergence rate of the algorithm. This analysis identifies, among other things, cases where erroneous estimates of the Hessian bounds cause the accelerated method to have slower convergence than the corresponding (non-accelerated) gradient method. An application to Internet congestion control illustrates these issues.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5990992","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05990992.pdf","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5990992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated gradient methods for networked optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5990992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5990992/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated gradient methods for networked optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12286666","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5990992/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated gradient methods for networked optimization","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065444S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5990992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5991014,"authors":[{"name":"Sourabh Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Lab, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Sourabh","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37275362500"},{"name":"Tamer Ba\u015far","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Lab, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Ba\u015far","id":"37269539100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5991014","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991014","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Equations","Sensors","Heuristic algorithms","Vectors","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","feedback","linear systems","regulation","signal reconstruction","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparsity based feedback design","opportunistic sensing","compressive sensing","dynamical system control","l1-regularization","sparse data reconstruction","erroneous state-estimation","feedback system design","sparsification scheme","stability","plant regulation","discrete-time linear system"]}],"abstract":"We introduce the concept of using compressive sensing techniques to provide feedback in order to control dynamical systems.

In order to mitigate the vibration, different approaches have been proposed, among which Tuned Mass Dampers (TMDs) are one of the most preferable and have been widely used in practice. Instead of dissipating the vibration energy into heat waste via the viscous damping element, this paper presents an approach to harvest the vibration energy from tall buildings with TMDs, by replacing the damping element with electromagnetic harvester. This paper demonstrates that vibration control and energy harvesting can be obtained simultaneously. Based on the proposed switch based energy harvesting circuit with both power regulation and force control functions, two control strategies are investigated in this paper. One is the clipped Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, where the TMD is controlled in a semi-active way with practical force constraints while electricity is harvested. The other one is an implemented energy-harvesting TMD with the duty cycle of the energy harvesting circuit controlled by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). In this case, the vibration performance is quite close to the traditional TMD while the vibration energy is converted into electricity. An experiment using the second control strategy is conducted based on a three-stories building prototype with electricity generating TMD composed of a rotational motor and rack-pinion mechanism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5991018/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12286692","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and experiment validation of simultaneous vibration control and energy harvesting from buildings using Tuned Mass Dampers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and experiment validation of simultaneous vibration control and energy harvesting from buildings using Tuned Mass Dampers","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061355S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5991020,"authors":[{"name":"Makan Fardad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Makan","lastName":"Fardad","id":"37299676200"},{"name":"Fu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Fu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37851510200"},{"name":"Mihailo R.

evaporation process of alumina production include maintaining the liquid level and fast tracking of the product density to its setpoint. Due to the strong coupling between the level control and product density control loops and high nonlinearities in the process, conventional control strategies can not achieve satisfactory control performance and meet production demands. Viewing the forced-circulation evaporation system and valves as a generalized plant, a nonlinear multi-model adaptive decoupling control strategy is proposed. The nonlinear adaptive decoupling controller includes a linear adaptive decoupling controller, a neural-network-based nonlinear adaptive decoupling controller, and a switching mechanism. The linear adaptive decoupling controller is used to reduce the coupling between the two loops. The neural-network-based nonlinear adaptive decoupling controller is employed to improve the transient performance and mitigate effects of the nonlinearities on the system, and the switching mechanism is introduced to guarantee the input-output stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results show that the proposed method can decouple the loops effectively for the forced-circulation evaporation system and can improve the evaporation efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991078","startPage":"5061","endPage":"5066","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991078.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive decoupling control of the forced-circulation evaporation system using neural networks and multiple models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991078/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive decoupling control of the forced-circulation evaporation system using neural networks and multiple models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991078/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12286752","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive decoupling control of the forced-circulation evaporation system using neural networks and multiple models","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089008S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5991082,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Basin","affiliation":["Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Nuevo Leon, Mexico"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Basin","id":"37299350200"},{"name":"Juan J.

For stability analysis, the dominant characteristic roots are obtained by using an approach based on the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function has already embedded in various commercial software packages (e.g., Matlab, Maple, and Mathematica). In a way similar to non-delay systems, stability is determined with the locations of the characteristic roots in the complex plane. Conditions for oscillation and robust stability are also given in term of the Lambert W function.

The classical optimal power flow (OPF) problem is one of such problems, which has been studied for half a century. Recently, we obtained a condition under which the duality gap is zero for the classical OPF problem and hence a globally optimal solution to this problem can be found efficiently by solving a semidefinite program. This zero-duality-gap condition is satisfied for IEEE benchmark systems and holds widely in practice due to the physical properties of transmission lines. The present paper studies the case when there are other common sources of non-convexity, such as variable shunt elements, variable transformer ratios and contingency constraints. It is shown that zero duality gap for the classical OPF problem implies zero duality gap for a general OPF-based problem with these extra sources of non-convexity. This result makes it possible to find globally optimal solutions to several fundamental power problems in polynomial time.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","startPage":"4566","endPage":"4573","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991104.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero duality gap for classical opf problem convexifies fundamental nonlinear power problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line matrix methods","Power system stability","Power transmission lines","Optimized production technology","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","concave programming","load flow","power transmission lines","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classical optimal power flow problem","fundamental nonlinear power problems","power systems","NP-hard","zero-duality-gap condition","physical quantities","active power","reactive power","IEEE benchmark systems","transmission lines","nonconvexity","variable shunt elements","variable transformer ratios","contingency constraints","polynomial time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Zero duality gap for classical opf problem convexifies fundamental nonlinear power problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991104/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991104/","accessionNumber":"12286778","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero duality gap for classical opf problem convexifies fundamental nonlinear power problems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05902S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":5991109,"authors":[{"name":"Rick Zhang","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Rick","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37957945800"},{"name":"Hugh H.T.

the synthesis problem of fixed structure robust controllers satisfying multiple control specifications. For this purpose, first, the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) with cyclic-network topology is developed. Such a neighborhood topology can ensure a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation ability of the swarm, which results in a significant reduction of the probability of premature convergence to local optima. Second, the proposed distributed PSO algorithm is incorporated with the simple constraint handling method [8] using a virtual objective function to handle multiple control specifications. Then, it is shown how to find optimal parameters of a fixed-structure controller guaranteeing the given specifications based on the developed PSO technique using cyclic-network topology. Third, a typical numerical example to demonstrate its effectiveness is given, which clearly shows that the proposed distributed PSO scheme gives a novel and powerful impetus to the fixed structure robust controller synthesis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991220/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12338282","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991220/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of fixed-structure robust controllers using the distributed particle swarm optimizer with cyclic-network topology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of fixed-structure robust controllers using the distributed particle swarm optimizer with cyclic-network topology","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080585S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5991275,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Hladio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Hladio","id":"37944964400"},{"name":"Christopher Nielsen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Nielsen","id":"37301501500"},{"name":"David Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Wang","id":"37336160100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5991275","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mechanical systems","Dynamics","Trajectory","Manipulators","Aerospace electronics","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","position control","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechanical systems","path following controllers","coordinate transformation","feedback transformation","path following control design","linear subsystems","controllable subsystems","virtual output","input-output feedback linearization","planar five-bar linkage robot","flexible link"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991275","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991275.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path following for mechanical systems: Experiments and examples","abstract":"This paper concerns the design of path following controllers for mechanical systems. Our method is to find a coordinate and feedback transformation that puts the mechanical system in a convenient form for path following control design. In this form, linear and controllable subsystems govern motions toward and along the path. We choose a particular \"virtual output\" to perform input-output feedback linearization, and characterize when this virtual output can be used. We apply this technique to a planar five-bar linkage robot, and implement it experimentally, highlighting behaviour fundamentally different from standard tracking control. In simulation, we further illustrate our approach on an underactuated five-bar robot with a flexible link.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5991275/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12338332","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Path following for mechanical systems: Experiments and examples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path following for mechanical systems: Experiments and examples","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071805S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5991285,"authors":[{"name":"Se Yong Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Se Yong","lastName":"Park","id":"38240897000"},{"name":"Anant Sahai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5991285","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Observability","Nonuniform sampling","Kalman filters","Random variables","Noise","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Kalman filters","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermittent Kalman filtering","eigenvalue cycles","critical erasure probability","physical system","continuous-time randomly-dithered nonuniform sampling","dominant eigenvalue"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991285","abstract":"We develop the concept of an eigenvalue cycle to completely characterize the critical erasure probability for intermittent Kalman filtering.

Path planners based on potential functions have been essentially static, with very limited representation of the motion of obstacles as part of their navigation model.

The use of an elliptical region signifying the predicted position and direction of motion of an obstacle is proposed in this paper. The repulsive potential caused by an obstacle is defined relative to this elliptical field. An analytic switch is made when the robot enters this predicted elliptical zone of the obstacle. The development of navigation functions makes it possible to design a potential-based planner which is guaranteed to converge to the target.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991384","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991384.pdf","startPage":"4628","endPage":"4633","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot crowd navigation using predictive position fields in the potential function framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robot crowd navigation using predictive position fields in the potential function framework","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5991384/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12338441","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991384/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot crowd navigation using predictive position fields in the potential function framework","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059249S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5991406,"authors":[{"name":"Tam\u00e1s Luspay","affiliation":["Systems and Control Laboratory, Computer and Automation Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Tam\u00e1s","lastName":"Luspay","id":"37547373700"},{"name":"Bal\u00e1zs Kulcs\u00e1r","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bal\u00e1zs","lastName":"Kulcs\u00e1r","id":"37300802000"},{"name":"Tam\u00e1s P\u00e9ni","affiliation":["Systems and Control Laboratory, Computer and Automation Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Tam\u00e1s","lastName":"P\u00e9ni","id":"37298358200"},{"name":"Istv\u00e1n Varga","affiliation":["Systems and Control Laboratory, Computer and Automation Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Istv\u00e1n","lastName":"Varga","id":"37604707100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5991406","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","Numerical models","Heuristic algorithms","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","linear systems","nonlinear control systems","road traffic","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LPV set theoretical analysis","freeway traffic flow dynamics","macroscopic model","nonlinear model","second-order model","quasilinear parameter varying representation","steady-state centering","state variable factorization","polytopic LPV model form","quasimodel reformulation","ramp metering control input signals","disturbance invariant set theory","system dynamics","physical constraint","value unmeasured disturbance signal","nonlinear macroscopic system","traffic modeling","quantitative freeway ramp metering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Set theory","ramp metering","polytopic systems","linear parameter varying representations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991406","abstract":"The paper contributes to the analysis of freeway traffic flow dynamics by set theoretic methods. First, the macroscopic, non-linear and second-order model of freeway traffic flow dynamics is transformed to an equivalent and quasi Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) representation by steady-state centering and state variable factorization. Second, a polytopic LPV model form is obtained from the quasi model reformulation. The latter polytopic LPV form is then used as a basis for the computation and analysis of disturbance invariant sets. This framework is able to characterize constrained sets of states which can be reached by pure ramp metering control input signals. Furthermore, these sets become invariant to other measured and unmeasured disturbance inputs. The application of disturbance invariant set theory provides an analytical tool for constrained freeway ramp metering describing the set of states being invariant under the system dynamics, measured disturbance and other physical constraints regardless to the value unmeasured disturbance signal. The proposed idea is fully based on the analysis of the (transformed) non-linear macroscopic system and aims at filling the gap between the traffic modeling and quantitative freeway ramp metering.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991406","startPage":"733","endPage":"738","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991406.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Freeway ramp metering: An LPV set theoretical analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Freeway ramp metering: An LPV set theoretical analysis","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991406/","accessionNumber":"12270101","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991406/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Freeway ramp metering: An LPV set theoretical analysis","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059224S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5991419,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Using a simple stochastic model for wind power production and a model for the electricity market, we show that the problem of determining optimal contract offerings for a WPP with co-located energy storage can be solved using convex programming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991431/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12270126","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991431/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The role of co-located storage for wind power producers in conventional electricity markets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of co-located storage for wind power producers in conventional electricity markets","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.165209S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5991460,"authors":[{"name":"Dennice Gayme","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dennice","lastName":"Gayme","id":"37300788400"},{"name":"Ufuk Topcu","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ufuk","lastName":"Topcu","id":"37299604900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5991460","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1027},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Generators","Energy storage","Discharges","Reactive power","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","load flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power flow","distributed energy storage dynamics","electric power industry","electric power systems","IEEE 14 bus benchmark","demand based cost functions","time-invariant functions"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power flow with distributed energy storage dynamics","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","endPage":"1542","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991460.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991460","startPage":"1536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991460","abstract":"Restructuring of the electric power industry along with mandates to integrate renewable energy sources is introducing new challenges for electric power systems and the power grid. Intermittent power sources in particular require mitigation strategies in order to maintain consistent power on the electric grid. We investigate distributed energy storage as one such strategy. Our model for optimal power flow consists of simple charge/discharge dynamics for energy storage collocated with load and/or generation buses cast as a finite-time optimal control problem. We illustrate the effects of energy storage using a modified version of the IEEE 14 bus benchmark example along with time-varying demand profiles. We use both time-invariant and demand based cost functions. The addition of energy storage along with demand based cost functions significantly reduces the generation costs and flattens the generation profiles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12270154","htmlLink":"/document/5991460/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power flow with distributed energy storage dynamics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power flow with distributed energy storage dynamics","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08886S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5991466,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahama, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Lu","id":"37536788300"},{"name":"Choon Yik Tang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahama, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Choon Yik","lastName":"Tang","id":"37424018700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5991466","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"abstract":"This paper presents a family of continuous-time distributed algorithms called Zero-Gradient-Sum (ZGS) algorithms, which solve unconstrained, separable, convex optimization problems over undirected networks with fixed topologies.

We also present a systematic way to construct ZGS algorithms, show that a subset of them converge exponentially, and obtain lower bounds on their convergence rates in terms of the convexity characteristics of the problem and the network topology, including its algebraic connectivity. Finally, we show that some of the well-studied continuous-time distributed consensus algorithms are special cases of ZGS algorithms and discuss the ramifications.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991466.pdf","startPage":"5474","endPage":"5479","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-gradient-sum algorithms for distributed convex optimization: The continuous-time case","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Nickel","Heuristic algorithms","Convex functions","Trajectory","Lyapunov methods","Distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","convergence","convex programming","distributed algorithms","gradient methods","graph theory","Lyapunov methods","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-gradient-sum algorithm","distributed convex optimization","unconstrained separable convex optimization problem","undirected network","fixed topology","Lyapunov function candidate","nonlinear networked dynamical system","invariant zero-gradient-sum manifold","asymptotic convergence","exponential convergence","convexity characteristics","algebraic connectivity","continuous-time distributed consensus algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Zero-gradient-sum algorithms for distributed convex optimization: The continuous-time case","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991466/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12270160","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-gradient-sum algorithms for distributed convex optimization: The continuous-time case","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.157868S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5991481,"authors":[{"name":"Girish Chowdhary","affiliation":["Daniel Guggenheim school of aeroSpace engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Girish","lastName":"Chowdhary","id":"37402725200"},{"name":"Eric Johnson","affiliation":["Daniel Guggenheim school of aeroSpace engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37332288200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5991481","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"abstract":"We present a singular value maximizing algorithm for recording data to be used by concurrent learning adaptive controllers.

The spherical pendulum consists of a slim cylinder attached to a universal joint upon which the planar control force acts. The aim in output tracking is to control the pendulum such that the base follows a desired reference trajectory as closely as possible while maintaining the upright position. The standard output regulator requires the solution to a mixed algebraic partial differential equation, which entails finding the manifold on which the system state trajectories result in exact tracking of the reference signal. This can be very difficult to solve in practice for the non-minimum phase case thus motivating the use of approximation methods. A local approximation method, based on a Taylor series expansion of the system dynamics is used, such that an output regulator may be applied to the spherical inverted pendulum. This gives the first application of output regulation for the output tracking of this system.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991533","startPage":"539","endPage":"544","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991533.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate output regulation for a spherical inverted pendulum","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991533/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Approximate output regulation for a spherical inverted pendulum","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991533/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12270227","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate output regulation for a spherical inverted pendulum","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098455S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5991581,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurang Shah","affiliation":["Department of Bio-and Chemical Engineering, Process Dynamics and Operations Group, TechnischeUniversit\u00e4t Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Gaurang","lastName":"Shah","id":"37541559000"},{"name":"Sebastian Engell","affiliation":["Department of Bio-and Chemical Engineering, Process Dynamics and Operations Group, TechnischeUniversit\u00e4t Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Engell","id":"37324659100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0081-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0080-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0079-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"5991581","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","MIMO","Robustness","Cost function","Transfer functions","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","convex programming","linear systems","MIMO systems","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop performance","model predictive control","process industry","penalty matrix","cost function","MPC controller","MIMO system","MPC tuning parameter","linear controller","robust linear control","semidefinite programming","convex optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991581","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2011.5991581","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","abstract":"Model Predictive Control (MPC) is widely used in the process industries. It is an optimization-based approach, where several tuning parameters such as the penalty matrices in the cost function and the prediction and control horizons must be chosen. Tuning such parameters can be challenging as they are related to the closed-loop performance in a complex manner. This problem becomes even more complicated when tuning MPC controllers for MIMO systems. This paper addresses this problem and presents a systematic approach to determine MPC tuning parameters for MIMO systems based on a specification of the desired behaviour of the loop for small changes where the MPC controller acts as a linear controller. In this manner, the robustness of the closed loop to model mismatch can be taken into account systematically using results from robust linear control theory. The approach involves solving sequentially two semidefinite programming problems (convex optimization problems), one of which is formulated in the frequency-domain. A key feature of our approach is that the tuning parameters are determined such that in the unconstrained case they guarantee a nominal robust closed-loop performance. The approach is tested on two process control examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2011.5991581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989965","startPage":"4404","endPage":"4409","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5975310/5989965/05991581.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning MPC for desired closed-loop performance for MIMO systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5991581/","displayDocTitle":"Tuning MPC for desired closed-loop performance for MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12270274","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning MPC for desired closed-loop performance for MIMO systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082519S","chronDate":"June 29 2011-July 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5975310","isNumber":"5989965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5975310","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5989965","articleId":"5991581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5991589,"authors":[{"name":"Sohrab Eslami","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sohrab","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37945011900"},{"name":"Nader Jalili","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Jalili","id":"37333031100"},{"name":"Darren M.

This controller is capable of dealing with uncertainties such as tip mass, damping coefficients and the complicated nature of the nonlinear interaction force present in the AFM systems. For this, a distributed-parameters based model for microcantilever with a tip mass is developed. On the other hand, a general interaction force between the tip and surface of the sample is assumed here which affects the microcantilever's response and due to its intrinsic nonlinearity, it adds complexity to the system. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed adaptive controller is capable of precise trajectory tracking with various applications in manipulation of and imaging systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

The stretchable patch is fabricated by injecting liquid metal alloy Galinstan into a square reservoir fabricated in the silicone elastomer substrate. An aperture-coupled feeding method is presented to enhance the strain by separating the fixed feed element from the stretched radiating element. The implemented prototype is demonstrated to be stretchable by a strain of up to 300% (and the material has the potential for more). The electrical length of the patch antenna varies with the stretching, and we demonstrate frequency tuning from 1.3 to 3 GHz. A maximum radiation efficiency of 80% is measured for the antenna. The fabrication process of the antenna system and experimental results for impedance and radiation pattern are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6082719/05991916.pdf","startPage":"4406","endPage":"4412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2165501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2165501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082719","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable Patch Antenna Using Liquid Metal Embedded in a Silicone Substrate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Antenna measurements","Patch antennas","Fabrication","Resonant frequency","Antenna radiation patterns","Reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","aperture antennas","electric impedance","liquid metals","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable patch antenna","silicone substrate","frequency-reconfigurable microstrip patch antenna","stretchable silicone TC5005 substrate","stretchable patch","liquid metal alloy","Galinstan","silicone elastomer substrate","aperture-coupled feeding","stretched radiating element","frequency tuning","maximum radiation efficiency","fabrication process","antenna system","impedance","radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperture-coupled patch antenna","reconfigurable antennas","stretchable antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable Patch Antenna Using Liquid Metal Embedded in a Silicone Substrate","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5991916/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388690","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable Patch Antenna Using Liquid Metal Embedded in a Silicone Substrate","sourcePdf":"tap-jalalimazlouman-2165501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131261S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6082719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6082719","articleId":"5991916","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5991922,"authors":[{"name":"Han Lim Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6082719/5991922/5991922-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Han Lim Lee received the B.A.Sc. degree in electronics engineering from Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada, in 2008 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests are microwave/millimeter wave circuits and RF/wireless hybrid systems, RFIC and antenna."]},"firstName":"Han Lim","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406031100"},{"name":"Won-Gyu Lim","affiliation":["Korea AeroSpace Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6082719/5991922/5991922-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Won-Gyu Lim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","During his studies for the M.S. degree, he focused on the packaging for microwave circuit on compound semiconductor substrate.

Part I starts by providing a general conceptual framework for the more detailed spectral theory to be developed in Part II. This paper proceeds by proposing a general spatial description for the electromagnetic field in the antenna exterior region based on an asymptotic interpretation of the Wilcox expansion. This description is then extended by constructing the fields in the entire exterior domain by a direct computation starting from the far-field radiation pattern. This we achieve by deriving the Wilcox expansion from the multipole expansion, which allows us to analyze the energy exchange processes between various regions in the antenna surrounding domain, spelling out the effect and contribution of each mode in an analytical fashion. The results are used subsequently to evaluate the reactive energy of arbitrary antennas in a complete form written in terms of the TE and TM modes. Finally, the concept of reactive energy is reexamined in depth to illustrate the inherent ambiguity of the circuit total electric and magnetic reactive energies. We conclude that the traditional reactive field concept is inadequate to the characterization of the antenna near field in general.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2165499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6082719/05991925.pdf","startPage":"4691","endPage":"4705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2165499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theory of Antenna Electromagnetic Near Field\u2014Part I","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991925/","displayDocTitle":"A Theory of Antenna Electromagnetic Near Field\u2014Part I","volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388699","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991925/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theory of Antenna Electromagnetic Near Field\u2014Part I","sourcePdf":"tap-mikki-2165499-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062555S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6082719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6082719","articleId":"5991925","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5991932,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Sarrazin","affiliation":["LTCI research Institute, Telecom Paris Technology, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6082719/5991932/5991932-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Julien Sarrazin received the M.Tech. and M.S. degreesin electronics from the Ecole Polytechnique de l'Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, Nantes, France, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institut de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Electronique de Nantes Atlantique (IREENA), University of Nantes, in 2008.","From 2008 to 2010, he was with the BK Birla Institute of Technology (BKBIET), Pilani, India.

At each realization of the Monte Carlo technique, the 1-D rough sea surface is randomly generated by using the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum, and the bistatic radar cross section (RCS) is computed by employing the CBFEM approach. The CBFEM is a noniterative domain decomposition finite-element algorithm, which is designed to alleviate the challenges of the conventional finite-element method in solving large-scale electromagnetic problems. The CBFEM partitions the problem into a number of nonoverlapping subdomains and generates physics-based characteristic basis functions for the representation of the fields in each subdomain. Since this approach reduces the matrix size and lends itself to convenient parallelization, it is attractive for efficiently solving large-scale problems many times in the Monte Carlo simulation with the use of direct solvers and small-sized matrices. For a number of surface realizations, each of which can be considered as a sample from the random process specifying the surface, a family of bistatic RCS values is obtained as a function of incidence angle and surface roughness (or wind speed). The coherent (mean) and incoherent (variance) components of the RCS are illustrated with particular emphasis on the effects of surface roughness and the angles near grazing. Statistical characterization is also achieved by other means, such as correlation coefficient and density functions represented by histograms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6155684/05991948.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo-Based Characteristic Basis Finite-Element Method (MC-CBFEM) for Numerical Analysis of Scattering From Objects On/Above Rough Sea Surfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface roughness","Rough surfaces","Sea surface","Surface waves","Finite element methods","Monte Carlo methods","Matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","finite element analysis","Monte Carlo methods","radar cross-sections","rough surfaces","seawater"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo based characteristic basis finite element method","object scattering","2D electromagnetic scattering","rough sea surfaces","Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum","bistatic radar cross section","RCS","noniterative domain decomposition","finite element algorithm","characteristic basis functions","surface roughness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Characteristic Basis Finite-Element Method (CBFEM)","characteristic functions","domain decomposition (DD)","electromagnetic scattering and propagation","finite-element method (FEM)","Monte Carlo","rough surface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo-Based Characteristic Basis Finite-Element Method (MC-CBFEM) for Numerical Analysis of Scattering From Objects On/Above Rough Sea Surfaces","volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5991948/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12556249","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo-Based Characteristic Basis Finite-Element Method (MC-CBFEM) for Numerical Analysis of Scattering From Objects On/Above Rough Sea Surfaces","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ozgun-2162650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144445S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6155684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6155684","articleId":"5991948","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5991949,"authors":[{"name":"Hwa Ok Lee","affiliation":["ElectroScience Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hwa Ok Lee received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, in 2005, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Her current research interests include computational electromagnetics and numerical analysis of resistivity-logging tools."]},"firstName":"Hwa Ok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37538529800"},{"name":"Fernando L.

However, due to the inherent complexity of current AIN models, their application to multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing image classification has been severely restricted. This paper presents a novel supervised AIN-namely, the artificial antibody network (ABNet), based on immune network theory-aimed at performing multi-/hyperspectral image classification. To construct the ABNet, the artificial antibody population (AB) model was utilized. AB is the set of antibodies where each antibody has two attributes-its center vector and recognizing radius-thus each can recognize all antigens within its recognizing radius. In contrast to the traditional AIN model, ABNet can adaptively obtain these two parameters by evolving the antigens without relying on user-defined parameters in the training step. During the process of training, to enlarge the recognizing range, the immune operators (such as clone, mutation, and selection) were used to enhance the AB model to find better antibody in the feature space, which may recognize as much antigen as possible. After the training process, the trained ABNet was utilized to classify the remote sensing image, exhibiting superior learning abilities. Three experiments with different types of images were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to other supervised classification algorithms: minimum distance, Gaussian maximum likelihood, back-propagation neural network, and our previously developed artificial immune classifiers-resource-limited classification of remote sensing image and multiple-valued immune network classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that ABNet has remarkable recognizing accuracy and ability to provide effective classification for multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, superior to other methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6155684/05991950.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Artificial Immune Network for Supervised Classification of Multi-/Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Immune system","Training","Hyperspectral imaging","Adaptation models","Cloning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image classification","neural nets","pattern recognition","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive artificial immune network","supervised image classification","multispectral remote sensing imagery","hyperspectral remote sensing imagery","computational intelligence model","artificial immune systems","vertebrate immune system","pattern recognition","data analysis","artificial antibody network","ABNet","antigens","Gaussian maximum likelihood","back propagation neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial immune systems (AISs)","image classification","pattern recognition","remote sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Artificial Immune Network for Supervised Classification of Multi-/Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery","volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5991950/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12556251","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Artificial Immune Network for Supervised Classification of Multi-/Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2162589-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140725S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6155684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6155684","articleId":"5991950","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5991952,"authors":[{"name":"Wenping Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6180074/5991952/5991952-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenping Cao (M'05\u2013SM'11) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical machines and drives from the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2004.","He is currently a Lecturer with Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K. His research interests are energy efficiency improvements in the design, operation, and repair of electric machines and drives.","Dr. Cao is a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology."]},"firstName":"Wenping","lastName":"Cao","id":"37277781100"},{"name":"Barrie C.

Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2165453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6180074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2165453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6180074/05991952.pdf","startPage":"3523","endPage":"3531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of Electric Motor Technologies Used for More Electric Aircraft (MEA)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Overview of Electric Motor Technologies Used for More Electric Aircraft (MEA)","volume":"59","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5991952/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12656120","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991952/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of Electric Motor Technologies Used for More Electric Aircraft (MEA)","sourcePdf":"tie-cao-2165453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112357S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6180074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"457","xplore-issue":"6180074","articleId":"5991952","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":5991956,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Raabe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6296744/5991956/5991956-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Raabe (S'04\u2013M'10) received the B.E.

The computing of the color image segmentation can be implemented in parallel on a field-programmable-gate-array chip. Furthermore, the results of segmentations are applied to an object-detection scheme. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed MPCNN is comparable to those of other popular image segmentation algorithms for the segmentation of noisy images while its parallel neural circuits improve the speed of processing drastically as compared with the sequential-code-based counterparts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6175217/05991960.pdf","startPage":"3299","endPage":"3308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2165451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2165451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6175217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5991960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel Pulse-Coupled-Neural-Network-Based Color Image Segmentation for Object Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Image segmentation","Image color analysis","Joining processes","Color","Arrays","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image colour analysis","image segmentation","object detection","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel pulse-coupled-neural network-based color image segmentation","pulse-based radial basis function unit","neuron model","spectral feature vectors","spatial proximity","field programmable gate array chip","object detection scheme","MPCNN","noisy image segmentation algorithms","parallel neural circuits","sequential-code-based counterparts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color image segmentation","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","object detection","pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN)","radial basis function (RBF) neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5991960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel Pulse-Coupled-Neural-Network-Based Color Image Segmentation for Object Detection","volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5991960/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12638413","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel Pulse-Coupled-Neural-Network-Based Color Image Segmentation for Object Detection","sourcePdf":"tie-zhuang-2165451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109989S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6175217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6175217","articleId":"5991960","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5991963,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Dinuzzo","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tubingen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6032791/5991963/5991963-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Dinuzzo received the Laurea Magistrale degree (with honors) in computer science engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics and statistics from the University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

This paper is an extension to our previous work detecting malicious code attacking security-sensitive information within a component. In particular, this paper focuses on detecting malicious code in a component that intrudes security-sensitive information in different components in an application. For this, an application system monitor(s) is designed to detect intrusion between components using the business process encapsulated in the monitor(s). The proposed approach is applied to the ATM system and B2B electronic commerce system to evaluate the performance.","doi":"10.1109/SSIRI.2011.33","publicationTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Secure Software Integration and Reliability Improvement","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Secure Software Integration and Reliability Improvement","pdfPath":"/iel5/5991610/5991983/05992000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSIRI.2011.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5991983","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Component-Based Malicious Software Engineer Intrusion Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Component-Based Malicious Software Engineer Intrusion Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992000/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12191840","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5992000/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Component-Based Malicious Software Engineer Intrusion Detection","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4453a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080832S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5991610","isNumber":"5991983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5991610","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5991983","articleId":"5992000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5992044,"authors":[{"name":"Chanjuan Li","affiliation":["School of mathematics and statistics, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Chanjuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37067220300"},{"name":"Qingguo Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Qingguo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37958114100"},{"name":"Yuli Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Yuli","lastName":"Liu","id":"37655747400"},{"name":"Qi Yao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Yao","id":"37969231000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4493-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5992044","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Encryption","Engines","Software","Software algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost efficient data cryptographic engine","general purpose CPU system","Xilinx virtex-4 FPGA device","WISHBONE bus","API","FPGA encrypt system","security data storage system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data cryptographic engine","FPGA","SHA256","AES128"]}],"abstract":"FPGA offers major advantages when using them forcryptographic applications.

Multiplication, division and square-root operations are accomplished with fixed-point methods, but addition and subtraction are considerably more challenging. Recent work has demonstrated that these operations too can be done with similar speed and accuracy to their FP equivalents, but the necessary circuitry is complex. In particular, it is dominated by the need for large ROM tables for the storage of non-linear functions. This paper describes two algorithms, a new co-transformation procedure and an improvement to an existing interpolation method, that reduce these tables to an extent that allows their easy synthesis in logic.

The twiddle multipliers required for realizing large FFTs are typically implemented with the Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm to restrict memory requirements. Recent approaches aiming to optimize the bit-widths of FFT units while satisfying a given maximum bound on Mean-Square-Error (MSE) mostly focus on the architectures with integer multipliers. They ignore the quantization error of coefficients, disabling them to analyze the exact error defined as the difference between the fixed-point circuit and the reference floating-point model. This paper presents an efficient analysis of MSE as well as an optimization algorithm for CORDIC-based FFT units, which is applicable to other Linear-Time-Invariant (LTI) circuits as

While based on concepts known from the carry-look ahead addition and from parallel prefix adders, their adaptation by the CCA takes the context of an FPGA as implementation environment into account. These typically provide carry-chain structures to accelerate the simple ripple-carry addition (RCA). Rather than contrasting this scheme with the hierarchical addition approaches favored in hard-core VLSI designs, the CCA combines the benefits of both and uses hierarchical structures to shorten the critical path, which is still left on a core carry chain. In contrast to previous studies examining the asymptotically superior parallel prefix adders on FPGAs, the CCA is shown to outperform the standard RCA already for operand widths starting at 50 bits. Wider adders such as used in extended-precision floating-point units and in cryptographic applications even benefit from increasing speedups. The concrete mapping of the CCA as achieved for current Xilinx and Altera architectures is described and shown to be very favorable so as to yield a high speedup for a very modest investment of additional LUT resources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12191580","htmlLink":"/document/5992114/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Computations on FPGA Carry Chains by Operand Compaction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Computations on FPGA Carry Chains by Operand Compaction","confLoc":"Tuebingen, Germany","sourcePdf":"4318a095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095963S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5991607","isNumber":"5992089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5991607","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5992089","articleId":"5992114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5992119,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Carlough","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Carlough","id":"37267448500"},{"name":"Adam Collura","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Collura","id":"37947790600"},{"name":"Silvia Mueller","affiliation":["IBM Deutschland Research and Development GmbH, Boeblingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Mueller","id":"37425466700"},{"name":"Michael Kroener","affiliation":["IBM Deutschland Research and Development GmbH, Boeblingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kroener","id":"37369905200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9457-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"5992119","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":382},"abstract":"Decimal floating-point Arithmetic is widely used in commercial computing applications, such as financial transactions, where rounding errors prevent the use of binary floating-point operations.

For example, an FPGA accelerated system can be 31-37 times faster than an equivalently sized conventional machine, and consume 1/39 of the power. The key to achieving the best performance in FPGA accelerators, while maintaining correctness, is optimization of arithmetic units and data types to suit the range/precision at each point in the computation. The flexibility of the FPGA to implement non-standard arithmetic, combined with a data-flow programming model that instantiates a separate unit for each arithmetic operator in the code provides a wide design space. As such, FPGA computing offers significant opportunity for arithmetic research into 'large scale' HPC applications, where there is an opportunity to move away from standard IEEE formats, either to improve precision compared to the CPU version or to increase speed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Convolution","Stacking","Optimization","Acceleration","Bandwidth","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow computing","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large scale HPC application","field programmable gate array","glue logic","CPU","conventional machine","FPGA accelerator","nonstandard arithmetic","data flow programming model","arithmetic operator","IEEE format"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Acceleration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992126","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2011.34","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 20th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel5/5991607/5992089/05992126.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2011.34","startPage":"191","endPage":"192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992089","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 20th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Large-Scale HPC Applications Using FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Large-Scale HPC Applications Using FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992126/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992126/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12191592","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Large-Scale HPC Applications Using FPGAs","confLoc":"Tuebingen, Germany","sourcePdf":"4318a191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128009S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5991607","isNumber":"5992089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5991607","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5992089","articleId":"5992126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5992189,"authors":[{"name":"Shouyuan Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Shouyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292114000"},{"name":"Zhanjie Song","affiliation":["School of Science, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhanjie","lastName":"Song","id":"37573752000"},{"name":"Jong Hyuk Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Hyuk","lastName":"Park","id":"37407048400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1228-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4470-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5992189","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Phase locked loops","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","image watermarking","orthogonal codes","random sequences","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-capacity CDMA watermarking scheme","orthogonal pseudorandom sequence subspace projection","canonical scheme","watermark extraction phase"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA watermarking","high-capacity","subspace projection","wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a high-capacity CDMA based watermarking scheme based on orthogonal pseudorandom sequence subspace projection.

Cloud Computing makes data truly mobile and a user can simply access a chosen cloud with any internet accessible device. Miller(1986) and Koblitz (1987) proposed an Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) based mechanism to provide an authentication mechanism for a user can access remote server secretly. Recently, ECC based remote authentication scheme has been used for cloud Internet and remote devices. For instance, Yang and Change proposed an ID-based remote mutual authentication with key agreement scheme for remote devices on Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem in 2009. However, in this paper, we found that their scheme still is vulnerable to insider attack and impersonation attack. Therefore, we proposed an ECC dynamic ID-Based remote mutual authentication scheme for remote devices to solve the issues. Furthermore, we analyzed our scheme to show that our scheme is more secured to authenticate users and remote servers for cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/MUE.2011.69","publicationTitle":"2011 Fifth FTRA International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Fifth FTRA International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5991611/5992167/05992208.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MUE.2011.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Advanced ECC Dynamic ID-Based Remote Mutual Authentication Scheme for Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992208/","displayDocTitle":"An Advanced ECC Dynamic ID-Based Remote Mutual Authentication Scheme for Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992208/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12191901","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Advanced ECC Dynamic ID-Based Remote Mutual Authentication Scheme for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"4470a155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067697S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5991611","isNumber":"5992167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5991611","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5992167","articleId":"5992208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5992234,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Teng","affiliation":["Applied Mathematics and Systems Lab, Ecole Centrale Paris, Chatenay Malabry, France"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Teng","id":"37531072100"},{"name":"Lei Yu","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale de Pekin, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37895444100"},{"name":"Frederic Magoules","affiliation":["Applied Mathematics and Systems Lab, Ecole Centrale Paris, Chatenay Malabry, France"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Magoules","id":"37403546700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1228-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4470-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5992234","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992234","abstract":"As a parallel programming framework, MapReduce has attracted more and more attention from both IT enterprises and research institutes that work for large dataset processing.

A File Manager is integrated to manage files transfers, so that the file transmission time is recorded and taken into account as a part of job completion time.

The high level estimation techniques are usually targeted towards ASIC designs. We evaluate the applicability of these techniques for FPGAs. The current techniques give a separate power estimation model for each IP. Instead, our method aims to develop a common power model for multiple IPs. This is made possible by the structured nature of FPGA fabrics having fixed resources - LUTs, multipliers, BRAMs, etc. We developed a statistical learning based approach that includes the effect of design specific information as well as FPGA resource utilization information. The work demonstrates the effect of varying the activity-factor of the design and the FPGA resources consumption on dynamic power, using a set of 13 IPs as benchmarks. We also study the effect of statistical clustering technique on the model accuracy. The average percentage error in the model stayed around 4%for activity-factor variation and around 6% for resource-utilization variation.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.79","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992458/5992459/05992471.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992459","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Level Power Estimation Models for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992471/","displayDocTitle":"High Level Power Estimation Models for FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992471/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12191988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Level Power Estimation Models for FPGAs","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"4447a007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050079S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5992458","isNumber":"5992459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5992458","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5992459","articleId":"5992471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5992479,"authors":[{"name":"Ciprian Seiculescu","affiliation":["LSI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ciprian","lastName":"Seiculescu","id":"37391635700"},{"name":"Srinivasan Murali","affiliation":["LSI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Srinivasan","lastName":"Murali","id":"37274207100"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"},{"name":"Giovanni De Micheli","affiliation":["LSI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"De Micheli","id":"37274174300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0803-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4447-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-3469"}],"articleNumber":"5992479","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Topology","Network topology","System-on-a-chip","Bandwidth","Benchmark testing","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","network topology","network-on-chip","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM centric NoC architecture","topology design approach","system on chips","DRAM controller","DRAM traffic","funnel-shaped pattern","SoC multimedia benchmark","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip (NoC)","DRAM"]}],"abstract":"Most communication traffic in today's System on Chips (SoC) is DRAM centric.

With the raw device soft error rate expected to remain constant in future generations, the explosion in on-chip transistor count is expected to have a corresponding impact on overall error rate. Consequently it becomes necessary to incorporate resiliency into the pipeline data path. However, existing methods like redundant execution or error correction used in memory are non-ideal for the pipeline due to their impact on overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that exploits the characteristics of Spin Transfer Torque - Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) for providing protection of all storage structures in the pipeline, namely the Reorder Buffer, Issue Queue and Load-Store Queue. We identify specific periods during an application's runtime when the MRAM can capture a ``snapshot\" of the invariant micro-architectural state and restore it later thereby reducing soft error vulnerability. We quantify the reduction in Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF) to be 32% on average, with a performance overhead of less than 6%. Further, we present a case where the proposed technique can be combined with existing soft error protection techniques like Instruction Duplication to further enhance system reliability.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.84","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992458/5992459/05992486.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992459","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Resilient Micro-architectures: Datapath Reliability Enhancement Using STT-MRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992486/","displayDocTitle":"Towards Resilient Micro-architectures: Datapath Reliability Enhancement Using STT-MRAM","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992486/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Resilient Micro-architectures: Datapath Reliability Enhancement Using STT-MRAM","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"4447a236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075561S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5992458","isNumber":"5992459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5992458","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5992459","articleId":"5992486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5992502,"authors":[{"name":"Aman Gupta","affiliation":["NTU-Rice Institute for Sustainable and Applied Infodynamics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Aman","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37932905500"},{"name":"Satyam Mandavalli","affiliation":["International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Satyam","lastName":"Mandavalli","id":"37947010900"},{"name":"Vincent J.

In this paper we attempted to resolve the problem by the use of a preferential grouping scheme to group a series of source droplets placed in the same row or same column and route each group simultaneously with priority-based stalling for intelligent collision avoidance. The objectives of the proposed method are to minimize: (i) latest arrival time, (ii) number of pins to be used and (iii) total cell utilization.

Design of a two-stage OpAmp, in 0.18\u03bcm technology, has been used as a case-study in this work.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.11","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992458/5992459/05992509.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"326","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Design of Experiment Based Approach to Variance Optimal Design of CMOS OpAmp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Design of Experiment Based Approach to Variance Optimal Design of CMOS OpAmp","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5992509/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192026","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Design of Experiment Based Approach to Variance Optimal Design of CMOS OpAmp","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"4447a325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033337S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5992458","isNumber":"5992459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5992458","xplore-issue":"5992459","articleId":"5992509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5992514,"authors":[{"name":"Pradip Kumar Sahu","affiliation":["Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Pradip Kumar","lastName":"Sahu","id":"37845602900"},{"name":"Putta Venkatesh","affiliation":["Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Putta","lastName":"Venkatesh","id":"37652320600"},{"name":"Sunilraju Gollapalli","affiliation":["Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Sunilraju","lastName":"Gollapalli","id":"37947007500"},{"name":"Santanu Chattopadhyay","affiliation":["Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Santanu","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","id":"37277128800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0803-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4447-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-3469"}],"articleNumber":"5992514","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":515},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application Mapping onto Mesh Structured Network-on-Chip Using Particle Swarm Optimization","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992458/5992459/05992514.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992459","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.21","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle swarm optimization","Transform coding","Computer architecture","Conferences","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mesh structured network-on-chip","particle swarm optimization","mapping technique","NoC","PSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip (NoC)","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Application Mapping","Mesh Topology","Application Specific NoC (ASNoC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992514","abstract":"This paper proposes a new application mapping technique for mesh based Network-on-Chip (NoC) using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Along this line, link prediction between co-authors in a co-author network is a frequently studied problem. In most of these studies, authors are considered in a homogeneous network, i.e., only one type of objects (author type) and one type of links (co-authorship) exist in the network. However, in a real bibliographic network, there are multiple types of objects (e.g., venues, topics, papers) and multiple types of links among these objects. In this paper, we study the problem of co-author relationship prediction in the heterogeneous bibliographic network, and a new methodology called PathPredict, i.e., meta path-based relationship prediction model, is proposed to solve this problem. First, meta path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-author relationships. We present experiments on a real bibliographic network, the DBLP network, which show that metapath-based heterogeneous topological features can generate more accurate prediction results as compared to homogeneous topological features. In addition, the level of significance of each topological feature can be learned from the model, which is helpful in understanding the mechanism behind the relationship building.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-author Relationship Prediction in Heterogeneous Bibliographic Networks","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2011.112","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992553/5992565/05992571.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2011.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Co-author Relationship Prediction in Heterogeneous Bibliographic Networks","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992571/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192065","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-author Relationship Prediction in Heterogeneous Bibliographic Networks","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4375a121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076695S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5992553","isNumber":"5992565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5992553","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"5992565","articleId":"5992571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5992572,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Barbieri","affiliation":["Institute for High Performance Computing and Networks (ICAR-CNR), Italian National Council of Research, Italy","Department of Electronics, Informatics and Systems (DEIS), University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Barbieri","id":"37948143200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-758-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4375-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5992572","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992572","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Predictive models","Probabilistic logic","Computational modeling","Parameter estimation","Communities","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularized Gibbs sampling","soft constraint","user rating profile model","parameter estimation","simple learning procedure","flexible learning procedure","regularization technique","recommender system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recommendations","Collaborative Filtering"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we extend the formulation of the User Rating Profile model, providing a Gibbs Sampling derivation for parameter estimation.

Link prediction in such networks must model the influences between heterogenous relationships and distinguish the formation mechanisms of each link type, a task which is beyond the simple topological features commonly used to score potential links. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistically weighted extension of the Adamic/Adar measure for heterogenous information networks, which we use to demonstrate the potential benefits of diverse evidence, particularly in cases where homogeneous relationships are very sparse. However, we also expose some fundamental flaws of traditional a priori link prediction. In accordance with previous research on homogeneous networks, we further demonstrate that a supervised approach to link prediction can enhance performance and is easily extended to the heterogeneous case. Finally, we present results on three diverse, real-world heterogeneous information networks and discuss the trends and tradeoffs of supervised and unsupervised link prediction in a multi-relational setting.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-relational Link Prediction in Heterogeneous Information Networks","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2011.107","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992553/5992565/05992590.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2011.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-relational Link Prediction in Heterogeneous Information Networks","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992590/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192084","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-relational Link Prediction in Heterogeneous Information Networks","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4375a281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15421S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5992553","isNumber":"5992565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5992553","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5992565","articleId":"5992590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5992618,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Berlingerio","affiliation":["KDDLab ISTI, CNR, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Berlingerio","id":"37394418200"},{"name":"Michele Coscia","affiliation":["KDDLab, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Coscia","id":"37394417600"},{"name":"Fosca Giannotti","affiliation":["KDDLab ISTI, CNR, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Fosca","lastName":"Giannotti","id":"37268539100"},{"name":"Anna Monreale","affiliation":["KDDLab, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Monreale","id":"37394413700"},{"name":"Dino Pedreschi","affiliation":["KDDLab, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Dino","lastName":"Pedreschi","id":"37394413600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-758-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4375-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5992618","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":716},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Social network services","Complex networks","Knowledge engineering","Correlation","Communities","Availability","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex networks","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional network analysis","complex networks","scientific community","real-world network data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["social network","multidimensional networks","multiple relations","complex networks"]}],"abstract":"Complex networks have been receiving increasing attention by the scientific community, thanks also to the increasing availability of real-world network data. In the last years, the multidimensional nature of many real world networks has been pointed out, i.e. many networks containing multiple connections between any pair of nodes have been analyzed. Despite the importance of analyzing this kind of networks was recognized by previous works, a complete framework for multidimensional network analysis is still missing. Such a framework would enable the analysts to study different phenomena, that can be either the generalization to the multidimensional setting of what happens inmonodimensional network, or a new class of phenomena induced by the additional degree of complexity that multidimensionality provides in real networks. The aim of this paper is then to give the basis for multidimensional network analysis: we develop a solid repertoire of basic concepts and analytical measures, which takes into account the general structure of multidimensional networks. We tested our framework on a real world multidimensional network, showing the validity and the meaningfulness of the measures introduced, that are able to extract important, nonrandom, information about complex phenomena.","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2011.103","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992553/5992565/05992618.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2011.103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Foundations of Multidimensional Network Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Foundations of Multidimensional Network Analysis","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5992618/","accessionNumber":"12192112","publicationDate":"July 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Foundations of Multidimensional Network Analysis","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4375a485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043157S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5992553","isNumber":"5992565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5992553","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5992565","articleId":"5992618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5992659,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Hou","affiliation":["School of Humanities, Dalian University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Hou","id":"37959544300"},{"name":"Han Chen","affiliation":["School of Energy & Environment, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Chen","id":"37966204400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-758-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4375-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5992659","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992659","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Renewable energy resources","Visualization","Software","USA Councils","Energy consumption","Educational institutions","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["citation analysis","graph theory","information retrieval","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["countries cocitation network","international energy technology","countries cooperation networks","graph-theoretical approach","CiteSpace","web of science","SSCI database index","document retrieval"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["International energy technology","information visualization","country co-citation network","CiteSpace"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2011.23","endPage":"552","startPage":"551","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992553/5992565/05992659.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2011.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Countries Co-citation Network and Research Fronts of International Energy Technology","abstract":"In this article, we draw countries cooperation networks joint with their research fronts of international energy technology.

Even though the frameworks are very accurate, the use of special functions hides some fundamental properties of the aforementioned new modulation schemes, e.g., coding and diversity gains. In this Letter, we exploit a notable limit involving the Meijer-G function near the singular point -1, and provide a simple, closed-form, and asymptotically tight upper-bound of the ABEP. The result is applicable to SM and SSK modulation, to correlated Nakagami-m fading, and to general Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless systems. As a case study, numerical examples showing the accuracy for SSK modulation are given, and it is proved that, unlike conventional modulations, the diversity gain is independent of the fading severity m.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit Error Probability of Space Modulation over Nakagami-m Fading: Asymptotic Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.080811.110873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6061509/05992700.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.080811.110873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","displayDocTitle":"Bit Error Probability of Space Modulation over Nakagami-m Fading: Asymptotic Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5992700/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317841","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit Error Probability of Space Modulation over Nakagami-m Fading: Asymptotic Analysis","sourcePdf":"1026-cl1110-direnzo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041163S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6061509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6061509","articleId":"5992700","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5992701,"authors":[{"name":"M.-T O.

The optimum trade-off depends not only on the maximum outage probability allowed by the primary user and the number of cognitive users involved in the sensing but also on the fading operational conditions of the cognitive radio. The parameters of the Nakagami fading distribution can be adjusted to fit different fading environments. The fading parameter (also called shape parameter) of the Nakagami distribution affects the optimum sensing time, which increases when the fading conditions are worse than Rayleigh fading. For the energy detector, the expression for the probability of false alarm is obtained in terms of a new threshold, which is derived considering an outage constraint on the channel-dependent probability of detection. Then, the optimization problem is formulated. Simulation results quantify the effects of different fading parameters on the optimum spectrum sensing duration.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.080811.111127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6061509/05992703.pdf","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.080811.111127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sensing and Throughput Trade-off in Cognitive Radio under Outage Constraints over Nakagami Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992703/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing and Throughput Trade-off in Cognitive Radio under Outage Constraints over Nakagami Fading","volume":"15","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317844","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992703/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing and Throughput Trade-off in Cognitive Radio under Outage Constraints over Nakagami Fading","sourcePdf":"1110-cl1110-juarez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037071S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6061509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6061509","articleId":"5992703","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5992705,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey J.

Simulation results show that the proposed codes can reduce the gap to the theoretical bounds by up to 56% compared to traditional codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6061509/05992705.pdf","startPage":"1100","endPage":"1103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.080811.111232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.080811.111232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6061509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPCA Code Construction for Slepian-Wolf Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Reliability","Entropy","Source coding","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","parity check codes","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPCA code construction","Slepian-Wolf coding","error correcting codes","distributed source coding","error distribution prediction","rate-adaptive low-density parity-check codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed source coding","rate-adaptive LDPC codes","Slepian-Wolf theorem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"LDPCA Code Construction for Slepian-Wolf Coding","volume":"15","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5992705/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317846","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPCA Code Construction for Slepian-Wolf Coding","sourcePdf":"1100-cl1110-micallef.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032292S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6061509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6061509","articleId":"5992705","onlineDate":"18 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":5992706,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Benevides da Costa","affiliation":["Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel Benevides","lastName":"da Costa","id":"37889884300"},{"name":"Michel Daoud Yacoub","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Laboratory (WissTek), State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Michel Daoud","lastName":"Yacoub","id":"37272286500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5992706","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":961},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Relays","Wireless communication","Interchannel interference","Approximation methods","Monte Carlo methods","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cochannel interference","cooperative communication","Monte Carlo methods","Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two hop AF relaying system","Nakagami-m fading","dual-hop amplify-and-forward cooperative network","multiple cochannel interferer","end-to-end outage probability","Meijer G-function","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative systems","co-channel interference","moment-based estimators","Nakagami-m fading"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates the outage performance of dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative networks in the presence of multiple co-channel interferers at both the relay and destination nodes and subject to non-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading.

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for BS energy saving that encompasses dynamic BS operation and the related problem of user association together. Specifically, we formulate a total cost minimization that allows for a flexible tradeoff between flow-level performance and energy consumption. For the user association problem, we propose an optimal energy-efficient user association policy and further present a distributed implementation with provable convergence. For the BS operation problem (i.e., BS switching on/off), which is a challenging combinatorial problem, we propose simple greedy-on and greedy-off algorithms that are inspired by the mathematical background of submodularity maximization problem. Moreover, we propose other heuristic algorithms based on the distances between BSs or the utilizations of BSs that do not impose any additional signaling overhead and thus are easy to implement in practice. Extensive simulations under various practical configurations demonstrate that the proposed user association and BS operation algorithms can significantly reduce energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","volume":"29","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12213544","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5992823/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Base Station Operation and User Association Mechanisms for Energy-Delay Tradeoffs in Green Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base Station Operation and User Association Mechanisms for Energy-Delay Tradeoffs in Green Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"1525jsac0811son.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080544S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"343","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5992824,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5992818/5992824/5992824-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Liang Chen was born in Tainan, Taiwan.

Its minimum energy consumption is formulated as an optimization problem. By taking both transmit antennas (TAs) and receive antennas (RAs) into consideration, the energy-bandwidth efficiency tradeoff in the networks is investigated. Moreover, the minimum energy of an equally-spaced relaying strategy is investigated for various numbers of antennas. In addition, the minimum energy over all possible antenna pairs is derived. Finally, the effect of the number of hops on the energy-bandwidth efficiency tradeoff is considered. For a fixed antenna pair, the minimum energy over all possible rates and hop numbers are obtained. Generally, the routes with more hops minimize the energy consumption in the low effective rate region. On the other hand, in the high effective rate region, the routes with fewer hops minimize the energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992824/","volume":"29","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5992824/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12213545","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Bandwidth Efficiency Tradeoff in MIMO Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Bandwidth Efficiency Tradeoff in MIMO Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"1537jsac0811chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055313S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992824","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5992825,"authors":[{"name":"Yinan Qi","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5992818/5992825/5992825-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yinan Qi received the B.Sc degree in Electronics and Information Theory and the M.Sc degree in mobile communications from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D degree in Electronic Engineering from University of Surrey, Surrey, United Kingdom.

The strategies allow the relay to dynamically switch between amplify-and-forward/compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward schemes according to its decoding status. The performance analysis is conducted from both the spectrum and energy efficiency perspectives. The spectrum efficiency of the proposed strategies, in terms of the maximum throughput, is significantly improved compared with their non-hybrid counterparts under the same constraints. The consumed energy per bit is optimized by manipulating the node activation time, the transmission energy and the power allocation between the source and the relay. The circuitry energy consumption of all involved nodes is taken into consideration. Numerical results shed light on how and when the energy efficiency can be improved in cooperative HARQ. For instance, cooperative HARQ is shown to be energy efficient in long distance transmission only. Furthermore, we consider the fact that the compress-and-forward scheme requires instantaneous signal to noise ratios of all three constituent links. However, this requirement can be impractical in some cases. In this regard, we introduce an improved strategy where only partial and affordable channel state information feedback is needed.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110905","startPage":"1547","endPage":"1558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992818","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5992818/05992825.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"H2-ARQ-Relaying: Spectrum and Energy Efficiency Perspectives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992825/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"H2-ARQ-Relaying: Spectrum and Energy Efficiency Perspectives","volume":"29","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5992825/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12206251","publicationDate":"September 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"H2-ARQ-Relaying: Spectrum and Energy Efficiency Perspectives","sourcePdf":"1547jsac0811qi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063892S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5992826,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["ICTEAM Institute, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5992818/5992826/5992826-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Wang received respectively B.E.

This paper addresses the sum rate maximized resource allocation (RA) problem in an orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM) transmission system assisted by multiple decode-and-forward (DF) relays, subject to the individual sum power constraints of the source and the relays. In particular, the transmission at each subcarrier can be in either the direct mode without any relay assisting, or the relay-aided mode with one or several relays assisting. We propose two RA algorithms which optimize the assignment of transmission mode and source power for every subcarrier, as well as the assisting relays and the power allocation to them for every {relay-aided} subcarrier. First, it is shown that the considered RA problem has zero Lagrangian duality gap when there is a big number of subcarriers. In this case, a duality based algorithm that finds a globally optimum RA is developed. Most interestingly, the sensitivity analysis in convex optimization theory is used to derive a closed-form optimum solution to a related convex optimization problem, for which the method based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is not applicable. Second, a coordinate-ascent based iterative algorithm, which finds a suboptimum RA but is always applicable regardless of the duality gap of the RA problem, is developed. The effectiveness of these algorithms has been illustrated by numerical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5992818/05992826.pdf","startPage":"1559","endPage":"1571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum Rate Maximized Resource Allocation in Multiple DF Relays Aided OFDM Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992826/","displayDocTitle":"Sum Rate Maximized Resource Allocation in Multiple DF Relays Aided OFDM Transmission","volume":"29","issue":"8","publicationDate":"September 2011","accessionNumber":"12213546","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992826/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Rate Maximized Resource Allocation in Multiple DF Relays Aided OFDM Transmission","sourcePdf":"1559jsac0811wang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12685S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5992833,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan J.

In this paper, we focus on the energy efficiency of a cognitive radio network, in which a secondary user senses the channels licensed to some primary users sequentially before it decides to transmit. Energy is consumed in both the channel sensing and transmission processes. The energy-efficient design calls for a careful design in the sensing-access strategies and the sensing order, with the sensing strategy specifying when to stop sensing and start transmission, the access strategy specifying the power level to be used upon transmission, and the sensing order specifying the sequence of channel sensing. Hence, the objective of this paper is to identify the sensing-access strategies and the sensing order that achieve the maximum energy efficiency. We first investigate the design when the channel sensing order is given and formulate the above design problem as a stochastic sequential decision-making problem. To solve it, we study another parametric formulation of the original problem, which rewards transmission throughput and penalizes energy consumption. Dynamic programming can be applied to identify the optimal strategy for the parametric problem. Then, by exploring the relationship between the two formulations and making use of the monotonicity property of the parametric formulation, we develop an algorithm to find the optimal sensing-access strategies for the original problem. Furthermore, we study the joint design of the channel sensing order and the sensing-access strategies. Lastly, the performance of the proposed designs is evaluated through numerical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992834/","volume":"29","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5992834/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12206257","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Design of Sequential Channel Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks: Optimal Sensing Strategy, Power Allocation, and Sensing Order","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Design of Sequential Channel Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks: Optimal Sensing Strategy, Power Allocation, and Sensing Order","sourcePdf":"1648jsac0811pei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06102S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5992835,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Fazel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5992818/5992835/5992835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fatemeh Fazel received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran in 2000 and the M.S. degree from University of Southern California in 2002.

The proposed scheme is suitable for long-term deployment of large underwater networks, in which saving energy and bandwidth is of crucial importance. During each frame, a randomly chosen subset of nodes participate in the sensing process, then share the channel using random access. Due to the nature of random access, packets may collide at the fusion center. To account for the packet loss that occurs due to collisions, the network design employs the concept of sufficient sensing probability. With this probability, sufficiently many data packets - as required for field reconstruction based on compressed sensing - are to be received. The RACS scheme prolongs network life-time while employing a simple and distributed scheme which eliminates the need for scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5992818/05992835.pdf","startPage":"1660","endPage":"1670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Access Compressed Sensing for Energy-Efficient Underwater Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Random Access Compressed Sensing for Energy-Efficient Underwater Sensor Networks","volume":"29","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2011","accessionNumber":"12206258","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992835/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Access Compressed Sensing for Energy-Efficient Underwater Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"1660jsac0811fazel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064216S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5992836,"authors":[{"name":"Kobi Cohen","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5992818/5992836/5992836-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kobi Cohen received the B.Sc.(cum laude) in electrical engineering from Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel, in 2007.

We formulate the access problem as a history-dependent decision process. The optimal solution is mathematically intractable and suffers from exponential complexity as a function of model size. Hence, we propose an approximate solution using the Markov property to reduce complexity and make the problem mathematically tractable.

Though RFID tags (transponders) can be passive, the high power consumption of RFID readers (interrogators) has become a critical issue as handheld and mobile readers are increasingly available in pervasive computing environments. Moreover, high transmission power aggravates interference, complicating the deployment and operation of RFID systems. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient RFID inventory algorithm called Automatic Power Stepping (APS). The design of APS is based on extensive empirical study on passive tags, and takes into consideration several important details such as tag response states and variable slot lengths. APS dynamically estimates the number of tags to be read, incrementally adjusts the transmission power level to use sufficient but not excessive power for communication, and consequently reduces both the energy consumption for reading a set of tags and the possibility of collisions. We design APS to be compatible with the current Class-1 Generation-2 RFID standards so that a reader running APS can interact with existing commercial tags without modification. We have implemented APS both on an NI RFID testing platform and in a high-fidelity simulator. The evaluation shows that APS can save more than 60% energy used by RFID readers while maintaining comparable performance on the read rate.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110917","startPage":"1684","endPage":"1697","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5992818/05992837.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Read More with Less: An Adaptive Approach to Energy-Efficient RFID Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","displayDocTitle":"Read More with Less: An Adaptive Approach to Energy-Efficient RFID Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","volume":"29","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992837/","accessionNumber":"12206259","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992837/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Read More with Less: An Adaptive Approach to Energy-Efficient RFID Systems","sourcePdf":"1684jsac0811xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063389S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5992838,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Wang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5992818/5992838/5992838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beibei Wang (S'07-M'11) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering (with the highest honor) from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2009.

In this paper, we argue and show that the time-reversal (TR) signal transmission is an ideal paradigm for green wireless communications because of its inherent nature to fully harvest energy from the surrounding environment by exploiting the multi-path propagation to re-collect all the signal energy that would have otherwise been lost in most existing communication paradigms. A green wireless technology must ensure low energy consumption and low radio pollution to others than the intended user. In this paper, we show through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experiment measurements that the TR wireless communications, compared to the conventional direct transmission using a Rake receiver, reveals significant transmission power reduction, achieves high interference alleviation ratio, and exhibits large multi-path diversity gain. As such it is an ideal paradigm for the development of green wireless systems. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show an order of magnitude improvement in terms of transmit power reduction and interference alleviation. Experimental measurements in a typical indoor environment also demonstrate that the transmit power with TR based transmission can be as low as 20% of that without TR, and the average radio interference (thus radio pollution) even in a nearby area can be up to 6dB lower. A strong time correlation is found to be maintained in the multi-path channel even when the environment is varying, which indicates high bandwidth efficiency can be achieved in TR radio communications.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110918","startPage":"1698","endPage":"1710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5992818/05992838.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green Wireless Communications: A Time-Reversal Paradigm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Green Wireless Communications: A Time-Reversal Paradigm","volume":"29","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206260","publicationDate":"September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5992838/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Wireless Communications: A Time-Reversal Paradigm","sourcePdf":"1698jsac0811wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067748S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5992840,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Akif Antepli","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Eng.

A distinct characteristic of these systems is the fact that the nodes can harvest energy throughout the duration in which communication takes place. As such, transmission policies of the nodes need to adapt to these harvested energy arrivals. In this paper, we consider optimization of point-to-point data transmission with an energy harvesting transmitter which has a limited battery capacity, communicating in a wireless fading channel. We consider two objectives: maximizing the throughput by a deadline, and minimizing the transmission completion time of the communication session. We optimize these objectives by controlling the time sequence of transmit powers subject to energy storage capacity and causality constraints. We, first, study optimal offline policies. We introduce a directional water-filling algorithm which provides a simple and concise interpretation of the necessary optimality conditions. We show the optimality of an adaptive directional water-filling algorithm for the throughput maximization problem. We solve the transmission completion time minimization problem by utilizing its equivalence to its throughput maximization counterpart. Next, we consider online policies. We use stochastic dynamic programming to solve for the optimal online policy that maximizes the average number of bits delivered by a deadline under stochastic fading and energy arrival processes with causal channel state feedback. We also propose near-optimal policies with reduced complexity, and numerically study their performances along with the performances of the offline and online optimal policies under various different configurations.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110921","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5992818/05992841.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission with Energy Harvesting Nodes in Fading Wireless Channels: Optimal Policies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Transmission with Energy Harvesting Nodes in Fading Wireless Channels: Optimal Policies","volume":"29","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206263","publicationDate":"September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5992841/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission with Energy Harvesting Nodes in Fading Wireless Channels: Optimal Policies","sourcePdf":"1732jsac0811ozel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068446S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"852","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5992842,"authors":[{"name":"Pulkit Grover","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5992818/5992842/5992842-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pulkit Grover (B.

However, communication links are increasingly operating at shorter ranges where transmit power can be significantly smaller than the power consumed in decoding. This paper models the required decoding power and investigates the minimization of total system power from two complementary perspectives. First, an isolated point-to-point link is considered. Using new lower bounds on the complexity of message-passing decoding, lower bounds are derived on decoding power. These bounds show that 1) there is a fundamental tradeoff between transmit and decoding power; 2) unlike the implications of the traditional \"waterfall\" curve which focuses on transmit power, the total power must diverge to infinity as error probability goes to zero; 3) Regular LDPCs, and not their known capacity-achieving irregular counterparts, can be shown to be power order optimal in some cases; and 4) the optimizing transmit power is bounded away from the Shannon limit. Second, we consider a collection of links. When systems both generate and face interference, coding allows a system to support a higher density of transmitter-receiver pairs (assuming interference is treated as noise). However, at low densities, uncoded transmission may be more power-efficient in some cases.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5992818/05992842.pdf","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Communication-Theoretic Understanding of System-Level Power Consumption","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5992842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards a Communication-Theoretic Understanding of System-Level Power Consumption","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5992842/","publicationDate":"September 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12213550","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5992842/","volume":"29","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a Communication-Theoretic Understanding of System-Level Power Consumption","sourcePdf":"1744jsac0811grover.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165522S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5992818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5992818","articleId":"5992842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5993003,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To address this issue, we have adapted the conventional electromagnetic finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) PIC algorithm to run efficiently on high-performance, low-cost Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) hardware, making use of the NVIDIA CUDA library. Executing on a single NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 graphics card, we achieve amortized simulation times of ~1ns/cell/time-step for electromagnetic fields, using the FDTD algorithm, and ~10ns/particle/time-step for a charge-conserving Boris-push particle integration algorithm. A simulation with 500,000 cells and 200,000 particles running for 300,000 time-steps takes less than 15 minutes. A significant restriction on the performance achieved by FDTD-PIC in practice is due to the Courant condition. To achieve numerical stability, the time-step that may be used is limited to c\u0394t <;h/\u221a3, where h characterizes the smallest cell dimension in the grid. For simulations in structures that are small compared to the RF wavelength, or that require fine grids locally to resolve critical details, it is necessary to use time steps that are very small in relation to the RF period, typically c\u0394t <;\u03bb /100 . To avoid this constraint we have formulated efficient alternating-direction implicit (ADI) FDTD algorithms, now implemented for the GPU. We compare the performance of these algorithms with conventional FDTD for PIC simulation.This work forms the basis of a new code, NEPTUNE, being developed to perform self-consistent 3D nonlinear simulations of vacuum electron devices.","doi":"10.1109/PLASMA.2011.5993003","publicationTitle":"2011 Abstracts IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Abstracts IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978848/5992877/05993003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLASMA.2011.5993003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992877","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-accelerated 3D electromagnetic PIC simulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GPU-accelerated 3D electromagnetic PIC simulations","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993003/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182902","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5993003/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-accelerated 3D electromagnetic PIC simulations","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"IO4B5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047117S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978848","isNumber":"5992877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978848","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5992877","articleId":"5993003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5993390,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The production of a nonthermal plasma discharge in non-potable liquid water has shown the capacity to break down and remove contaminates, sterilizing the liquid. The plasma-water interaction creates copious amounts of short-lived radicals, electrons, excited species, ultrasound and UV photons, which react with contaminants in the liquid. All together, they have the ability to destroy microbial, bacterial and viral particles and drive the decomposition of toxic organic compounds. Key to the practical implementation of this novel water purification method is carrying out the processing at acceptable input power levels. This is to say, the electrical efficiency of the plasma-based method must be reasonably high. In general, the ideal system for point-of-use water treatment applications must also be amenable to low power operation, as is required in those regions with limited access to electrical power. Presented here are results of a detailed study of the power dissipation in an underwater DBD plasma jet currently under study for water treatment applications. Conversion and electrical efficiency is compared to conventional methods of water treatment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power studies of an underwater DBD plasma jet","publicationTitle":"2011 Abstracts IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","doi":"10.1109/PLASMA.2011.5993390","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Abstracts IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5978848/5992877/05993390.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLASMA.2011.5993390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Power studies of an underwater DBD plasma jet","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993390/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12190956","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power studies of an underwater DBD plasma jet","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"IP3L26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020141S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5978848","isNumber":"5992877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5978848","xplore-issue":"5992877","articleId":"5993390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5993410,"authors":[{"name":"Hany Hazfiza Manap","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Hazfiza Manap","id":"37949831600"},{"name":"Nooritawati Md Tahir","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nooritawati","lastName":"Md Tahir","id":"37315644200"},{"name":"Ahmad Ihsan Mohamed Yassin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Ahmad Ihsan Mohamed Yassin","id":"38180572800"},{"name":"Ramli Abdullah","affiliation":["CRIM, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ramli","lastName":"Abdullah","id":"37969158800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1255-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1254-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5993410","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinetic theory","Kinematics","Artificial neural networks","Training","Legged locomotion","Force","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","gait analysis","medical computing","neural nets","pattern classification","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly gait classification","Parkinson disease","artificial neural network","gait deviation","data fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parkinson disease","gait analysis","artificial neural network","kinetic","kinematic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993410","abstract":"The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as classifier for distinguishing gait pattern between normal healthy subjects and Parkinson Disease (PD) patients.

The visual information transmitted in form of image is naturally corrupted by Gaussian noise which is classical problem in image processing. This additive random noise can be removed using wavelet denoising technique due to the ability to capture the energy of a signal in few energy transform values. In this paper, an investigation has been made on suitability wavelet thresholding and translation invariant methods of image denoising to remove noise using orthogonal wavelet basis. The performance of the image denoising is shown in terms of PSNR and visual performance. The result shown translation invariant gave better PSNR and visual performance than wavelet transform method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on System Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5980619/5993403/05993447.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"191","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on System Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICSEngT.2011.5993447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSEngT.2011.5993447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993403","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Still image denoising based on discrete wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis","Image denoising","PSNR","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","discrete wavelet transform","media communication industry","DWT","Gaussian noise","additive random noise","wavelet denoising technique","energy transform values","translation invariant methods","PSNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio)","DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Still image denoising based on discrete wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993447/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12182996","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","conferenceDate":"27-28 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Still image denoising based on discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035512S","chronDate":"27-28 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5980619","isNumber":"5993403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5980619","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5993403","articleId":"5993447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5993456,"authors":[{"name":"Nani Fadzlina Naim","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineeering Universitit Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nani Fadzlina","lastName":"Naim","id":"37545464800"},{"name":"Ahmad Ihsan Mohd Yassin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineeering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia","Faculty of Electrical Engineeering Universitit Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ahmad Ihsan Mohd","lastName":"Yassin","id":"37320530100"},{"name":"Nurafizah Binti Zakaria","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineeering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia","Faculty of Electrical Engineeering Universitit Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Selangor, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Nurafizah Binti Zakaria","id":"37087913822"},{"name":"Norfishah Ab.

A deterministic test signal-based digital background calibration is used to accurately set the cancellation gain and thus achieve accurate cancellation under different process, voltage, temperature, and operating frequency conditions. A hybrid, linear proportional control and bang-bang digital integral control, is used to obviate the need for a high-resolution time-to-digital converter and reduce jitter due to frequency quantization error. Fabricated in 0.13 m CMOS technology, the DPLL operates from a 1.0 V supply and achieves an operating range of 0.4-to-3 GHz. At 1.5 GHz, the DPLL consumes 2.65 mW power wherein the cancellation circuitry consumes about 280 W. The proposed noise cancellation scheme reduces the DPLL's peak-to-peak jitter from 330 to 50 ps in the presence of a 30 mV 10 MHz supply noise tone, and the DPLL peak-to-peak jitter is 50 ps in the absence of any supply noise.

As the key technology to realize 0.5 V operation DRAM, this paper proposes the word-line booster circuit. The theoretical equation of the output voltage and the energy consumption of the proposed booster is extensively investigated. The proposed booster outputs 1.4 V in 3 clock cycles, which is shorter than the DRAM access time and the power consumption is 60 pJ. 1.4 V is the required word-line voltage to successfully charge the DRAM cell capacitor. Compared with the conventional boosters, the rising time and the power consumption are decreased to 38% and 68%, respectively, with the same circuit area. The proposed circuit was fabricated with the 0.18 \u03bcm standard CMOS process and the high-speed boosting is experimentally demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.5 V Operation - Loss Compensated DRAM Word-Line Booster Circuit for Ultra-Low Power VLSI Systems","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2163355","startPage":"2406","endPage":"2415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2163355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6031177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6031177/05993465.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A 0.5 V Operation <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$V _{\\rm TH}$</tex></formula> Loss Compensated DRAM Word-Line Booster Circuit for Ultra-Low Power VLSI Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5993465/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12261998","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.5 V Operation <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$V _{\\rm TH}$</tex></formula> Loss Compensated DRAM Word-Line Booster Circuit for Ultra-Low Power VLSI Systems","sourcePdf":"jssc-tanakamaru-2163355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078224S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6031177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6031177","articleId":"5993465","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5993467,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Ramadan","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Eastern Mediterranean University, Mersin, Turkey"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Ramadan","id":"37284488200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5993467","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"General formulations of the alternating direction implicit finite difference time domain method are presented for modeling multi-term dispersive electromagnetic applications.

In the first part, the linear-programming (LP) decoder for binary linear codes is extended to perform joint-decoding of binary-input FSCs. In particular, we provide a rigorous definition of LP joint-decoding pseudo-codewords (JD-PCWs) that enables evaluation of the pairwise error probability between codewords and JD-PCWs in AWGN. This leads naturally to a provable upper bound on decoder failure probability. If the channel is a finite-state intersymbol interference channel, then the joint LP decoder also has the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property and all integer-valued solutions are codewords. In this case, the performance loss relative to ML decoding can be explained completely by fractional-valued JD-PCWs. After deriving these results, we discovered some elements were equivalent to earlier work by Flanagan on linear-programming receivers. In the second part, we develop an efficient iterative solver for the joint LP decoder discussed in the first part. In particular, we extend the approach of iterative approximate LP decoding, proposed by Vontobel and Koetter and analyzed by Burshtein, to this problem. By taking advantage of the dual-domain structure of the joint-decoding LP, we obtain a convergent iterative algorithm for joint LP decoding whose structure is similar to BCJR-based turbo equalization (TE). The result is a joint iterative decoder whose per-iteration complexity is similar to that of TE but whose performance is similar to that of joint LP decoding. The main advantage of this decoder is that it appears to provide the predictability and superior performance of joint LP decoding with the computational complexity of TE. One expected application is coding for magnetic storage where the required block-error rate is extremely low and system performance is difficult to verify by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2165525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2165525","startPage":"1563","endPage":"1576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6069495/05993490.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Decoding of LDPC Codes and Finite-State Channels Via Linear-Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Decoding of LDPC Codes and Finite-State Channels Via Linear-Programming","volume":"5","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5993490/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Decoding of LDPC Codes and Finite-State Channels Via Linear-Programming","sourcePdf":"jstsp-kim-2165525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129781S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6069495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6069495","articleId":"5993490","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5993491,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yao","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China","College of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37952470000"},{"name":"Qinhong Zheng","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China","College of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Qinhong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37870881500"},{"name":"Jinhui Peng","affiliation":["Faculty of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Jinhui","lastName":"Peng","id":"37292657300"},{"name":"Runeng Zhong","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Runeng","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37872392500"},{"name":"Shenghui Li","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Shenghui","lastName":"Li","id":"37963763500"},{"name":"Tai Xiang","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Tai","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37956052800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5993491","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dielectrics","Resonant frequency","Microwave photonics","Microwave communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric resonators","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient 2D FDTD method","asymmetric parallel-plate dielectric resonators","efficient two-dimensional FDTD method","three-dimensional electromagnetic problems","3D electromagnetic problems","z-dependence","compact 2D FDTD method","perfect matched layer","PML","cylindrical resonator","ring resonator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (2-D FDTD) method","parallel-plate dielectric resonator","perfect matched layer (PML)","resonant frequency"]}],"abstract":"An efficient two-dimensional (2-D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is presented for the analysis of parallel-plate dielectric resonator.

The substrate is heat stabilized polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) which allows the antennas to be flexible. The antennas are fed by a microstrip-to-coplanar feed network balun. The reduction of the metallization is based on the observation that the majority of the current density is confined towards the edges of the regular bow-tie antenna. Hence, the centers of the triangular parts of the conventional bow-tie antenna are removed without compromising significantly its performance. The return losses and radiation patterns of the antennas are simulated with HFSS and the results are compared with measurements, for bow-tie elements mounted on flat and curved surfaces. The comparisons show that there is an excellent agreement between the simulations and measurements for both cases. Furthermore, the radiation performance of the modified bow-tie antenna is verified, by simulations and measurements, to be very close to the conventional bow-tie.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2165511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6082719/05993500.pdf","startPage":"4425","endPage":"4435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2165511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, Simulation, Fabrication and Testing of Flexible Bow-Tie Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993500/","displayDocTitle":"Design, Simulation, Fabrication and Testing of Flexible Bow-Tie Antennas","volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388712","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993500/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Simulation, Fabrication and Testing of Flexible Bow-Tie Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-balanis-2165511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093746S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6082719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6082719","articleId":"5993500","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5993501,"authors":[{"name":"Mudar A.

This feature is of practical importance if these lenses are to be used in beam-scanning antenna applications.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2165515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6082719/05993501.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2165515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082719","startPage":"4542","endPage":"4552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Planar Microwave Lenses Using Sub-Wavelength Spatial Phase Shifters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Planar Microwave Lenses Using Sub-Wavelength Spatial Phase Shifters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388713","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5993501/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Planar Microwave Lenses Using Sub-Wavelength Spatial Phase Shifters","sourcePdf":"tap-behdad-2165515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075515S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6082719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"6082719","articleId":"5993501","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5993503,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Jian Cheng","affiliation":["EHF Key Lab of Fundamental Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yu Jian","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37405376600"},{"name":"Yong Fan","affiliation":["EHF Key Lab of Fundamental Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Fan","id":"37293522400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5993503","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3115},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Antenna measurements","Antenna arrays","Optical waveguides","Horn antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","millimetre wave antenna arrays","slot antenna arrays","substrate integrated waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave miniaturized substrate integrated multibeam antenna","substrate integrated waveguide","asymmetric multimode beamforming network","compact antipodal linearly tapered slot antenna array","frequency 33.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Miniaturization","multibeam antenna","multimode","substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Miniaturized Substrate Integrated Multibeam Antenna","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2165497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082719","endPage":"4844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6082719/05993503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2165497","startPage":"4840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993503","abstract":"Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) presents an excellent candidate in the development of millimeter-wave integrated printed multibeam antenna depending on its inherent advantages.

Such a structure can be considered as an asymmetric multimode beamforming network (BFN) directly integrated with a compact antipodal linearly tapered slot antenna (ALTSA) array without additional phase shifters or connection lines. It has smaller circuit size compared with the state-of-the-art SIW multibeam antenna technology.

The IFT method makes use of the property that for an array with periodic element spacing, an inverse Fourier transform relationship exists between the array factor and the element excitations. This property is used in an iterative way to derive the array element excitations from the prescribed array factor using a direct Fourier transform. With some simple additions, the same IFT technique is also applicable to mitigate the degradation of sidelobe performance of array antenna caused by quantization of its taper across the array when using discrete control devices. Numerical examples of low sidelobe pattern synthesis applying compensation for taper quantization errors are presented.

These antennas are based on an interaction between a cylindrical surface-wave excited by an omnidirectional probe and a inhomogeneous surface impedance with a spiral pattern. The surface impedance interaction transforms a bounded surface wave into a circularly polarized leaky wave with almost broadside radiation. The problem is studied by adiabatically matching the local 2D solution of a modulated surface-impedance problem to the actual surface. Analytical expressions are derived for the far-field radiation pattern; on this basis, universal design curves for antenna gain are given and a design procedure is outlined. Two types of practical solutions are presented, which are relevant to different implementations of the impedance modulation: i) a grounded dielectric slab with a spiral-sinusoidal thickness and ii) a texture of dense printed patches with sizes variable with a spiral-sinusoidal function. Full wave results are compared successfully with the analytical approximations. Both the layouts represent good solutions for millimeter wave CP antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6082719/05993513.pdf","startPage":"4436","endPage":"4444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2165691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2165691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082719","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiral Leaky-Wave Antennas Based on Modulated Surface Impedance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leaky wave antennas","Surface impedance","Impedance","Antenna radiation patterns","Spirals","Surface waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leaky wave antennas","modulation","omnidirectional antennas","planar antennas","spiral antennas","surface impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spiral leaky-wave antennas","modulated surface impedance","spiral planar circularly polarized antennas","cylindrical surface-wave","omnidirectional probe","inhomogeneous surface impedance","impedance modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Leaky-wave antennas","millimeter waves","spiral antennas","surface impedance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spiral Leaky-Wave Antennas Based on Modulated Surface Impedance","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5993513/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388725","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiral Leaky-Wave Antennas Based on Modulated Surface Impedance","sourcePdf":"tap-maci-2165691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062571S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6082719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"193","xplore-issue":"6082719","articleId":"5993513","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5993515,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Two smart LUT updating methods are developed, and least-mean-square adaptation is performed to update the weights and minimize the mean square error between the estimated and desired output.

However, the efficiency of a PUF depends on its implementation cost, its reliability, its resiliency to attacks, and the amount of entropy in it. PUF entropy is used to construct crypto graphic keys, chip identifiers, or challenge-response pairs (CRPs) in a chip authentication mechanism. The amount of entropy in a PUF is limited by the circuit resources available to build a PUF. As a result, generating longer keys or larger sets of CRPs may increase PUF circuit cost. We address this limitation in a PUF by proposing an identity-mapping function that expands the set of CRPs of a ring-oscillator PUF (RO-PUF) with low area cost. The CRPs generated through this function exhibit strong PUF qualities in terms of uniqueness and reliability. To introduce the identity-mapping function, we formulate a novel PUF system model that uncouples PUF measurement from PUF identifier formation.

However, neural networks are black-box models having multiple challenges/difficulties associated with training and generalization. This paper initially looks into the internal behavior of neural networks and develops a detailed interpretation of the neural network functional geometry. Based on this geometrical interpretation, a new set of variables describing neural networks is proposed as a more effective and geometrically interpretable alternative to the traditional set of network weights and biases. Then, this paper develops a new formulation for neural networks with respect to the newly defined variables; this reformulated neural network (ReNN) is equivalent to the common feedforward neural network but has a less complex error response surface. To demonstrate the learning ability of ReNN, in this paper, two training methods involving a derivative-based (a variation of backpropagation) and a derivative-free optimization algorithms are employed. Moreover, a new measure of regularization on the basis of the developed geometrical interpretation is proposed to evaluate and improve the generalization ability of neural networks. The value of the proposed geometrical interpretation, the ReNN approach, and the new regularization measure are demonstrated across multiple test problems. Results show that ReNN can be trained more effectively and efficiently compared to the common neural networks and the proposed regularization measure is an effective indicator of how a network would perform in terms of generalization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12270588","pubMedId":"21859600","volume":"22","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5993545/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Formulation for Feedforward Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Formulation for Feedforward Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-razavi-2163169-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129674S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6032791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6032791","articleId":"5993545","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5993547,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6155180/5993547/5993547-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Qian received the B.S and M.S degrees in electrical engineering at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

The boost converter used in commercial HEVs meets with obstacles when it comes to upgrading the power rating and achieving high efficiency while downsizing the converter. A four-level flying-capacitor dc-dc converter is explored that can overcome these drawbacks by dramatically reducing the inductance requirement. A special case of the four-level converter, the 3X dc-dc converter, operates at three discrete output/input voltage ratios, thus further reducing the inductance requirement to a minimal value (almost zero). When further compared to its switched-capacitor dc-dc converter counterparts, the 3X dc-dc converter can be operated at variable output/input voltage ratios without sacrificing efficiency, and it lowers the capacitance requirement by utilizing the parasitic inductance. The operating principle, current ripple analysis, the transient control to limit the inrush current, and power loss analysis are introduced. Experimental results of a 55-kW prototype are provided to demonstrate the principle and analysis of this topology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/05993547.pdf","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2165559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2165559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"55-kW Variable 3X DC-DC Converter for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Inductors","Batteries","Capacitors","Inductance","Pulse width modulation","Hybrid electric vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","DC-DC power convertors","electric drives","hybrid electric vehicles","invertors","power capacitors","switching convertors","traction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable 3X DC-DC converter","plug-in hybrid electric vehicle traction drive","inverter dc bus","PHEV traction drive","boost converter","power rating","four-level flying-capacitor DC-DC converter","discrete output-nput voltage ratio","switched-capacitor DC-DC converter","variable output-input voltage ratio","parasitic inductance","current ripple analysis","transient control","inrush current","power loss analysis","power 55 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC power conversion","multilevel converter","pulse width modulation","voltage dividers","voltage multipliers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"55-kW Variable 3X DC-DC Converter for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5993547/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543542","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"55-kW Variable 3X DC-DC Converter for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tpel-qian-2165559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062964S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"5993547","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5993552,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Bjornson","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/5993552/5993552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emil Bj\u00f6rnson (S'07) was born in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, in 1983.

Coordinated resource allocation is the key to efficient performance, but the demand on backhaul signaling and computational resources grows rapidly with number of cells, terminals, and subcarriers. To handle this, we propose a novel multicell framework with dynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small set of base stations. Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring terminals only, thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework scalable. This framework can describe anything from interference channels to ideal joint multicell transmission. The resource allocation (i.e., precoding and scheduling) is formulated as an optimization problem (P1) with performance described by arbitrary monotonic functions of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) and arbitrary linear power constraints. Although (P1) is nonconvex and difficult to solve optimally, we are able to prove: 1) optimality of single-stream beamforming; 2) conditions for full power usage; and 3) a precoding parametrization based on a few parameters between zero and one. These optimality properties are used to propose low-complexity strategies: both a centralized scheme and a distributed version that only requires local channel knowledge and processing.

For energy detection, which has the advantage of not requiring knowledge of the signal, the SNR wall is caused by uncertainty in the noise level. Cross-correlation has been suggested as a possible means to obtain higher sensitivity but has received little attention in the context of noise uncertainty. The idea of cross-correlation is to have two receive paths, where each path independently processes the signal before they are combined, such that the noise added to the input signal at the individual paths is largely uncorrelated. In this paper, we mathematically quantify the SNR wall for cross-correlation, showing that it linearly scales with the amount of noise correlation. This lower noise correlation results in higher sensitivity, which is significantly better than that for autocorrelation. Equations that can be used to estimate the benefit over autocorrelation and the measurement time for a required probability of detection and false alarm are derived.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","volume":"60","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"12291113","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993556/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lowering the SNR Wall for Energy Detection Using Cross-Correlation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lowering the SNR Wall for Energy Detection Using Cross-Correlation","sourcePdf":"tvt-oudealink-2165569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094321S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5993556","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5993557,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The BWS is used by a fuzzy logic energy-management system of a plug-in series hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) to make a decision on the power split between the battery and the engine, based on the BWS and vehicle power demand, while controlling the engine to work in its fuel economic region. The fuzzy logic management system was tested in real time using an HEV simulation test bench with a real battery in the loop. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed fuzzy logic energy-management system under different driving conditions and battery SOCs. The results indicate that the fuzzy logic energy-management system using the BWS was effective in ensuring that the engine operates in the vicinity of its maximum fuel efficiency region while preventing the battery from over-discharging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993557/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12291114","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5993557/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy and Battery Management of a Plug-In Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle Using Fuzzy Logic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy and Battery Management of a Plug-In Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle Using Fuzzy Logic","sourcePdf":"tvt-sharkh-2165571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100205S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5993557","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5993590,"authors":[{"name":"Nazim Agoulmine","affiliation":["University of Evry Val d''Essonne (UEVE), France"],"bio":{"p":["Nazim Agoulmine (nazim.agoulmine@iup.univ-evry.fr) is a full professor at the University of Evry, France, and a WCU distinguished visiting professor at POSTECH, Korea.

In this paper, we study the use of multi-level spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) cells in the design of processor caches. Compared to the traditional SRAM caches, a multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM cache design is denser, fast, and consumes less energy. However, a number of critical issues remains to be solved before MLC STT-RAM technology can be deployed in processor caches. In this paper, we shall offer solutions to the issue of bit encoding as well as tackle the write endurance problem. The latter has been neglected in previous works on STT-RAM caches. We propose a set remapping scheme that can potentially prolong the lifetime of a MLC STT-RAM cache by 80\u00d7 on average. Furthermore, a method for recovering the performance that may be lost in some applications due to set remapping is introduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993610/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993610/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12193106","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Processor caches built using multi-level spin-transfer torque RAM cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processor caches built using multi-level spin-transfer torque RAM cells","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"p073chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079314S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981422","isNumber":"5993591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981422","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5993591","articleId":"5993610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5993611,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Jadidi","affiliation":["HPCAN Laboratory, Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Jadidi","id":"38277816100"},{"name":"Mohammad Arjomand","affiliation":["HPCAN Laboratory, Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Arjomand","id":"37400275000"},{"name":"Hamid Sarbazi-Azad","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences, Tehran, Iran","HPCAN Laboratory, Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Sarbazi-Azad","id":"38270047600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-660-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-658-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-659-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5993611","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":856},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993611","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Computer architecture","Radiation detectors","Microprocessors","Indexes","Integrated circuit modeling","Magnetic tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","microprocessor chips","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance-efficient design","hybrid cache architectures","adaptive line replacement","STT-RAM memory","chip multiprocessors","STT-RAM lines","STT-RAM array","dynamic write energy","acceptable write latency","quad-core CMP","PARSEC-2 benchmark","cache power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chip multiprocessors","hybrid cache architecture","spin torque transfer RAM","wear leveling","cache line displacement"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a run-time strategy for managing writes onto last level cache in chip multiprocessors where STT-RAM memory is used as baseline technology. To this end, we assume that each cache set is decomposed into limited SRAM lines and large number of STT-RAM lines. SRAM lines are target of frequently-written data and rarely-written or read-only ones are pushed into STT-RAM. As a novel contribution, a low-overhead, fully-hardware technique is utilized to detect write-intensive data blocks of working set and place them into SRAM lines while the remaining data blocks are candidates to be remapped onto STT-RAM blocks during system operation. Therefore, the achieved cache architecture has large capacity and consumes near zero leakage energy using STT-RAM array; while dynamic write energy, acceptable write latency, and long lifetime is guaranteed via SRAM array. Results of full-system simulation for a quad-core CMP running PARSEC-2 benchmark suit confirm an average of 49 times improvement in cache lifetime and more than 50% reduction in cache power consumption when compared to baseline configurations.","doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2011.5993611","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981422/5993591/05993611.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2011.5993611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-endurance and performance-efficient design of hybrid cache architectures through adaptive line replacement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"High-endurance and performance-efficient design of hybrid cache architectures through adaptive line replacement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12193107","htmlLink":"/document/5993611/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-endurance and performance-efficient design of hybrid cache architectures through adaptive line replacement","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"p079jadidi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091767S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981422","isNumber":"5993591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981422","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5993591","articleId":"5993611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5993623,"authors":[{"name":"Anurag Nigam","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Anurag","lastName":"Nigam","id":"37585962300"},{"name":"Clinton W.

In addition, lowering the supply voltage to reduce power consumption further reduces the read and write margins. To maintain robustness, a new bitcell topology, 8-T bitcell, has been proposed and read where write operation can be separately optimized. However, it can aggravate the half select disturb when write word-line boosting is applied or the bitcell sizing is done to enable robust writability. The half select disturb issue limits the use of a bit-interleaved array configuration required for immunity to soft errors. The opposing characteristic between write operation and half select disturb generates a new constraint which should be carefully considered for robust operation of voltage-scaled bit-interleaved 8-T SRAMs. In this paper, we propose bit-interleaved writability analysis that captures the double-sided constraints placed on the word-line pulse width and voltage level to ensure writability while avoiding half select disturb issue. Using the proposed analysis, we investigate the effectiveness of word-line boosting and device sizing optimization on improving bitcell robustness in low voltage region.

buffer for low power and low voltage operation. The cell features a shared footer device to control the VGND for cell pass-gate (Write) transistors and the Read buffer.

We propose a novel energy management strategy for a combined (hybrid) supply consisting of a battery and a set of supercapacitors to extend the system's lifetime. Batteries are not sufficient for handling high load fluctuations and demands in modern complex systems. Supercapacitors hold promise for complementing battery supplies because they possess higher power density, a larger number of charge/recharge cycles, and less sensitivity to operational conditions. However, supercapacitors are not efficient as a standalone supply because of their comparatively higher leakage and lower energy density. Due to the nonlinearity of the hybrid supply elements, multiplicity of the possible supply states, and the stochastic nature of the workloads, deriving an optimal management policy is a challenge. We pose this problem as a stochastic Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a reinforcement learning method, called Q-learning, to derive an efficient approximation for the optimal management strategy. This method studies a diverse set of workload profiles for a mobile platform and learns the best policy in form of an adaptive approximation approach. Evaluations on measurements collected from mobile phone users show the effectiveness of our proposed method in maximizing the combined energy system's lifetime.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5993641/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12193133","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning to manage combined energy supply systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to manage combined energy supply systems","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"p229mirhoseini.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081742S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981422","isNumber":"5993591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981422","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5993591","articleId":"5993641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5993651,"authors":[{"name":"Makoto Yabuuchi","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Yabuuchi","id":"37300191200"},{"name":"Yasumasa Tsukamoto","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasumasa","lastName":"Tsukamoto","id":"37287308000"},{"name":"Hidehiro Fujiwara","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidehiro","lastName":"Fujiwara","id":"37532906000"},{"name":"Shigeki Tawa","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeki","lastName":"Tawa","id":"37951507500"},{"name":"Koji Maekawa","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Maekawa","id":"37950211000"},{"name":"Motoshige Igarashi","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoshige","lastName":"Igarashi","id":"37265662000"},{"name":"Koji Nii","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Nii","id":"37300187800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-660-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-658-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-659-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5993651","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":336},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993651","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Random access memory","Layout","Substrates","Logic gates","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit noise","MOSFET","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic body-biased SRAM","asymmetric halo implant MOSFET","static noise margin","SRAM write margin","CMOS technology","SoC","voltage 0.5 V","size 45 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","variation","asymmetric MOSFET","dynamic body-bias"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2011.5993651","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981422/5993591/05993651.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2011.5993651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic body-biased SRAM with asymmetric halo implant MOSFETs","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an SRAM macro that realizes 0.5V operation by combining a device technique with simple design architecture.

Showing measured data fabricated on 45nm CMOS technology, we demonstrate a plausible scenario for achieving 0.5V operating SoC products.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5993651/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12193143","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic body-biased SRAM with asymmetric halo implant MOSFETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic body-biased SRAM with asymmetric halo implant MOSFETs","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"p285yabuuchi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054228S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981422","isNumber":"5993591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981422","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5993591","articleId":"5993651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5993652,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Hung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, and Microelectronics and Information System Research Center (MIRC), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Hung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37536194400"},{"name":"Yi-Te Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, and Microelectronics and Information System Research Center (MIRC), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Te","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37963970800"},{"name":"Shu-Lin Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, and Microelectronics and Information System Research Center (MIRC), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Lin","lastName":"Lai","id":"37953829900"},{"name":"Wei Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, and Microelectronics and Information System Research Center (MIRC), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37285310100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-660-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-658-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-659-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5993652","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1033},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Transistors","Delay","Reliability","Arrays","Error correction codes","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit stability","CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","leakage currents","logic gates","low-power electronics","power aware computing","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subthreshold SRAM","bit-interleaving scheme","power consumption reduction","energy constrained SoC design","ultra-low power consideration","SRAM stability","SRAM reliability","positive feedback loop","inverter pair","storage node","read SNM","virtual ground","bit-line leakage","1P10M CMOS technology","size 65 nm","voltage 0.3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultra-low power","subthreshold SRAM","bit-interleaving scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993652","abstract":"Subthreshold SRAM is a significant approach to reduce power consumption in energy-constrained SoC design. For the ultra-low power consideration, the primary concerns of SRAM are stability and reliability instead of performance. In this paper, the proposed 9T bit-cell enhances write ability by cutting off the positive feedback loop of inverter pair. In the read mode, the isolated read path and storage node enlarge the read SNM. Besides, a 9T subthreshold SRAM is proposed to enable implementation of bit-interleaving structure which achieves soft-error tolerance. The proposed SRAM is able to operate at a voltage as low as 0.3V. One extra virtual ground (VVSS) line is used to reduce the bit-line leakage to ensure the data can be read successfully. A 1kb bit-interleaved 9T SRAM is implemented in UMC 65nm 1P10M CMOS technology to verify the proposed scheme, which operates at the minimum energy point (0.3V) with 5.824pJ energy consumption for one write and one read operation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993591","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981422/5993591/05993652.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2011.5993652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISLPED.2011.5993652","startPage":"291","endPage":"296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1kb 9T subthreshold SRAM with bit-interleaving scheme in 65nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993652/","displayDocTitle":"A 1kb 9T subthreshold SRAM with bit-interleaving scheme in 65nm CMOS","htmlLink":"/document/5993652/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12193144","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1kb 9T subthreshold SRAM with bit-interleaving scheme in 65nm CMOS","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"p291chang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073058S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981422","isNumber":"5993591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981422","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5993591","articleId":"5993652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5993653,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph F.

the increased bandwidth and reduced wire-length enabled by through-silicon-via structures (TSVs). Traditionally TSVs have been considered to improve the thermal conductivity in the vertical direction. However, the lateral thermal blockage effect becomes increasingly important for TSV via farms (a cluster of TSV vias used for signal bus connections between layers). TSV farms can cause different thermal effects on different layers due to the unequal x, y, z thermal conductivities. This can exhibit itself as thermal improvement in the vertical heat flow, at the same time lateral heat blockage effects in thinned pass-through layers. In this paper, we propose a thermal-aware via farm placement technique for 3D ICs to minimize lateral heat blockages caused by dense signal bus TSV structures. By incorporating thermal conductivity profile of via farm blocks in the design flow and enabling placement/aspect ratio optimization, the corresponding hotspots can be minimized within the wire-length and area constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ISLPED.2011.5993673","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM International

requirement for portable multimedia devices employing various signal processing algorithms and architectures. In most multimedia applications, the final output is interpreted by human senses, which are not perfect. This fact obviates the need to produce exactly correct numerical outputs. Previous research in this context exploits error-resiliency primarily through voltage over-scaling, utilizing algorithmic and architectural techniques to mitigate the resulting errors. In this paper, we propose logic complexity reduction as an alternative approach to take advantage of the relaxation of numerical accuracy. We demonstrate this concept by proposing various imprecise or approximate Full Adder (FA) cells with reduced complexity at the transistor level, and utilize them to design approximate multi-bit adders. In addition to the inherent reduction in switched capacitance, our techniques result in significantly shorter critical paths, enabling voltage scaling. We design architectures for video and image compression algorithms using the proposed approximate arithmetic units, and evaluate them to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Post-layout simulations indicate power savings of up to 60% and area savings of up to 37% with an insignificant loss in output quality, when compared to existing implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993675/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12193167","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5993675/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"IMPACT: IMPrecise adders for low-power approximate computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IMPACT: IMPrecise adders for low-power approximate computing","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"p409gupta.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078603S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981422","isNumber":"5993591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981422","citationCount":"240","xplore-issue":"5993591","articleId":"5993675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5993685,"authors":[{"name":"Munam A.

Cognitive Radio Technology which is an opportunistic network and is equipped with fully programmable wireless devices that empowers the network by OODA cycle and then make intelligent decisions by adapting their MAC and physical layer characteristics such as waveform, has appeared to be the only solution for current low spectrum availability and under utilization problem. In this paper a novel Dynamic De-Centralized Hybrid \u201cDDH-MAC\u201d protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks has been presented which lies between Global Common Control Channel (GCCC) and non-GCCC categories of cognitive radio MAC protocols. DDH-MAC is equipped with the best features of GCCC MAC protocols but also overcomes the saturation and security issues in GCCC. To the best of authors' knowledge, DDH-MAC is the first protocol which is hybrid between GCCC and non-GCCC family of protocols. DDH-MAC provides multiple levels of security and partially use GCCC to transmit beacon which sets and announces local control channel for exchange of free channel list (FCL) sensed by the co-operatively communicating cognitive radio nodes, subsequently providing secure transactions among participating nodes over the decided local control channel. This paper describes the framework of the DDH-MAC protocol in addition to its pseudo code for implementation; it is shown that the pre-transmission time for DDH-MAC is on average 20% better while compared to other cognitive radio MAC protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12193966","htmlLink":"/document/5993685/","conferenceDate":"23-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"DDH-MAC: A novel Dynamic De-Centralized Hybrid MAC protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DDH-MAC: A novel Dynamic De-Centralized Hybrid MAC protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"NAT70PID1977171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069984S","chronDate":"23-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983339","isNumber":"5993676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983339","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5993676","articleId":"5993685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5993691,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

In this paper, we present most common architectural countermeasures against natural or malicious fault injections, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and giving a few nontrivial considerations.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993825","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979170/5993790/05993825.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Countermeasures against fault attacks: The good, the bad, and the ugly","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Countermeasures against fault attacks: The good, the bad, and the ugly","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192540","htmlLink":"/document/5993825/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Countermeasures against fault attacks: The good, the bad, and the ugly","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp25S22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059297S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979170","isNumber":"5993790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979170","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5993790","articleId":"5993825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5993827,"authors":[{"name":"Yuriy Shiyanovskii","affiliation":["Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Shiyanovskii","id":"37546081400"},{"name":"Aravind Rajendran","affiliation":["Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Aravind","lastName":"Rajendran","id":"37546081700"},{"name":"Chris Papachristou","affiliation":["Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Papachristou","id":"37265464000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1056-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1053-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1055-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"5993827","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Random access memory","Capacitors","Stability analysis","Power demand","Circuit stability","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit stability","CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","nanoelectronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation tolerant SRAM design","synergetic functional component separation","nanoscale CMOS","power consumption","radiation tolerance level","size 32 nm"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel SRAM design for nanoscale CMOS. The new design addresses the problem of low radiation tolerance and high instability for SRAM memories at feature size of 32 nm.

The design consists of three different components: the first component is used to store the data, the second one is designed to protect the data at the most vulnerable state and last component serves to extract the data from the SRAM cell. We performed comparative analysis of our design against conventional radiation-tolerant designs in terms of power consumption, level of radiation tolerance, performance, area and stability. The benefits of our new design (high radiation tolerance, high stability, fast performance) were confirmed by extensive simulations in different 32 nm technology environments (low power, high performance, bulk).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel radiation tolerant SRAM design based on synergetic functional component separation for nanoscale CMOS","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993827","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993790","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979170/5993790/05993827.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A novel radiation tolerant SRAM design based on synergetic functional component separation for nanoscale CMOS","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993827/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192542","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel radiation tolerant SRAM design based on synergetic functional component separation for nanoscale CMOS","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp27P54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064664S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979170","isNumber":"5993790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979170","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5993790","articleId":"5993827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5993829,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Because bitlines along unselected columns are not activated, the divided wordline structure eliminates a half-select problem and achieves low-power operation, which is often preferred for low-power / low-voltage applications. However, the conventional 8T SRAM with the divided wordline structure engenders MBUs because all bits in the same word are physically adjoining. Consequently, error correction coding (ECC) techniques are difficult to apply. This paper presents a new 8T cell layout pattern that separates internal latches in SRAM cells using both an n-well and a p-substrate. We investigated an SEU cross section of nMOS that is 3.5-4.5 times higher than that of pMOS. Using an iRoC TFIT simulator, we confirmed that the proposed 8T cell has better neutron-induced MBU tolerance. The MBU in the proposed 8T SRAM is improved by 90.70% and the MBU soft error rate (SER) is decreased to 3.46 FIT at 0.9 V when ECC is implemented. Additionally, we conducted Synopsys 3-D TCAD simulation, which indicates that the LET threshold (LETth) in single-event upset (SEU) is also improved by 66.47% in the proposed 8T SRAM by a common-mode effect.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993829","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979170/5993790/05993829.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-bit-upset and single-bit-upset resilient 8T SRAM bitcell layout with divided wordline structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-bit-upset and single-bit-upset resilient 8T SRAM bitcell layout with divided wordline structure","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12192544","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5993829/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-bit-upset and single-bit-upset resilient 8T SRAM bitcell layout with divided wordline structure","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp29P68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062848S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979170","isNumber":"5993790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979170","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5993790","articleId":"5993829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5993833,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Alexandrescu","affiliation":["iRoC Technologies, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Alexandrescu","id":"37543120000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1056-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1053-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1055-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"5993833","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993833","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Error analysis","Neutrons","Reliability","Single event upset","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","error analysis","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comprehensive soft error analysis methodology","SoC-ASIC memory instances","soft error rate analysis","single event effects","multiple bit upsets","SECDED codes","SER analysis","high-level functional failure estimation","SRAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single Event Upsets","Soft Errors","Soft Error Rate","Memory SER","SER De-rating","data lifetime"]}],"abstract":"Memory blocks are important features of any design, in terms of functionality, silicon area and reliability. Embedded SRAM instances are critical contributors to the overall Soft Error Rate of the system, requiring a careful consideration of the reliability aspects and adequate sizing of the error mitigation capabilities. While error detecting and correcting codes are widely available and particularly effective against most types of Single Event Effects, Multiple Bit Upsets and progressive errors accumulation may defeat the error correction capabilities of standard SECDED codes. Accordingly, the paper presents an overall approach to the structural and functional SER analysis of the memory instances in addition to error mitigation efficiency estimation. Moreover, intrinsic, nominal, SER figures are not a realistic indicator of the memory behavior for a given application. We propose instead, an opportunity window metric, associated to the notion of data lifetime in the memory, as extracted from functional simulations. Lastly, based on the opportunity window figures, targeted and efficient fault simulation campaigns can be prepared to estimate high-level functional failures induced by Single Events. The overall memory SER evaluation aims at assisting the designers to improve the performances of the design and to document the reliability figures of the system.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993833","startPage":"175","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979170/5993790/05993833.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993833","endPage":"176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comprehensive soft error analysis methodology for SoCs/ASICs memory instances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive soft error analysis methodology for SoCs/ASICs memory instances","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993833/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12192548","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive soft error analysis methodology for SoCs/ASICs memory instances","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp33P40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039084S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979170","isNumber":"5993790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979170","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5993790","articleId":"5993833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5993835,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Vaskova","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group Electronic Technology Department, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Vaskova","id":"38270333900"},{"name":"Celia L\u00f3pez-Ongil","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group Electronic Technology Department, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Celia","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-Ongil","id":"38270850800"},{"name":"Enrique San Mill\u00e1n","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group Electronic Technology Department, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique San","lastName":"Mill\u00e1n","id":"37369096400"},{"name":"Alejandro Jim\u00e9nez-Horas","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group Electronic Technology Department, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Jim\u00e9nez-Horas","id":"38272817800"},{"name":"Luis Entrena","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group Electronic Technology Department, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Entrena","id":"37300332100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1056-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1053-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1055-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"5993835","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"abstract":"Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are used frequently in secure data processing algorithms.

While the framework is applicable to arbitrary software, we demonstrate its usage by characterizing soft errors effects on several software filters used in aviation for probabilistic sensor data fusion.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993836","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979170/5993790/05993836.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based framework for run-time injection and analysis of soft errors in microprocessors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993836/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based framework for run-time injection and analysis of soft errors in microprocessors","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993836/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192551","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based framework for run-time injection and analysis of soft errors in microprocessors","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp36P67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074972S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979170","isNumber":"5993790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979170","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5993790","articleId":"5993836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5993842,"authors":[{"name":"Valentin Gherman","affiliation":["LIST, Embedded Systems Reliability Laboratory, CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Gherman","id":"37423233600"},{"name":"Samuel Evain","affiliation":["LIST, Embedded Systems Reliability Laboratory, CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Evain","id":"37294985200"},{"name":"Nathaniel Seymour","affiliation":["LIST, Embedded Systems Reliability Laboratory, CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Nathaniel","lastName":"Seymour","id":"37937216100"},{"name":"Yannick Bonhomme","affiliation":["LIST, Embedded Systems Reliability Laboratory, CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Bonhomme","id":"37532904900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1056-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1053-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1055-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"5993842","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized parity-check matrices for SEC-DED codes with fixed parity","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979170/5993790/05993842.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993790","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5993842","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Hardware","Testing","Systematics","Error correction","Block codes","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error correction codes","error detection codes","Hamming codes","linear codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SEC-DED codes","Hamming parity-check matrices","linear block codes","single error correction-double error detection code","Hsiao parity-check matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SEC-DED code","parity-check matrix"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993842","abstract":"Hsiao and extended Hamming parity-check matrices can be used to define systematic linear block codes for Single Error Correction-Double Error Detection (SEC-DED).

It is unrealistic to adopt traditional deterministic load flow calculation for system operation. What is more, load flow in some transmission lines may be increased to a level where a random event could cause the network collapse. A method of combined cumulants and Gram-Charlier expansion (CCGCE) to calculate probabilistic load flow distribution and a research on relieving transmission congestion by FACTS are proposed in this paper. On the basis of a thorough analysis of the international and domestic researches, this thesis firstly introduces mathematical models, including wind power, FACTS and system models. There are two typical FACTS instruments. One is the SVC, modeled with two ideal switched elements in parallel: a capacitance and an inductance. The other is the TCSC, modeled with three ideal switched elements in parallel: a capacitance, an inductance and a simple wire, which permits the value zero. Secondly, it discusses the procedures of Genetic Algorithm, which includes forming initial population, defining fitness function, and application of crossover, mutation and so on. Thirdly, it carries out two simulations. The first simulation demonstrates the accuracy and computational efficiency of CCGCE method by comparing to Monte Carlo method. The second simulation is composed of two parts. The first part is to find out the appropriate location and capacity of FACTS, and the second part is to check the congestion relieving after the installment of FACTS by CCGCE method. Finally, it suggests that the CCGCE method can significantly reduce the computational time, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy on probabilistic load flow calculation, and concludes that after the installment of FACTS, the transmission congestion of power system containing wind farms can be relieved well.","doi":"10.1109/DRPT.2011.5993871","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981576/5993852/05993871.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRPT.2011.5993871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on transmission congestion of power system containing wind farms based on genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Wind power generation","Wind speed","Thyristors","Static VAr compensators","Power capacitors","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","flexible AC transmission systems","genetic algorithms","higher order statistics","inductance","load flow","power capacitors","power transmission lines","probability","static VAr compensators","thyristor applications","wind power","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system","transmission congestion","wind farms","genetic algorithm","large-scale wind power integration","deterministic load flow calculation","transmission lines","network collapse","combined cumulants and Gram-Charlier expansion","probabilistic load flow distribution","mathematical model","FACTS instruments","SVC","capacitance","inductance","TCSC","fitness function","CCGCE method","static Var compensator","thyristor controlled series capacitor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wind power integration","transmission congestion","FACTS","probabilistic load flow calculation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Research on transmission congestion of power system containing wind farms based on genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993871/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12193419","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on transmission congestion of power system containing wind farms based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"019463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060914S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981576","isNumber":"5993852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981576","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5993852","articleId":"5993871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5993881,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Shi","affiliation":["North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5981576/5993852/5993881/5993881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Shi received the B.S.

However, the uncertainty of wind power and intermittence of wind energy are the main factors which affect forecasting precision. The wind power output data can be treated as a signal stream which has characteristics for possible wind capacity forecasting. Hilbert-Huang Transforms (HHT) and Hilbert spectral analysis have been applied extensively to analysis nonlinear and non-stationary stochastic signal. The time series of wind power output has been transformed into certain signals with different frequencies. Each signal is taken as input data joining with wind speed data to establish Artificial Neural Network (ANN) forecasting model. The models are combined together to obtain the final results on potential wind power output. This paper proposes HHT-ANN model for wind power forecasting. A case study of a wind farm in Texas, U.S shows that the MRE of proposed method is lower than the traditional ANN approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993881/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12193428","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993881/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short term wind power forecasting using Hilbert-Huang Transform and artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short term wind power forecasting using Hilbert-Huang Transform and artificial neural network","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"029122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048586S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981576","isNumber":"5993852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981576","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5993852","articleId":"5993881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5993882,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Chieh Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Chieh","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37329604300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0365-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0364-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0363-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5993882","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Companies","Acceleration","Programming","Particle swarm optimization","Resource management","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","load flow","particle swarm optimisation","power distribution planning","power generation planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution systems","particle swarm optimization","compromise programming","distribution networks","distribution load flows","bi-objective planning","8-bus radial distribution network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed generation","particle swarm optimization","compromise Programming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993882","abstract":"DG technology is penetrating the distribution networks continuously and changing the patterns of distribution load flows and system operations.

The ratios of the electrical damping to the Unit Interaction Factor (UIF) and other two specific constants, which are part of UIF, don't change significantly. The two constants can be used to indicate characteristics of the electrical damping and represent the \u2018shaft to converter station\u2019 electrical damping transfer characteristic.

The simulation model is also built and the results show that the harmonic components can be detected at real time with high precision.","doi":"10.1109/DRPT.2011.5993958","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981576/5993852/05993958.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRPT.2011.5993958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic analysis approach based on wavelet transform and neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5993958/","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic analysis approach based on wavelet transform and neural network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12193504","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5993958/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic analysis approach based on wavelet transform and neural network","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"106337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056237S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981576","isNumber":"5993852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981576","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5993852","articleId":"5993958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5993964,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power System Simulation and Control of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292561700"},{"name":"Huilan Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power System Simulation and Control of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Huilan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272623600"},{"name":"Ke Xu","affiliation":["Tianjin Electric Power Corporation Technology Center, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Xu","id":"37957171500"},{"name":"Guodong Li","affiliation":["Tianjin Electric Power Corporation Technology Center, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Li","id":"37963923700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0365-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0364-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0363-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5993964","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1762},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5993964","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Mathematical model","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","reactive power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system reactive power optimization","particle swarm optimization","reactive power regulation","IEEE 14-bus system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power System","Reactive Power Optimization","Artificial Intelligence Algorithms","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DRPT.2011.5993964","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981576/5993852/05993964.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","startPage":"606","endPage":"609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRPT.2011.5993964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive power optimization of power system based on improved particle swarm optimization","abstract":"Reactive power optimization is a nonlinear, multivariable, multi-constrained programming problem, which makes the optimization process complicated.

Firstly, original wind speed seires is decomposed into one low-frequency component and several high-frequency components by wavelet decomposition method. Then different LMBP neural networks are built for the forecasting of every component respectively. Finally the predictions of components are reconstructed to obtain the prediction of original wind speed. As for the problem that the convergence rate is limited by the inversion calculation of large-scale matrix in the training process of LMBP network, super-memory gradient algorithm solving large linear equations is introduced to adjust weights and thresholds of the network. Meanwhile the structure of hidden layer neurons is optimized by least squares network pruning method. At the end of the paper, actual wind speed data from certain wind farm is used to verify the forecasting model and the results indicate that the model develops the precision of wind speed forecasting effectively.","doi":"10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994064","startPage":"1126","endPage":"1131","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993852","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981576/5993852/05994064.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term forecasting for wind speed based on wavelet decomposition and LMBP neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994064/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-term forecasting for wind speed based on wavelet decomposition and LMBP neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994064/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12193609","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term forecasting for wind speed based on wavelet decomposition and LMBP neural network","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"212451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064999S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981576","isNumber":"5993852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981576","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5993852","articleId":"5994064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5994067,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Zhong","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5981576/5993852/5994067/5994067-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing Zhong, received Ph.

For automatic computing resource assignments, the interesting idea of subgraph isomorphism is proposed. Computing units (racks) are connected with communication wires, whereas the power grid is connected with electrical lines. The two systems can be taken as two graphs with physical correspondence. To assign the computing resources is to find a relationship of subgraph isomorphism between two graphs. Genetic algorithm is applied to solve the problem.

However, in this transformation process many human factors will inevitably be mixed into it to some extent and conflicting goals are often hard to reconcile, so that the solution which satisfies the single objective is easy to fall into local optimum and hard to achieve balance between the original objectives. In this paper, application of Pareto multi-objective genetic algorithm, which has rised in recent years, in transmission network expansion planning is proposed so as to reconcile the conflicting goals in transmission network expansion planning. With the advantage of this algorithm the \"N-1\" security criteria is considered as one of the objectives in the form of the penalty function to meet with the high reliability requirements of transmission network. In addition, the elites saving strategy is introduced into the multi-objective genetic algorithm in this paper to not only avoid the loss of outstanding individuals but also improve the convergence speed. Furthermore, to reduce the number of iterations and improve computational efficiency, fault ordering method is successfully adopted in \"N-1\" security check. Finally, IEEE Garver-6 system is simulated and the results reveal that the solution can be acquired in one step optimization and satisfy the\u201cN-1\u201dsecurity criterion of transmission network when \u201cN-1\u201dis taken into account as an objective; and the Pareto multi-objective genetic algorithm in this paper can provide the optimal solution based on balanced multiple objectives compared to traditonal single objective genetic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994087","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981576/5993852/05994087.pdf","startPage":"1250","endPage":"1254","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission network planning with N-1 security criterion based on improved multi-objective genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Transmission network planning with N-1 security criterion based on improved multi-objective genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12193630","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5994087/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission network planning with N-1 security criterion based on improved multi-objective genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"235207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056079S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981576","isNumber":"5993852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981576","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5993852","articleId":"5994087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5994098,"authors":[{"name":"Meisam Hajizadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Meisam","lastName":"Hajizadeh","id":"37967319600"},{"name":"Javad Sadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Sadeh","id":"37448450000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0365-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0364-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0363-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5994098","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Damping","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Power capacitors","Thyristors","Oscillators","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","IEEE standards","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FACTS","genetic algorithm","multimachine power system","flexible ac transmission system","PSS","power system stabilizer","objective function","IEEE 14 bus","transmission line"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSS","TCSC","Coordination","Tuning","GA","Damping"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994098","abstract":"In this paper is tried to coordinate and regulate the flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) and power system stabilizer (PSS) to increase damping in multi-machine power systems.

The local modes can be damp by using PSS but inter area mode should be damp by using FACTS devices. Tuning and coordination together for several parameters is a complex work and we can not consider all conditions and limitations thus we have to use a global search algorithm to find the best solution. We have used modal analysis to improve damping. Damping ratio has been selected as the objective function. The loads have been modeled as constant impedance.

Finally making use of GA and poles placement the damping of LFO is converted into the design and parameter coordination of MBPSS. Because identified models consider influence of other machines and the control goal avoids decreasing damping of other modes in excess, the coordination of controllers is realized.

multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization method of a grid-parallel Microgrid (MG) is presented aiming for more comprehensive and accurate assessment of a grid-parallel MG. First, different operational modes of a grid-parallel MG are analyzed and sorted. Normally, the MG will connect with the energy deliver system most of the time, providing functions such as peak shaving, system reserve. But it is also required to operate separately from the grid in planned or unplanned island mode due to different reasons, e.g., power outage, abnormal weather. Then, a multi-objective optimization method to size MG based on different operational scenarios study is proposed. The objectives consist of MG construction and operation cost, reliability cost, ancillary values, utilization of renewable energy and emission. An improved customer outage cost analysis method is demonstrated taking power outage reasons and reliability requirement of load into consideration. A demonstration MG considered in this paper consists of PV, wind turbine (WT), diesel generator, converter and battery energy storage. The results prove that the method presented is sound and effective.","doi":"10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994160","startPage":"1638","endPage":"1646","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993852","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981576/5993852/05994160.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization of grid-parallel Microgrid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994160/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization of grid-parallel Microgrid","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994160/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12193699","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-scenario, multi-objective optimization of grid-parallel Microgrid","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"308322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067631S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981576","isNumber":"5993852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981576","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5993852","articleId":"5994160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5994206,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaomei Wu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","School of Electrical Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaomei WU received her B.Eng and M.Sc. degrees from Power Engineering Department, Northeast China Institute of Electric Power Engineering, Jilin, China, in 1993 and 1997, respectively, and the M.Eng. degree from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, 2004.

The Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, owing to its superior performance of linear/nonlinear algorithm with respect to fast convergence and accurate prediction, is very suitable for wind power forecasting. Based on the historical data from a wind farm composed of wind speed, environmental temperature, and power generation, the authors develop a short-term wind power prediction model for one-hour-ahead forecasting using a RBF neural network. Due to the existence of incorrect values in the original data, the Grubbs test is conducted to preprocess the samples. In the case study, the forecasting results are compared with the actual wind power outputs. The simulation shows that the presented method could provide accurate and stable forecasting.","doi":"10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994206","startPage":"1879","endPage":"1882","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993852","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981576/5993852/05994206.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radial basis function neural network based short-term wind power forecasting with Grubbs test","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994206/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Radial basis function neural network based short-term wind power forecasting with Grubbs test","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994206/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12193742","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radial basis function neural network based short-term wind power forecasting with Grubbs test","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"354173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059109S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981576","isNumber":"5993852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981576","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5993852","articleId":"5994206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5994225,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Ali Charaniya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, B.N.College of Engg, Pusad., India"],"lastName":"Nizar Ali Charaniya","id":"37946616200"},{"name":"Sanjay V.

Prediction of rainfall pattern remains a difficult problem and the desired level of accuracy has not been reached. In this paper, a committee of artificial neural networks (ANNs) based model with wavelet decomposition is proposed for prediction of monthly rainfall on accounts of the preceding events of rainfall data. Wavelet transform is used for extraction of approximate and detail coefficient of the rainfall data series. These coefficients are used along with a ANN for learning and knowledge extraction processes. The model has been tested on rainfall data for different geographical region of India and also for entire country. The proposed model is capable of forecasting monthly rainfall one month in advance.","doi":"10.1109/ICBEIA.2011.5994225","pdfPath":"/iel5/5980192/5994212/05994225.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"129","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Business, Engineering and Industrial Applications","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Business, Engineering and Industrial Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBEIA.2011.5994225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5994212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Committee of artificial neural networks for monthly rainfall prediction using wavelet transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Committee of artificial neural networks for monthly rainfall prediction using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12192581","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5994225/","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Committee of artificial neural networks for monthly rainfall prediction using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p125charaniya.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063368S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5980192","isNumber":"5994212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5980192","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5994212","articleId":"5994225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5994292,"authors":[{"name":"Yukihiro Tadokoro","affiliation":["TOYOTA CENTRAL R&D LABS., INC., Aichi-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiro","lastName":"Tadokoro","id":"37270511500"},{"name":"Akihisa Ichiki","affiliation":["TOYOTA CENTRAL R&D LABS., INC., Aichi-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihisa","lastName":"Ichiki","id":"37946581100"},{"name":"Masaki Takanashi","affiliation":["TOYOTA CENTRAL R&D LABS., INC., Aichi-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Takanashi","id":"37402663400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0192-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0189-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0191-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5994292","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994292","doi":"10.1109/ICNF.2011.5994292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNF.2011.5994292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5994268","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Noise and Fluctuations","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Noise and Fluctuations","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981431/5994268/05994292.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sampling frequency and observation time analysis for efficient stochastic resonance in digital signal processing","abstract":"The noise-related phenomenon, stochastic resonance (SR), may improve the performance of signal detection devices.

Optical link employs laser, optical fiber and optical detector to transmit RF signal. RoF has an ability to carry signals for tens of kilometers, but this transmission is limited by optical impairments such as laser nonlinearity, fiber dispersion, and optical detector noises. In this paper, we study the effects of multimode fiber core refractive index profile, optical detector noises and atmospheric instability on the achievable performance of an OFDM based RoF link. The optical-signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and cumulative signal-to-noise ratio (SNRc) are used to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed scheme for a low-cost, reliable, robust, and high data rate fiber-wireless link. Thereafter, numerical results are generated for the downlink to illustrate the performance of the OFDM based RoF system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Noise and Fluctuations","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981431/5994268/05994356.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"2011 21st International Conference on Noise and Fluctuations","doi":"10.1109/ICNF.2011.5994356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNF.2011.5994356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5994268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of optical impairments in OFDM based radio-over-fiber communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical noise","Optical receivers","Optical variables control","Optical refraction","Signal to noise ratio","Optical distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical impairments","radio-over-fiber communication systems","radio-over-fiber technology","RoF technology","optical link","optical detector","optical fiber","laser nonlinearity","fiber dispersion","optical detector noises","optical-signal-to-noise ratio","OSNR","OFDM based RoF system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","radio-over-fiber","optical signal-tonoise ratio","cumulative signal-to-noise ratio","optical fiber dispersion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of optical impairments in OFDM based radio-over-fiber communication systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12193251","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"12-16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of optical impairments in OFDM based radio-over-fiber communication systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p409khan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047526S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981431","isNumber":"5994268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981431","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5994268","articleId":"5994356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5994373,"authors":[{"name":"Rakesh Jeyasingh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Jeyasingh","id":"37586266500"},{"name":"J.A.

STT-MRAM possesses desirable memory attributes such as excellent readability, writability, stability, non-volatility, and unlimited endurance. Moreover, ITRS reports that STT-MRAM can endure 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">15</sup>\n cycle operations before breakdown thus meeting 10 yrs life-time. As shown in Fig. 1, STT-MRAM bitcell consists of one access transistor and one magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) (1T-1R). One of the primary reliability concerns in STT-MRAM is the dielectric breakdown of the tunnel junction MgO in the MTJ known as time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB). The thickness of MgO is on the order of 1nm and the voltage across the MTJ during write operation is approximately 0.7V resulting in electric field of ~10MV/cm across it which can induce TDDB. Thus, such high stress conditions can lead to lower breakdown time (T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BD</sub>\n) which can go even lower with further MgO thickness scaling. In addition to the hard breakdown (HBD) in MTJ which results in very low MTJ impedance and inability to function as memory, experimental results show that soft breakdowns (SBD) also exists. SBDs cause minor degradation in the MTJ resistance and they have shorter average time to appear compared to HBDs. In this paper, we explore in detail the physical mechanism behind both HBD and SBD, and using percolation model we estimate the time dependent degradation in the MTJ performance parameters such as tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR), write current (J\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</sub>\n), write-time (T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">WR</sub>\n) and lifetime (T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LIFE</sub>\n).","doi":"10.1109/DRC.2011.5994447","publicationTitle":"69th Device Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"69th Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981430/5994397/05994447.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5994397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRC.2011.5994447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of dielectric breakdown-induced time-dependent STT-MRAM performance degradation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of dielectric breakdown-induced time-dependent STT-MRAM performance degradation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994447/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12222083","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994447/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of dielectric breakdown-induced time-dependent STT-MRAM performance degradation","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"III38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050235S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981430","isNumber":"5994397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981430","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5994397","articleId":"5994447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5994466,"authors":[{"name":"Niladri N.

These devices can be electrically switched between a high-resistance state (HRS, or OFF-state) and a low-resistance state (LRS, or ON-state). The switching from HRS to LRS is called SET and that from LRS to HRS is RESET. Resistive switching may be bipolar (i.e., SET and RESET in opposite bias directions) or unipolar (i.e., SET and RESET in the same bias direction). Unipolar resistive switching devices are more compatible with two-terminal selection devices (e.g., diodes) for 3D stackable crossbar arrays. Although the resistive switching mechanisms are not yet clearly understood, it is generally believed that the switching is caused by mixed ionic/electronic effects involving some defects (e.g., mobile ions, charge traps, oxygen vacancies, etc). The RESET in bipolar resistive switching can be explained by the reversal of the physical process that causes SET. For example, the reverse migration of ions/vacancies during RESET may annihilate the conductive channels formed during SET. Since no such reversal exists in unipolar resistive switching, the RESET process in unipolar switching is often explained by thermal effects. The similarity between SET and RESET operation conditions in unipolar switching devices may cause competition between SET and RESET processes, which reflects as instability in the switching characteristics. This paper presents some experimental evidences supporting the hypothesis of power-induced thermal nature of RESET and analyzes the instability associated with the SET-RESET competition in unipolar resistive switching, using data measured on Cu\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nO-based resistive switching devices.","doi":"10.1109/DRC.2011.5994473","displayPublicationTitle":"69th Device Research Conference","startPage":"167","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"69th Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981430/5994397/05994473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRC.2011.5994473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5994397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal effects and instability in unipolar resistive switching devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOS memory circuits","switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal effects","unipolar resistive switching devices","metal oxide based resistive switching devices","next-generation nonvolatile memory applications","two-terminal selection devices","3D stackable crossbar arrays","conductive channels","Cu2O-based resistive switching devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Thermal effects and instability in unipolar resistive switching devices","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12222106","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5994473/","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994473/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal effects and instability in unipolar resistive switching devices","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IVA6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07085S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981430","isNumber":"5994397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981430","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5994397","articleId":"5994473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5994495,"authors":[{"name":"P.

If the tricky growth conditions of this binary can be controlled, AlN/GaN HEMTs promise breakthrough performances, superior to any other III-V nitride-based heterostructure [1]. In particular, this structure should allow the extension of the GaN-based frequency operation due to the possibility to significantly reduce the gate length while maintaining an appropriate gate-to-channel aspect ratio to mitigate short channel effects. However, gate leakage current remains a serious issue with such ultrathin barrier heterostructure and gate dielectrics that often leads to device instability are generally used to overcome this problem. Furthermore, there is an increasing interest in the growth of GaN-on-Si substrates because of its low cost, large size, good thermal conductivity and the potential for integration with Si-based devices. In this work, we developed a novel AlN/GaN HEMT technology on Si substrate. The highest GaN-on-Si drain current density as well as a record transconductance together with excellent RF performance have been achieved. Additionally, AlN/GaN HEMT power measurements at 18 GHz have been performed for the first time. These results show the outstanding potential of this structure to extend GaN-on-Si performances to millimeter wave applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994506/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12222125","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994506/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"First AlN/GaN HEMTs power measurement at 18 GHz on Silicon substrate","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First AlN/GaN HEMTs power measurement at 18 GHz on Silicon substrate","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"VB5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047032S","chronDate":"20-22 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981430","isNumber":"5994397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981430","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5994397","articleId":"5994506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5994532,"authors":[{"name":"M.

All previous countermeasures against fault injection attacks based on error detecting codes assume that the attacker cannot simultaneously control the fault-free outputs of a device-under-attack and error patterns. For advanced attackers who are able to control both of the above two aspects, traditional protections can be easily compromised. In this paper, we propose optimal algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) codes based on the nonlinear encoding functions and the random number generators. The proposed codes can provide a guaranteed high error detecting probability even if the attacker can fully control the fault-free outputs of a device-under-attack as well as the error patterns. As a case study, we present the protection architectures based on AMD codes for multipliers in Galois fields used for the elliptic curve cryptography. The results show that the proposed architecture can provide a very low error masking probability at the cost of a reasonable area overhead. The protected multiplier has no latency penalty when the predictor is pipelined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5994535/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12192566","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic manipulation detection codes and their applications for design of secure cryptographic devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic manipulation detection codes and their applications for design of secure cryptographic devices","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp51P61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092697S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979170","isNumber":"5993790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979170","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5993790","articleId":"5994535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5994540,"authors":[{"name":"Neagu M\u0103d\u0103lin","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Neagu","lastName":"M\u0103d\u0103lin","id":"38228338400"},{"name":"Liviu Miclea","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Liviu","lastName":"Miclea","id":"37329975200"},{"name":"Joan Figueras","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Joan","lastName":"Figueras","id":"37273619400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1056-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1053-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1055-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"5994540","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Redundancy","Error correction codes","Adders","Computer architecture","Error correction","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","error correction codes","error detection codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unidirectional error detection","on-line DRAM repair strategy","DRAM memory","error detection-correction codes","Berger codes","CS-K Berger codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","soft error","error detection","error localization","error correction","Berger code","Carry-Save addition"]}],"abstract":"A novel family of codes for the detection, localization and correction of unidirectional errors for DRAMs in proposed. For DRAM memories, multi-bit soft and hard errors are a growing concern, as the cell sizes continue to decrease with aggressive scaling down. As a result, the classical error detection/correction codes become less efficient to deal with multiple errors in a single word [16]. Berger codes are effective in detecting 100% of the unidirectional errors, but introduce considerable delay and does not provide any error correction feature. In order to decrease the computing time of the code check bits and, at the same time, to provide the possibility to localize the segment(s) where single or multiple errors have occurred, a modification of the Berger code is proposed, called Carry Save K Berger code (CS-K Berger). Basically consists in using Carry Save representations of the partial additions of the word segments. The number of check bits increases as compared with Berger code and consequently the code redundancy overhead increases but the delay in computing the check bits and the corresponding checking is drastically reduced. In addition, some patterns of unidirectional errors become correctable. The proposed CS-K Berger codes for different values of K are analyzed for different word lengths. The hardware required for code generation and verification is discussed as well, as the possibility of using this code for word segment replacement in online applications of DRAMs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unidirectional error detection, localization and correction for DRAMs: Application to on-line DRAM repair strategies","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5994540","startPage":"264","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2011.5994540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993790","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979170/5993790/05994540.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Unidirectional error detection, localization and correction for DRAMs: Application to on-line DRAM repair strategies","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994540/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192571","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unidirectional error detection, localization and correction for DRAMs: Application to on-line DRAM repair strategies","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp56P33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066667S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979170","isNumber":"5993790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979170","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5993790","articleId":"5994540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5994571,"authors":[{"name":"Damien Lambert","affiliation":["EADS Nucl\u00e9tudes, Courtaboeuf, France"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Lambert","id":"37276341700"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Desnoyers","affiliation":["EADS Nucl\u00e9tudes, Courtaboeuf, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Desnoyers","id":"37621643200"},{"name":"Didier Thouvenot","affiliation":["EADS Nucl\u00e9tudes, Courtaboeuf, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Thouvenot","id":"37621644600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0493-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0379-6566"}],"articleNumber":"5994571","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of neutron and proton SEU cross-sections on SRAMs between a few MeV and 50 MeV","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981575/5993792/05994571.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"154","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADECS.2009.5994571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993792","doi":"10.1109/RADECS.2009.5994571","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protons","Neutrons","Single event upset","Monte Carlo methods","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neutrons","protons","radiation effects","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neutron SEU cross-section","proton SEU cross-section","SRAM","single event upset","electron volt energy 50 MeV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radiation effects","single event upset","neutron","proton","SRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994571","abstract":"This work is axed on the difference between neutron and proton SEU cross-sections on SRAMs between a few MeV and 50 MeV where the cross-sections cannot be considered similar.

Two-dimension nonlinear finite element analysis including rotor motion is used for the calculation. The torque is calculated using different methods: Maxwell's stress tensor and Virtual work method. Comparison of results between linear and nonlinear magnetic circuit show that the torque is sensitive with magnetic saturation. The maximum torque of the linear case is about 15% higher than for the magnetic saturation case.

Specifically in case of broken bars, the amplitude of the left sideband component of a phase current is monitored in order to sense its signature. However MCSA has some drawbacks that are still under investigation. The main concern is that an efficient frequency transformation cannot be made under speed-varying condition, since slip and speed vary and so does the left sideband frequency. In this paper, an advanced use of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is proposed to overcome the limitation of the classical approaches based on Fourier Analysis (FA). Experimental and simulation results show the validity of the developed approach, leading to an effective diagnosis method for broken bars in induction machines.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994632","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994632.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","startPage":"424","endPage":"429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced diagnosis of broken bar fault in induction machines by using Discrete Wavelet Transform under time-varying condition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced diagnosis of broken bar fault in induction machines by using Discrete Wavelet Transform under time-varying condition","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994632/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12192846","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5994632/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced diagnosis of broken bar fault in induction machines by using Discrete Wavelet Transform under time-varying condition","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p424gritli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068134S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5994643,"authors":[{"name":"Fangrui Liu","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Canada"],"lastName":"Fangrui Liu","id":"37087301026"},{"name":"Bin Wu","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Canada"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37275265600"},{"name":"Navid Reza Zargari","affiliation":["Medium Voltage R&D Department, Rockwell Automation"],"firstName":"Navid Reza","lastName":"Zargari","id":"37266921000"},{"name":"Manish Pande","affiliation":["Medium Voltage R&D Department, Rockwell Automation"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Pande","id":"37344389900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0061-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0060-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0059-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5994643","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power harmonic filters","Harmonic analysis","Low pass filters","Rectifiers","Inductors","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","inductors","PWM rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductor current feedback control","high power PWM current source rectifier","switching frequency","resonant frequency","CSR","active resonance damping method","virtual resistance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resonance","active damping","current-source rectifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994643","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994643.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inductor current feedback control based active damping for high power PWM current source rectifier","abstract":"Due to the inductor-capacitor filter, a pulse width modulation (PWM) current-source rectifier (CSR) may experience LC resonance. A smaller ratio between the switching frequency and the resonant frequency of the CSR presents a challenge in designing active resonance damping methods in high-power applications. In this paper, different feedback states of filter inductor current and capacitor voltage are investigated to damp out the LC resonances. Besides proportional capacitor-voltage feedback (CVF), the derivative inductor-current feedback (ICF) provides an alternative approach for active damping and is comprehensively analyzed. Compared with the virtual-resistance (VR) based active damping strategy, controller design is simpler in this method. The ICF based active damping strategy works well for current-source rectifiers with low switching frequencies. Simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and validity of the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5994643/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12192856","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Inductor current feedback control based active damping for high power PWM current source rectifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inductor current feedback control based active damping for high power PWM current source rectifier","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p475liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051475S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5994644,"authors":[{"name":"Salwa Baserrah","affiliation":["Universitat Bremen, Bremen, Bremen, DE"],"firstName":"Salwa","lastName":"Baserrah","id":"37592254700"},{"name":"Bernd Orlik","affiliation":["Universitat Bremen, Bremen, Bremen, DE"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Orlik","id":"37278152500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0061-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0060-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0059-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5994644","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eddy currents","Lamination","Magnetic flux","Aluminum","Rotors","Stators","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","magnetic fields","permanent magnet machines","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current investigation","nonconventional flux concentrated permanent magnet transverse flux machine","finite element method","3D transient approach","magnetic field","FCPM-TFM","conducting materials","rotor","coil conductors","3D finite element method","3D FE method","Flux3D","stator laminations","steady state AC magnetic approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eddy","steady state","transient","losses","finite element","transverse flux","TFM","permanent magnet","segments"]}],"abstract":"The magnetic field in flux concentrated permanent magnet transverse flux machines; FCPM-TFM is of a three dimensional, 3D pattern.

Computations of losses in transient approach are shown for rotating machine operation of non-conventional FCPM-TFM in segmented structure.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994644","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","startPage":"47","endPage":"52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eddy current investigation study for a non-conventional flux concentrated permanent magnet transverse flux machine using finite element method via 3D transient approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Eddy current investigation study for a non-conventional flux concentrated permanent magnet transverse flux machine using finite element method via 3D transient approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994644/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12192857","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5994644/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eddy current investigation study for a non-conventional flux concentrated permanent magnet transverse flux machine using finite element method via 3D transient approach","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p47baserrah.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085739S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5994663,"authors":[{"name":"Ozegbe Chukwuma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View A and M University, Prairie View, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ozegbe","lastName":"Chukwuma","id":"37088298228"},{"name":"John Attia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Prairie View A and M University, Prairie View, TX, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Attia","id":"37444432400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0493-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0379-6566"}],"articleNumber":"5994663","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Transient analysis","Frequency domain analysis","CMOS integrated circuits","Transistors","Bandwidth","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","frequency-domain analysis","operational amplifiers","regression analysis","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single event transients","scaled CMOS operational amplifiers","frequency-domain analysis","nonlinear regression techniques","full width at half-maximum","peak amplitude","transient pulses","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous-time Fourier Transform","CMOS Op Amps","FFT","Single Event Transient"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994663","doi":"10.1109/RADECS.2009.5994663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADECS.2009.5994663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993792","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981575/5993792/05994663.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single event transients in scaled CMOS operational amplifiers","abstract":"Time-domain and a new frequency analysis are used to investigate the effects of SETs in CMOS op amps of different feature sizes.

First, a \u201cmountain test\u201d was performed, at an altitude of 3450 m, followed by a \u201ccave test\u201d at an underground location. The resulting real-time SER data have been combined to determine the neutron-SER and alpha-SER contributions under nominal conditions. The resulting neutron-SER is in very good agreement with data from accelerated SER tests. Also, the real-time alpha-SER agrees within 90% confidence limits with the accelerated SER result. However, the deviation in the case of alpha-SER is larger than for neutron-SER, which can be attributed to uncertainties in the alpha-particle flux observed by the product die. Radiation-induced soft errors are generally assumed to be random external events, resulting in a constant upset rate. From a statistical point of view, this corresponds to an exponential distribution. In the present work, statistical analysis is applied to the measured real-time SER data. It is shown that the exponential distribution indeed fits the mountain-SER data very well. In contrast, the cave-SER data are fitted rather poorly by the exponential distribution.","doi":"10.1109/RADECS.2009.5994673","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981575/5993792/05994673.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADECS.2009.5994673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Altitude and underground real-time SER tests of embedded SRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994673/","displayDocTitle":"Altitude and underground real-time SER tests of embedded SRAM","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994673/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"12193354","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Altitude and underground real-time SER tests of embedded SRAM","confLoc":"Brugge, Belgium","sourcePdf":"F01abstract1183manuscriptF1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036341S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5981575","isNumber":"5993792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981575","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5993792","articleId":"5994673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5994678,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Unfortunately, reconfigurable SRAM-based FPGAs are extremely susceptible to radiation induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs), especially when COTS components are largely adopted today. SEUs can not be eliminated completely using processing or layout solution, but their destructive effect can be mitigated through fault tolerant design techniques, e.g. redundancy structure, bitstream repair techniques or a combination of them. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of these mitigation techniques should be evaluated before using them in real applications. In this paper, several analytical reliability models are proposed to describe the reliability as well as the availability behavior of these mitigation strategies. These models may help designers to select proper level of protection according to the reliable specification of their system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The reliability and availability analysis of SEU mitigation techniques in SRAM-based FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/RADECS.2009.5994702","startPage":"497","endPage":"503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADECS.2009.5994702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993792","publicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 European Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981575/5993792/05994702.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The reliability and availability analysis of SEU mitigation techniques in SRAM-based FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994702/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"12193378","conferenceDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The reliability and availability analysis of SEU mitigation techniques in SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Brugge, Belgium","sourcePdf":"IP03abstract1163manuscriptPI3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117691S","chronDate":"14-18 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5981575","isNumber":"5993792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981575","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5993792","articleId":"5994702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5994727,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00e9raldine Chaumont","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"G\u00e9raldine","lastName":"Chaumont","id":"37593841800"},{"name":"Beno\u00eet Cornanguer","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet","lastName":"Cornanguer","id":"37669741500"},{"name":"Patrick Briand","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Briand","id":"37433568200"},{"name":"Christophe Prugne","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Prugne","id":"37594253300"},{"name":"Florence Malou","affiliation":["Centre National d''Etudes Spatiales, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Florence","lastName":"Malou","id":"37545325700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0493-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0492-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0379-6566"}],"articleNumber":"5994727","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"abstract":"New operational amplifiers have been ELDRS and heavy ions characterized.

Traditionally a traction drive mainly consists of a single-phase AC/DC converter, a DC-link bus and a three-phase DC/AC PWM converter. In the past, the DC-link bus was obtained through diode rectifiers, which generate line currents with high harmonic distortion and low power factor. In order to reduce these problems, the DC/AC converter is based nowadays on four-quadrant interlaced converters. Taking into account the power involved in electric drive trains, rectifier semiconductors are exposed to high stresses that can lead to failures. However, some types of failures such as power switch open-circuit faults may not be immediately detected and lead to more failures in other power switches. The goal of this work is to investigate the operation of a four quadrant interlaced converter, under normal and faulty conditions. For fault detection purposes, the average rectifier line current will be used. Experimental results are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectifiers","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Harmonic analysis","Reactive power","Harmonic distortion","Voltage control","Power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","fault diagnosis","harmonic distortion","power semiconductor switches","PWM power convertors","PWM rectifiers","traction motor drives","traction power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["railway power system","faulty conditions","traction drive","DC-AC converter","PWM converter","AC-DC converter","harmonic distortion","electric drive trains","rectifier semiconductors","power switches","quadrant interlaced converter","fault detection","voltage 25 kV","frequency 50 Hz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Railway","Interlaced converter","Fault diagnosis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994739","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994739.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a railway power system based on four quadrant converters operating under faulty conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a railway power system based on four quadrant converters operating under faulty conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994739/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994739/","accessionNumber":"12192875","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a railway power system based on four quadrant converters operating under faulty conditions","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1019mendes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066035S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5994754,"authors":[{"name":"Yukinori Inoue","affiliation":["Osaka Prefecture University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukinori","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37536918200"},{"name":"Shigeo Morimoto","affiliation":["Osaka Prefecture University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeo","lastName":"Morimoto","id":"37270653400"},{"name":"Masayuki Sanada","affiliation":["Osaka Prefecture University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Sanada","id":"37282018800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0061-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0060-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0059-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5994754","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":974},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Current control","Limiting","Resistance","Voltage control","Stators","Permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","permanent magnet motors","robust control","synchronous motor drives","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PMSM drive systems","current control","direct torque control","flux weakening control","permanent magnet synchronous motor","M-T frame","DTC","stable control"]}],"abstract":"This paper examines the control performance of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems based on current control and direct torque control (DTC) when flux-weakening control is applied. The control law in the M-T frame, which is used in the DTC, requires only armature resistance, whereas the control law in the d-q frame, which is used in current control, requires many motor parameters for flux-weakening control. The experimental results clarify the influence of parameter variation on the control characteristics of flux-weakening and torque limiting. The DTC-based motor drive system combined with the control laws in the M-T frame has several advantages, including insensitivity to parameter variation, simplicity of calculation, and stable control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of PMSM Drive systems based on current control and direct torque control in flux-weakening control region","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994754","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994754.pdf","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of PMSM Drive systems based on current control and direct torque control in flux-weakening control region","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994754/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12192890","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of PMSM Drive systems based on current control and direct torque control in flux-weakening control region","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1094inoue.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074117S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5994767,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These motors can realize magnetic suspension of rotor shafts without mechanical contacts. If the bearingless motor is applied to a canned motor pump, it is possible to levitate and rotate a impeller and a rotor shaft of a centrifugal pump. Therefore, the bearingless canned motor pump can realize next several advantages; (1) high power and high head, (2) clean liquid sending, (3) maintenance free, (4) longer operating life, (5) high chemical resistance. On the other hand, the rotor shaft and the stator must be covered with thick bulkheads, because fluid flows into the gap between the rotor shaft and the stator. It becomes difficult to generate sufficient suspension force for magnetic suspension, as a magnetic gap length is increased by the thick bulkheads. Accordingly, a novel structure of a 5-axis active control type bearingless motor, that can generate the sufficient suspension force under the wide-gap condition, has been proposed. This paper introduces pump characteristics with experiments using a prototype of the proposed novel structure.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994829","startPage":"148","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994829.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994829","endPage":"153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental estimation of a 5-axis active control type bearingless canned motor pump","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Experimental estimation of a 5-axis active control type bearingless canned motor pump","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994829/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12192965","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental estimation of a 5-axis active control type bearingless canned motor pump","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p148yamamoto.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037356S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5994836,"authors":[{"name":"Gennadi Y.

Computationally efficient FEA (CE-FEA), which is based on a reduced number of magnetostatic solutions for a motor model in the abc reference frame, is employed. As a result, a total of 10,000 candidate motor designs, which are included in the comprehensive study, are evaluated in a record short time on a typical PC-based workstation. The paper includes an engineering trade-off discussion based on a typical-reference motor, two optimum designs in terms of average torque and torque ripple, and a best-compromise solution. For the case-study, an order of magnitude reduction of the rated-load torque ripple and open-circuit cogging torque has been achieved. This is while, at the same time, the specific torque output has been increased by as much thirty seven percent.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994836.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1533","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of PM AC machines using computationally efficient - FEA and differential evolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Magnetostatics","Forging","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Magnetic cores"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC machines","evolutionary computation","finite element analysis","load (electric)","optimisation","Pareto optimisation","permanent magnet machines","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","PM AC machine","FEA","stator variable","rotor variable","IPM motor design","Pareto-based differential evolution","magnetostatic solution","PC-based workstation","engineering trade-off discussion","optimum design","magnitude reduction","rated-load torque ripple minimization","open circuit cogging torque"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["permanent magnet machines","PMAC","PMSM","IPM","multi-objective optimization","simplified FEA","differential evolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of PM AC machines using computationally efficient - FEA and differential evolution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12192972","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization of PM AC machines using computationally efficient - FEA and differential evolution","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p1528sizov.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043231S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5994843,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

ANNs are used effectively to determine the classification of induction machine rotor faults tested at different loads. First the raw signals are collected and features are extracted from the collected signals allowing the development of a data base necessary for the training of the ANNs. However, determining the ANN structure is a fundamental design issue and can be critical for the classification performance. The novelty in our works is that the genetic algorithms (GAs) can be used to select a smaller sub-set of ANN structure features that together form a genetically fit family for successful fault identification and classification tasks, at the same time, an appropriate simple structure of the ANN, in terms of the number of nodes in the hidden layer, can be determined. The proposed methodology is experimentally tested on 4kW/1500rpm induction machines at 50Hz/380V ; the obtained results provide a high level of accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994843","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994843.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of the feedforward neural network for rotor cage fault diagnosis in three-phase induction motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994843/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the feedforward neural network for rotor cage fault diagnosis in three-phase induction motors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994843/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12192979","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the feedforward neural network for rotor cage fault diagnosis in three-phase induction motors","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p194taibi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109479S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5994928,"authors":[{"name":"Hunter Hanzhuo Wu","affiliation":["Energy Dynamics Laboratory, Utah State University Research Foundation, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Hunter Hanzhuo","lastName":"Wu","id":"37405485700"},{"name":"Aaron Gilchrist","affiliation":["Energy Dynamics Laboratory, Utah State University Research Foundation, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Gilchrist","id":"37969211100"},{"name":"Ky Sealy","affiliation":["Energy Dynamics Laboratory, Utah State University Research Foundation, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Ky","lastName":"Sealy","id":"37946527300"},{"name":"Paul Israelsen","affiliation":["Energy Dynamics Laboratory, Utah State University Research Foundation, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Israelsen","id":"38180690400"},{"name":"Jeff Muhs","affiliation":["Energy Dynamics Laboratory, Utah State University Research Foundation, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Muhs","id":"37946527800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0061-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0060-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0059-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5994928","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1023},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","Zero voltage switching","Switches","Inductance","Voltage control","Mathematical model","Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","harmonic distortion","inductive power transmission","losses","power convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric voltage cancellation control","LCL converter","inductive power transfer systems","eliminated diode reverse recovery loss","H-bridge","common control schemes","normalized graph","engineering tradeoffs","efficient switching","total harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IPT Systems","LCL Resonant Converters","Clamp Mode Control","Symmetric Voltage Cancellation (SVC)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new design strategy for Symmetric Voltage Cancellation (SVC) Control used in LCL converters for Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) Systems.

Three common control schemes used in LCL converters were computed and normalized graphs are produced to aid designers in making engineering tradeoffs between more efficient switching schemes, total harmonic distortion (THD) and the overall cost of the converter. For a typical LCL converter example, total losses in the H-bridge can be reduced by a factor of 11 by restricting operation to a mode with no diode reverse recovery loss.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994928","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994928.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Symmetric Voltage Cancellation Control for LCL converters in Inductive Power Transfer Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994928/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Symmetric Voltage Cancellation Control for LCL converters in Inductive Power Transfer Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12193064","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994928/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Symmetric Voltage Cancellation Control for LCL converters in Inductive Power Transfer Systems","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p866wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059416S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5994946,"authors":[{"name":"Harapajan Singh","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Harapajan","lastName":"Singh","id":"37616824200"},{"name":"Mohd Zaki Abdullah","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Zaki","lastName":"Abdullah","id":"38182449900"},{"name":"Anas Qutieshat","affiliation":["AI-Balqa Applied University, Jordan"],"firstName":"Anas","lastName":"Qutieshat","id":"37946567000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0061-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0060-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0059-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5994946","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5994946","abstract":"Generally electrical motors have a designed lifespan of more than 20 years when supplied with the proper rated voltage and acceptable voltage waveforms. However when motors are subjected to lowered levels of supply voltage quality conditions appearing simultaneously due to disturbances of overvoltage or undervoltage, voltage unbalance and voltage waveform distortions, it causes motor windings to be seriously overheated and reduce significantly the lifespan of the motor. Detection and classification systems are expensive compared to the low cost of motors as such detection systems are seldom integrated together with the motor. In this paper, a control methodology to enable a simple low cost for the proper detection and classification of electrical supply voltage condition to electrical machines using Fuzzy-Min-Max neural network to significantly improve the satisfactory operation and life span of the electrical machines is presented. The proper application of supply voltage quality levels can reduce the downtime and operating expenses of the electrical machines, thus improving return of investment on assets managed by the organization. In this paper, a simple control methodology for the early stage detection and classification of the electrical voltage supply condition in electrical machines based on Fuzzy-Min-Max neural network is presented. The condition of the supply voltage quality to electrical machines is diagnosed and classified using Fuzzy Min-Max neural network. It will be shown that the developed method is simple in dealing with any supply voltage condition to detect and allows for the ease in classification of the supply voltage pattern. Test results for the classified patterns have shown that the method used for this classification scheme is able to correctly identify supply voltage conditions, and the adopted Fuzzy-Min-Max neural network condition monitoring based method is efficient.","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994946","startPage":"961","endPage":"965","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981421/5993850/05994946.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and classification of electrical supply voltage quality to electrical motors using the Fuzzy-Min-Max neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Induction motors","Voltage control","Feature extraction","Neural networks","Windings","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","fuzzy neural nets","power engineering computing","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical supply voltage quality","electrical motor","fuzzy min-max neural network","motor lifespan","control methodology","electrical voltage supply condition","network condition monitoring"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5994946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Detection and classification of electrical supply voltage quality to electrical motors using the Fuzzy-Min-Max neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5994946/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12193082","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and classification of electrical supply voltage quality to electrical motors using the Fuzzy-Min-Max neural network","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p961singh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056612S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981421","isNumber":"5993850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981421","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5993850","articleId":"5994946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5994950,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Barcaro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Barcaro","id":"37401730500"},{"name":"Emanuele Fornasiero","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Fornasiero","id":"37394181700"},{"name":"Nicola Bianchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37278301300"},{"name":"Silverio Bolognani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Silverio","lastName":"Bolognani","id":"37278297400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0061-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0060-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0059-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5994950","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":586},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Trajectory","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Traction motors","Permanent magnet motors","Permanent magnets","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","permanent magnets","railways","rotors","torque","traction motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior permanent magnet motor drive","railway traction","surface permanent magnet machine","commuter train","rotor geometry","permanent magnets","back electromotive force","standard load cycle","torque capability","machine average losses","power converter average losses"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a comparative analysis of various interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines and a surface permanent magnet (SPM) machine designed for a commuter train.

This implies not only a huge design effort, but also a shift from hardware to software design flavored tool chains. In this paper, a hardware complexity and energy dissipation are analyzed by implementing three programmable processor architectures that support 32- and 12-bit floating-point and 16-bit fixed-point arithmetics. The processors are based on the transport triggered architecture (TTA) that has a very low programmability overhead. We programmed a recently introduced selective spanning with fast enumeration (SSFE) soft-output detector for these processors. The processors are capable to achieve data rates required in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) 3G LTE system with a small energy dissipation. The analysis shows that at the same goodput rate a floating-point implementation can achieve a lower gate count and a better power efficiency than a fixed-point design. Combined with tool chain benefits, the floating-point arithmetic is becoming attractive for future SDR solutions.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2165830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6069495/05995137.pdf","startPage":"1588","endPage":"1598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2165830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed- and Floating-Point Processor Comparison for MIMO-OFDM Detector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Fixed- and Floating-Point Processor Comparison for MIMO-OFDM Detector","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995137/","accessionNumber":"12360019","volume":"5","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed- and Floating-Point Processor Comparison for MIMO-OFDM Detector","sourcePdf":"jstsp-janhunen-2165830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116359S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6069495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6069495","articleId":"5995137","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5995141,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The scheme consists of a dead-beat current controller that has been integrated with heuristic models of the voltage balancing and switching loss characteristics. The integration of a pulsewidth modulation scheme is also described. Simulation and experimental results are presented that confirm the correct operation of the control and modulation strategies.

Cyclic prefix (CP) and zero padding are well-known prefix construction methods, with the former being the most employed technique in practice due to its lower complexity. In this paper, we construct an OFDM system with a generalized CP. It is shown that the proposed generalized prefix effectively makes the channel experienced by the packet different from the actual channel. Using an optimization procedure, lower bit error rates (BERs) can be achieved, outperforming other prefix construction techniques. At the same time, the complexity of the technique is comparable with the CP method. The presented simulation results show that the proposed technique not only outperforms the CP method but is more robust in the presence of channel estimation errors and mobility as well. Therefore, the proposed method is appropriate for practical OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/05995178.pdf","startPage":"3684","endPage":"3693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2165741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2165741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Prefix Construction for OFDM Systems Over Quasi-Static Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms","Convolution","Receivers","Complexity theory","Transmitters","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized prefix construction","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM systems","quasi-static channels","intersymbol interference","zero padding","bit error rate","channel estimation errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep fading channels","generalized prefix","generalized skew-circular convolution","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Prefix Construction for OFDM Systems Over Quasi-Static Channels","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5995178/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300447","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Prefix Construction for OFDM Systems Over Quasi-Static Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-cooklev-2165741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064199S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5995178","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5995179,"authors":[{"name":"Sok-Ian Sou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Computer and Communications Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6045674/5995179/5995179-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sok-Ian Sou received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and information engineering from the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1997, 2004, and 2008, respectively.","From July to August 2009, she was a Visiting Scholar with Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.

Recent studies have shown that sparse vehicle traffic leads to network fragmentation, which poses a crucial research challenge for safety applications. In this paper, we analyze and quantify the improvement in VANET connectivity when a limited number of roadside units (RSUs) are deployed and to investigate the routing performance for broadcast-based safety applications in this enhanced VANET environment. Our results show that, even with a small number of RSUs, the performance in terms of the probability of network connectivity, the rehealing delay, the number of rehealing hops, and the message penetration time can be significantly improved in highway VANET scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/05995179.pdf","startPage":"3586","endPage":"3602","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2165739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2165739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing VANET Connectivity Through Roadside Units on Highways","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Safety","Road transportation","Routing","Advertising","Delay","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio broadcasting","road safety","telecommunication network routing","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VANET connectivity","roadside units","vehicular ad hoc network","source vehicle","warning message","potential danger zone","sparse vehicle traffic","network fragmentation","routing performance","broadcast based safety applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcasting","network connectivity","roadside units (RSUs)","safety applications","vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)","vehicular traffic modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing VANET Connectivity Through Roadside Units on Highways","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5995179/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291115","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing VANET Connectivity Through Roadside Units on Highways","sourcePdf":"tvt-sou-2165739-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102796S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5995179","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5995213,"authors":[{"name":"Halvard Hoilund-Kaupang","affiliation":["Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Halvard Kaupang (S'06) was born in Oslo, Norway, in 1980.

To improve computational efficiency, the KZK equation is utilized, and all transducers are circular-symmetric.

A custom 8-inch (20-cm) wafer is fabricated in a 0.35-\u03bcm two-poly, four-metal CMOS process and then CMUT arrays are built on top of the application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) on the wafer. We discuss advantages of the single-chip CMUT-on-CMOS approach in terms of receive sensitivity and SNR. Low-noise and high-gain design of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) optimized for a forward-looking volumetric-imaging CMUT array element is discussed as a challenging design example. Amplifier gain, bandwidth, dynamic range, and power consumption trade-offs are discussed in detail. With minimized parasitics provided by the CMUT-on-CMOS approach, the optimized TIA design achieves a 90 fA/\u221aHz input-referred current noise, which is less than the thermal-mechanical noise of the CMUT element. We show successful system operation with a pulseecho measurement. Transducer-noise-dominated detection in immersion is also demonstrated through output noise spectrum measurement of the integrated system at different CMUT bias voltages. A noise figure of 1.8 dB is obtained in the designed CMUT bandwidth of 10 to 20 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5995201/05995223.pdf","startPage":"1658","endPage":"1668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Front-end receiver electronics for high-frequency monolithic CMUT-on-CMOS imaging arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995223/","displayDocTitle":"Front-end receiver electronics for high-frequency monolithic CMUT-on-CMOS imaging arrays","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206386","pubMedId":"21859585","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995223/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Front-end receiver electronics for high-frequency monolithic CMUT-on-CMOS imaging arrays","sourcePdf":"t1181658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089539S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5995201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5995201","articleId":"5995223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5995229,"authors":[{"name":"Billy Y.

They are the so-called high-altitude platforms (HAPs) with important advantages with respect to satellites in terms of reduced cost of implementation, deployment, and launch. However, HAPs are characterized by a reduced coverage, as compared with satellites. Nevertheless, in recent literature, HAPs are not regarded as competitors of the satellite technology. On the contrary, the emphasis is on the effective and seamless integration among heterogeneous aerospace segments (GEO, LEO, and HAP) and aerospace segments with terrestrial wireless networks in order to globally extend the broadband wireless connectivity. This paper is focused on the role of HAPs in providing global connectivity in future communication systems and services. Potentialities, enabling technologies, and challenges are presented from the perspective of the integrated terrestrial/HAPs/satellite communications infrastructure.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2159690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2011.2159690","startPage":"1939","endPage":"1953","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6046149/05995281.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Role of High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs) in the Global Wireless Connectivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Role of High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs) in the Global Wireless Connectivity","volume":"99","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12300679","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995281/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Role of High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs) in the Global Wireless Connectivity","sourcePdf":"jproc-mohammed-2159690-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160295S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6046149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6046149","articleId":"5995281","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5995282,"authors":[{"name":"John C.

In addition, many of them ignore the inherent time-dependency between speech features. To address these issues, we propose to use dynamic kernel partial least squares (DKPLS) technique to model nonlinearities as well as to capture the dynamics in the data. The method is based on a kernel transformation of the source features to allow non-linear modeling and concatenation of previous and next frames to model the dynamics. Partial least squares regression is used to find a conversion function that does not overfit to the data. The resulting DKPLS algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm and does not require massive tuning. Existing statistical methods proposed for voice conversion are able to produce good similarity between the original and the converted target voices but the quality is usually degraded. The experiments conducted on a variety of conversion pairs show that DKPLS, being a statistical method, enables successful identity conversion while achieving a major improvement in the quality scores compared to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture-based model. In addition to enabling better spectral feature transformation, quality is further improved when aperiodicity and binary voicing values are converted using DKPLS with auxiliary information from spectral features.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice Conversion Using Dynamic Kernel Partial Least Squares Regression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2165944","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6125258/05995286.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2165944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6125258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Voice Conversion Using Dynamic Kernel Partial Least Squares Regression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5995286/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12470254","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice Conversion Using Dynamic Kernel Partial Least Squares Regression","sourcePdf":"tasl-helander-2165944-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139914S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"5995286","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5995288,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Costantini","affiliation":["E-GEOS, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6155684/5995288/5995288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mario Costantini was born in Italy in 1965.

Information-theoretic security-widely accepted as the strictest notion of security-relies on channel coding techniques that exploit the inherent randomness of the propagation channels to strengthen the security of digital communications systems. Motivated by recent developments in the field, we aim to characterize the fundamental secrecy limits of wireless networks. The paper is comprised of two separate parts. In Part I, we define the intrinsically secure communications graph (iS-graph), a random graph which describes the connections that can be securely established over a large-scale network. We provide conclusive results for the local connectivity of the Poisson iS-graph, in terms of node degrees and isolation probabilities. We show how the secure connectivity of the network varies with the wireless propagation effects, the secrecy rate threshold of each link, and the noise powers of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers. We then propose sectorized transmission and eavesdropper neutralization as viable strategies for improving the secure connectivity.

In this scheme, nodes that already obtain the broadcast message serve as relays to help forward it to other nodes. Relying on the sheer number of relay nodes, our scheme provides a new angle for jamming countermeasure, which not only significantly enhances the performance of jamming-resistant broadcast, but can readily be combined with other existing or emerging antijamming approaches in various applications. We present the collaborative broadcast protocol, and analyze its successful packet reception rate and the corresponding cooperation gain for both synchronous and asynchronous relays for a snapshot scenario. We also investigate the full broadcast process based on a Markov chain model and derive a closed-form expression of the average broadcast delay. Simulation results in both single-hop and multihop networks indicate that our scheme is a promising antijamming technique in wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12471622","htmlLink":"/document/5995292/","displayDocTitle":"Jamming-Resistant Collaborative Broadcast Using Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jamming-Resistant Collaborative Broadcast Using Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping","sourcePdf":"tifs-xiao-2165948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104012S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6126191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6126191","articleId":"5995292","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5995295,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/5995295/5995295-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angela Sara Cacciapuoti received the Dr. Eng. degree summa cum laude in Telecommunications Engineering in 2005, and the Ph.D degree with score \u201cexcellent\u201d in Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering in 2009, both from University of Naples Federico II.

Generally, cooperative spectrum sensing techniques require two successive stages: sensing and reporting. The reporting channels are usually assumed ideal. In this paper, we remove this assumption and we investigate the effects of reporting channels affected by temporal dispersion on cooperative spectrum sensing. To this aim, we propose two fusion schemes: a Widely Linear scheme and a Linear one. For both the schemes, closed-form expressions of the detection and the false alarm probabilities are derived. The performance are also evaluated numerically, and the results show that the Widely Linear detector outperforms the Linear one in operative conditions of practical interest. Moreover, for the sake of completeness, a theoretical comparison of the proposed detectors is carried out for reporting channels affected by multipath frequency non-selective fading. Surprisingly, the analysis proves that the two detectors perform exactly the same under this assumption. Therefore, there is not anymore advantage in using the Widely Linear scheme, which exhibits higher, although limited, computational complexity. The theoretical analysis is validated numerically.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.102164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","startPage":"3392","endPage":"3402","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05995295.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Techniques with Temporal Dispersive Reporting Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995295/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Techniques with Temporal Dispersive Reporting Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359527","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Techniques with Temporal Dispersive Reporting Channels","sourcePdf":"3392-tw1110-caccia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12071S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5995295","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995296,"authors":[{"name":"Eonpyo Hong","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eonpyo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37408571800"},{"name":"Dongsoo Har","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongsoo","lastName":"Har","id":"37282432300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5995296","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":716},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Time domain analysis","Computational complexity","Channel estimation","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-pass filters","block codes","computational complexity","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio reduction","MISO OFDM systems","adaptive all-pass filters","multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","space-frequency block coding","phase rotation","data recovery","side information","BER performance","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive all-pass filter (AAPF)","multiple-input single-output (MISO)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)"]}],"abstract":"A peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction based on adaptive all-pass filters (AAPFs) for multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems with space-frequency block coding is proposed.

The computational complexity is much lower than that of the B-SLM scheme and comparable to that of the LC-SLM scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.102169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05995296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.102169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","startPage":"3163","endPage":"3167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction for MISO OFDM Systems with Adaptive All-Pass Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction for MISO OFDM Systems with Adaptive All-Pass Filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359528","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995296/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction for MISO OFDM Systems with Adaptive All-Pass Filters","sourcePdf":"3163-tw1110-hong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059421S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5995296","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995297,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/5995297/5995297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 1987, 1991, and 2001, respectively.

We first establish the energy model of multihop cooperative MISO transmission. Based on the model, the energy consumption per bit of the network with high node density is minimized numerically by finding an optimal hop distance, and, to get the global minimum energy consumption, both hop distance and the number of cooperating nodes around each relay node for multihop transmission are jointly optimized. We also compare the performance between multihop cooperative MISO transmission and single-input-single-output (SISO) transmission, under the same network condition (high node density). We show that cooperative MISO transmission could be energy-inefficient compared with SISO transmission when the path-loss exponent becomes high. We then extend our investigation to the networks with varied node densities and show the effectiveness of the joint optimization method in this scenario using simulation results. It is shown that the optimal results depend on network conditions such as node density and path-loss exponent, and the simulation results are closely matched to those obtained using the numerical models for high node density cases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.102210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05995297.pdf","endPage":"3435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multihop Cooperative MISO Transmission with Optimal Hop Distance in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.102210","startPage":"3426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multihop Cooperative MISO Transmission with Optimal Hop Distance in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995297/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12359529","publicationDate":"October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995297/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Multihop Cooperative MISO Transmission with Optimal Hop Distance in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"3426-tw1110-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086441S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5995297","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995298,"authors":[{"name":"Sushruth N.

It converts the different gains of multiple subchannels, over which a codeword is transmitted, into a single effective flat-fading gain with the same codeword error rate. It facilitates link adaptation by helping each user to compute an accurate channel quality indicator (CQI), which is fed back to the base station to enable downlink rate adaptation and scheduling. However, the highly non-linear nature of EESM makes a performance analysis of adaptation and scheduling difficult; even the probability distribution of EESM is not known in closed-form. This paper shows that EESM can be accurately modeled as a lognormal random variable when the subchannel gains are Rayleigh distributed. The model is also valid when the subchannel gains are correlated in frequency or space. With some simplifying assumptions, the paper then develops a novel analysis of the performance of LTE's two CQI feedback schemes that use EESM to generate CQI. The comprehensive model and analysis quantify the joint effect of several critical components such as scheduler, multiple antenna mode, CQI feedback scheme, and EESM-based feedback averaging on the overall system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.102247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05995298.pdf","startPage":"3436","endPage":"3448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.102247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Accurate Model for EESM and its Application to Analysis of CQI Feedback Schemes and Scheduling in LTE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995298/","displayDocTitle":"An Accurate Model for EESM and its Application to Analysis of CQI Feedback Schemes and Scheduling in LTE","volume":"10","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359530","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995298/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Accurate Model for EESM and its Application to Analysis of CQI Feedback Schemes and Scheduling in LTE","sourcePdf":"3436-tw1110-donthi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127675S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5995298","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995299,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/5995299/5995299-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Wang (S'09) received the B.S. degree in Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2006.

The two communication peers in each pair of users transmit simultaneously to the relays in the first time slot, and the relays rebroadcast the received sum signal weighted by a complex gain, in the second time slot. For multi-user systems, the signal arriving at the users contains not only self interference from the back-propagation of user signals, but also inter-pair interferences from other pairs of users. In this paper, we use zero-forcing (ZF) to cancel the inter-user interference, assuming that channel-state information for all relay-peer connections are known at every relay, but no data exchange occurs between relays. We also derive two closed-form expressions for zero-forcing beamforming weights, corresponding to two different relay power constraints, which can be implemented in a distributed manner. The first approach uses standard ZF to null out every inter-pair interference and the second approach sets the total inter-pair interference to zero. We also derive a closed-form upper bound of the achievable sum-rate and show that both methods achieve the same multiplexing gain when the number of relays N is sufficient for perfect zero-forcing, namely 2K\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n + K, where K is the number of user pairs.

In this work, a method for reducing the sensitivity to spatial fading correlation through the bi-directional use of spatial resources is investigated. Firstly, the concept of bi-directional use of spatial resources is introduced and the fading characteristics of the proposed bi-directional multiple-input multiple-output (B-MIMO) system are investigated. The achievable rates of the B-MIMO system are then investigated and compared with those of conventional MIMO systems for beamforming and full rank transmission. Based on those results, conditions needed for the B-MIMO system to demonstrate a larger average achievable rate are evaluated. B-MIMO systems are found to efficiently reduce the sensitivity to spatial fading correlation, while supporting comparable achievable rates in spatially white environments.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.101955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/05995303.pdf","startPage":"3368","endPage":"3379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.101955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-Directional Use of Spatial Resources and Effects of Spatial Correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995303/","displayDocTitle":"Bi-Directional Use of Spatial Resources and Effects of Spatial Correlation","volume":"10","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359535","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995303/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Directional Use of Spatial Resources and Effects of Spatial Correlation","sourcePdf":"3368-tw1110-ju.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082584S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5995303","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995305,"authors":[{"name":"Sanguk Sagong","affiliation":["Agency for Defence Development, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sanguk","lastName":"Sagong","id":"37969209900"},{"name":"Jemin Lee","affiliation":["Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jemin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406236800"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5995305","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1420},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Interference","Random variables","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decode and forward communication","radio links","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-to-noise ratio","source-relay link","relay selection","underlay cognitive relay network","primary receiver","relay-destination link","backward reactive decode-and-forward scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","relay","cooperative diversity","reactive DF scheme"]}],"abstract":"This paper evaluates the capacity of the reactive decode-and-forward (R-DF) scheme, which considers the reduced relay candidates based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the source-relay link for relay selection in underlay cognitive relay networks.

It has been proven that R-DF scheme achieves the similar capacity of P-DF scheme as the primary receiver is located further from the secondary source. Since the transmission power of a secondary user is constrained by the location of the primary receiver, the performance of a cognitive relay network varies depending on the considered link for determining the relay candidates, between the source-relay and the relay-destination links. Hence, we also analyze the performance of the backward R-DF (BR-DF) scheme which the relay candidates are determined based on the relay-destination link.

At the nanoscale, a nanomachine is considered as the most basic functional unit which is able to perform very simple tasks. Communication among nanomachines will allow them to accomplish more complex functions in a distributed manner. In this paper, the state of the art in molecular electronics is reviewed to motivate the study of the Terahertz Band (0.1-10.0 THz) for electromagnetic (EM) communication among nano-devices. A new propagation model for EM communications in the Terahertz Band is developed based on radiative transfer theory and in light of molecular absorption. This model accounts for the total path loss and the molecular absorption noise that a wave in the Terahertz Band suffers when propagating over very short distances. Finally, the channel capacity of the Terahertz Band is investigated by using this model for different power allocation schemes, including a scheme based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses. The results show that for very short transmission distances, in the order of several tens of millimeters, the Terahertz channel supports very large bit-rates, up to few terabits per second, which enables a radically different communication paradigm for nanonetworks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","volume":"10","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12359538","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995306/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for Electromagnetic Wireless Nanonetworks in the Terahertz Band","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for Electromagnetic Wireless Nanonetworks in the Terahertz Band","sourcePdf":"3211-tw1110-jornet.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077914S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"476","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"5995306","onlineDate":"22 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5995308,"authors":[{"name":"Anat Levin","affiliation":["Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"],"firstName":"Anat","lastName":"Levin","id":"37282624200"},{"name":"Yair Weiss","affiliation":["Hebrew University, Israel"],"firstName":"Yair","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37282991700"},{"name":"Fredo Durand","affiliation":["CSAIL, MIT, USA"],"firstName":"Fredo","lastName":"Durand","id":"37266781600"},{"name":"William T.

The problem has been studied intensively with considerable progress made in recent years. However, it seems that image denoising algorithms are starting to converge and recent algorithms improve over previous ones by only fractional dB values. It is thus important to understand how much more can we still improve natural image denoising algorithms and what are the inherent limits imposed by the actual statistics of the data. The challenge in evaluating such limits is that constructing proper models of natural image statistics is a long standing and yet unsolved problem. To overcome the absence of accurate image priors, this paper takes a non parametric approach and represents the distribution of natural images using a huge set of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sup>\n patches. We then derive a simple statistical measure which provides a lower bound on the optimal Bayesian minimum mean square error (MMSE). This imposes a limit on the best possible results of denoising algorithms which utilize a fixed support around a denoised pixel and a generic natural image prior. Our findings suggest that for small windows, state of the art denoising algorithms are approaching optimality and cannot be further improved beyond ~ 0.1dB values.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995309.pdf","startPage":"2833","endPage":"2840","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Natural image denoising: Optimality and inherent bounds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Noise measurement","Image denoising","PSNR","Approximation methods","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","image denoising","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural image denoising algorithms","optimal Bayesian minimum mean square error","MMSE","pixel denoising","generic natural image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Natural image denoising: Optimality and inherent bounds","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995309/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218671","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural image denoising: Optimality and inherent bounds","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05379S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995311,"authors":[{"name":"Anton Andriyenko","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Andriyenko","id":"37944903700"},{"name":"Konrad Schindler","affiliation":["Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Group, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Schindler","id":"37267277500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995311","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":192,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Target tracking","Optimization","Minimization","Detectors","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","conjugate gradient methods","image sequences","Kalman filters","optimisation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitarget tracking","continuous energy function minimization","optimization scheme","conjugate gradient method","periodic transdimensional jumps","variable-dimensional search space","video sequences","extended Kalman filter baseline","ILP-based state-of-the-art tracker","computer vision"]}],"abstract":"We propose to formulate multi-target tracking as minimization of a continuous energy function. Other than a number of recent approaches we focus on designing an energy function that represents the problem as faithfully as possible, rather than one that is amenable to elegant optimization. We then go on to construct a suitable optimization scheme to find strong local minima of the proposed energy. The scheme extends the conjugate gradient method with periodic trans-dimensional jumps. These moves allow the search to escape weak minima and explore a much larger portion of the variable-dimensional search space, while still always reducing the energy. To demonstrate the validity of this approach we present an extensive quantitative evaluation both on synthetic data and on six different real video sequences. In both cases we achieve a significant performance improvement over an extended Kalman filter baseline as well as an ILP-based state-of-the-art tracker.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995311","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-target tracking by continuous energy minimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-target tracking by continuous energy minimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995311/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218673","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995311/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-target tracking by continuous energy minimization","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083121S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"192","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995312,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Jun Qi","affiliation":["Beckman Institute, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Guo-Jun","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085376043"},{"name":"Charu Aggarwal","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Most of the existing learning algorithms focuses on leveraging the knowledge transfer process which is specific to a given category. However, in many cases, such a process may not be very effective when a particular target category has very few samples. In such cases, it is interesting to examine, whether it is feasible to use cross-category knowledge for improving the learning process by exploring the knowledge in correlated categories. Such a task can be quite challenging due to variations in semantic similarities and differences between categories, which could either help or hinder the cross-category learning process. In order to address this challenge, we develop a cross-category label propagation algorithm, which can directly propagate the inter-category knowledge at instance level between the source and the target categories. Furthermore, this algorithm can automatically detect conditions under which the transfer process can be detrimental to the learning process. This provides us a way to know when the transfer of cross-category knowledge is both useful and desirable. We present experimental results on real image and video data sets in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995312","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995312.pdf","startPage":"897","endPage":"904","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards cross-category knowledge propagation for learning visual concepts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards cross-category knowledge propagation for learning visual concepts","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995312/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218674","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995312/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards cross-category knowledge propagation for learning visual concepts","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064687S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5995313,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Rigamonti","affiliation":["CVLab, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Rigamonti","id":"37945422400"},{"name":"Matthew A.

This objective function consists of two components: entropy rate of a random walk on a graph and a balancing term. The entropy rate favors formation of compact and homogeneous clusters, while the balancing function encourages clusters with similar sizes. We present a novel graph construction for images and show that this construction induces a matroid - a combinatorial structure that generalizes the concept of linear independence in vector spaces. The segmentation is then given by the graph topology that maximizes the objective function under the matroid constraint. By exploiting submodular and mono-tonic properties of the objective function, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm. Furthermore, we prove an approximation bound of \u00bd for the optimality of the solution. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley segmentation benchmark show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the art in all the standard evaluation metrics.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995323","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995323.pdf","startPage":"2097","endPage":"2104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy rate superpixel segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995323/","displayDocTitle":"Entropy rate superpixel segmentation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218685","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995323/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy rate superpixel segmentation","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067205S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"435","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5995324,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37655008600"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375500"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995324","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":185,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1421},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vegetation","Face","Mutual information","Feature extraction","Encoding","Face recognition","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image coding","image matching","law","trees (mathematics)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled information-theoretic encoding","automatic face photo-sketch recognition","law enforcement","image matching","classification algorithm","inter-modality face recognition","feature extraction","quantized feature spaces","coupled information-theoretic projection tree","face sketch database"]}],"abstract":"Automatic face photo-sketch recognition has important applications for law enforcement. Recent research has focused on transforming photos and sketches into the same modality for matching or developing advanced classification algorithms to reduce the modality gap between features extracted from photos and sketches. In this paper, we propose a new inter-modality face recognition approach by reducing the modality gap at the feature extraction stage. A new face descriptor based on coupled information-theoretic encoding is used to capture discriminative local face structures and to effectively match photos and sketches. Guided by maximizing the mutual information between photos and sketches in the quantized feature spaces, the coupled encoding is achieved by the proposed coupled information-theoretic projection tree, which is extended to the randomized forest to further boost the performance. We create the largest face sketch database including sketches of 1, 194 people from the FERET database. Experiments on this large scale dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995324","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995324.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled information-theoretic encoding for face photo-sketch recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995324/","displayDocTitle":"Coupled information-theoretic encoding for face photo-sketch recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218686","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995324/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled information-theoretic encoding for face photo-sketch recognition","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116794S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"185","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5995329,"authors":[{"name":"Behjat Siddiquie","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Behjat","lastName":"Siddiquie","id":"37393934700"},{"name":"Rogerio S.

Given a multi-attribute query, we also utilize other attributes in the vocabulary which are not present in the query, for ranking/retrieval. Furthermore, we integrate ranking and retrieval within the same formulation, by posing them as structured prediction problems.

Even contrast and brightness adjustments are challenging because they require taking into account the image content. Photographers are also known for having different retouching preferences. As the result of this complexity, rule-based, one-size-fits-all automatic techniques often fail. This problem can greatly benefit from supervised machine learning but the lack of training data has impeded work in this area. Our first contribution is the creation of a high-quality reference dataset. We collected 5,000 photos, manually annotated them, and hired 5 trained photographers to retouch each picture. The result is a collection of 5 sets of 5,000 example input-output pairs that enable supervised learning. We first use this dataset to predict a user's adjustment from a large training set. We then show that our dataset and features enable the accurate adjustment personalization using a carefully chosen set of training photos. Finally, we introduce difference learning: this method models and predicts difference between users. It frees the user from using predetermined photos for training. We show that difference learning enables accurate prediction using only a handful of examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995332.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning photographic global tonal adjustment with a database of input / output image pairs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Measurement","Ground penetrating radar","Cameras","Histograms","Supervised learning","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","learning (artificial intelligence)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning photographic global tonal adjustment","output image pairs","input image pairs","photographs adjustment","compelling renditions","brightness adjustments","supervised machine learning","users adjustment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning photographic global tonal adjustment with a database of input / output image pairs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995332/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218694","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning photographic global tonal adjustment with a database of input / output image pairs","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078654S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5995333,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Chang","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Chang","id":"37406506700"},{"name":"John W.

Instead of matching image features/pixels across images, the inverse ray tracing approach models the image generation process directly and searches for the best 3D geometry and surface reflectance model to explain all the observations. Here the image generation process is modeled through volumetric ray tracing, where the occlusion/visibility is exactly modeled. All the constraints (including ray constraints and prior knowledge about the geometry) are put into the Ray Markov Random Field (Ray MRF) formulation, developed in [10]. Differently from [10], where the voxel colors are estimated independently of the voxel occupancies, in this work, both voxel occupancies and colors (i.e., both geometry and appearance) are modeled and estimated jointly in the same inversey ray tracing framework (Ray MRF + deep belief propagation) and implemented in a common message passing scheme, which improves the accuracy significantly as verified by extensive experiments. The complete inverse ray tracing approach can better handle difficult problems in multi-view stereo than do traditional methods, including large camera baseline, occlusion, matching ambiguities, color constant or slowly changing regions, etc., without additional information and assumptions, such as initial surface estimate or simple background assumption. A prototype system is built and tested over several challenging datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art systems, which demonstrates its good performance and wide applicability.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995334","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995334.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A complete statistical inverse ray tracing approach to multi-view stereo","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995334/","displayDocTitle":"A complete statistical inverse ray tracing approach to multi-view stereo","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218696","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995334/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complete statistical inverse ray tracing approach to multi-view stereo","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066513S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5995344,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Ming Cheng","affiliation":["TNList, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Ming-Ming","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37532083700"},{"name":"Guo-Xin Zhang","affiliation":["TNList, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538428900"},{"name":"Niloy J.

The proposed algorithm is simple, efficient, and yields full resolution saliency maps.

An SD system is user-specific, i.e., customized for some particular user while an SI system has to cope with a large number of users. These two types of systems pose variant challenges and have to be treated differently. In this paper, we propose a simple deterministic model to tackle the problem. The model first seeks a low-dimensional manifold where visual features extracted from the frames of a video can be projected onto a continuous deterministic curve embedded in a path graph. Moreover, it can map arbitrary points on the curve back into the image space, making it suitable for temporal interpolation. Based on the model, we develop two separate strategies for SD and SI lipreading. The former is turned into a simple curve-matching problem while for the latter, we propose a video-normalization scheme to improve the system developed by Zhao et al. We evaluated our system on the OuluVS database and achieved recognition rates more than 20% higher than the ones reported by Zhao et al. in both SD and SI testing scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995345","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","startPage":"137","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a practical lipreading system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards a practical lipreading system","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995345/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218707","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a practical lipreading system","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06729S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995347,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Torralba","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Torralba","id":"38183107900"},{"name":"Alexei A.

They have been the chief reason for the considerable progress in the field, not just as source of large amounts of training data, but also as means of measuring and comparing performance of competing algorithms. At the same time, datasets have often been blamed for narrowing the focus of object recognition research, reducing it to a single benchmark performance number. Indeed, some datasets, that started out as data capture efforts aimed at representing the visual world, have become closed worlds unto themselves (e.g. the Corel world, the Caltech-101 world, the PASCAL VOC world). With the focus on beating the latest benchmark numbers on the latest dataset, have we perhaps lost sight of the original purpose? The goal of this paper is to take stock of the current state of recognition datasets. We present a comparison study using a set of popular datasets, evaluated based on a number of criteria including: relative data bias, cross-dataset generalization, effects of closed-world assumption, and sample value. The experimental results, some rather surprising, suggest directions that can improve dataset collection as well as algorithm evaluation protocols. But more broadly, the hope is to stimulate discussion in the community regarding this very important, but largely neglected issue.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995347","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995347.pdf","startPage":"1521","endPage":"1528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unbiased look at dataset bias","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Unbiased look at dataset bias","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995347/","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218709","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995347/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unbiased look at dataset bias","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063461S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"648","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5995350,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Sharma","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Computer Science, University of Maryland, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37857771300"},{"name":"David W Jacobs","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Computer Science, University of Maryland, USA"],"firstName":"David W","lastName":"Jacobs","id":"37317549000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995350","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":222,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Face","Training","Vectors","Image resolution","Three dimensional displays","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image resolution","least squares approximations","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bypassing synthesis","PLS","partial least squares","face recognition","feature selection","subspace comparison framework","multimodal recognition","pixel intensities"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel way to perform multi-modal face recognition.

Our framework is built upon a latent SVM formulation where latent variables capture the degree of importance of each attribute for each action class.

In addition to using class labels of training data, we also associate label information with each dictionary item (columns of the dictionary matrix) to enforce discriminability in sparse codes during the dictionary learning process. More specifically, we introduce a new label consistent constraint called `discriminative sparse-code error' and combine it with the reconstruction error and the classification error to form a unified objective function. The optimal solution is efficiently obtained using the K-SVD algorithm. Our algorithm learns a single over-complete dictionary and an optimal linear classifier jointly. It yields dictionaries so that feature points with the same class labels have similar sparse codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms many recently proposed sparse coding techniques for face and object category recognition under the same learning conditions.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995354","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Training","Image coding","Face","Testing","Equations","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionaries","face recognition","image classification","image coding","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["label consistent","K-SVD","training data","dictionary learning process","discriminative sparse code error","reconstruction error","classification error","optimal linear classifier","face recognition","object category recognition"]}],"publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995354.pdf","startPage":"1697","endPage":"1704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995354","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning a discriminative dictionary for sparse coding via label consistent K-SVD","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995354/","displayDocTitle":"Learning a discriminative dictionary for sparse coding via label consistent K-SVD","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218716","htmlLink":"/document/5995354/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning a discriminative dictionary for sparse coding via label consistent K-SVD","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07241S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"427","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5995357,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Ott","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Ott","id":"37398667400"},{"name":"Mark Everingham","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Everingham","id":"37266138300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995357","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":690},"abstract":"The deformable part-based model (DPM) proposed by Felzenszwalb et al. has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in object localization. The model offers a high degree of learnt invariance by utilizing viewpoint-dependent mixture components and movable parts in each mixture component. One might hope to increase the accuracy of the DPM by increasing the number of mixture components and parts to give a more faithful model, but limited training data prevents this from being effective. We propose an extension to the DPM which allows for sharing of object part models among multiple mixture components as well as object classes. This results in more compact models and allows training examples to be shared by multiple components, ameliorating the effect of a limited size training set. We (i) reformulate the DPM to incorporate part sharing, and (ii) propose a novel energy function allowing for coupled training of mixture components and object classes. We report state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC dataset.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995357.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1520","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared parts for deformable part-based models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Detectors","Feature extraction","Computational modeling","Training data","Deformable models","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared parts","deformable part based models","object localization","learnt invariance","viewpoint dependent mixture components","PASCAL VOC dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Shared parts for deformable part-based models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995357/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218719","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared parts for deformable part-based models","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103808S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995360,"authors":[{"name":"Oded Shahar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Applied Math, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"],"firstName":"Oded","lastName":"Shahar","id":"37944981300"},{"name":"Alon Faktor","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Applied Math, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"],"firstName":"Alon","lastName":"Faktor","id":"37944980300"},{"name":"Michal Irani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Applied Math, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Irani","id":"37282593100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995360","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strontium","Spatial resolution","Video sequences","Cameras","Dynamics","Equations","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image sequences","statistical analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space time super resolution","single video","SR","image details","pixel size","video framerate","video sequence","video recordings","ST patches","spatio temporal scales","statistical analysis","subframe accuracy"]}],"abstract":"Spatial Super Resolution (SR) aims to recover fine image details, smaller than a pixel size. Temporal SR aims to recover rapid dynamic events that occur faster than the video frame-rate, and are therefore invisible or seen incorrectly in the video sequence. Previous methods for Space-Time SR combined information from multiple video recordings of the same dynamic scene. In this paper we show how this can be done from a single video recording. Our approach is based on the observation that small space-time patches (`ST-patches', e.g., 5\u00d75\u00d73) of a single `natural video', recur many times inside the same video sequence at multiple spatio-temporal scales. We statistically explore the degree of these ST-patch recurrences inside `natural videos', and show that this is a very strong statistical phenomenon. Space-time SR is obtained by combining information from multiple ST-patches at sub-frame accuracy. We show how finding similar ST-patches can be done both efficiently (with a randomized-based search in space-time), and at sub-frame accuracy (despite severe motion aliasing). Our approach is particularly useful for temporal SR, resolving both severe motion aliasing and severe motion blur in complex `natural videos'.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time super-resolution from a single video","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995360","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995360.pdf","startPage":"3353","endPage":"3360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Space-time super-resolution from a single video","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995360/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218722","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time super-resolution from a single video","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0835S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995364,"authors":[{"name":"Patrik Sundberg","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Patrik","lastName":"Sundberg","id":"37945068100"},{"name":"Thomas Brox","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Brox","id":"37541664500"},{"name":"Michael Maire","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Maire","id":"37268733900"},{"name":"Pablo Arbel\u00e1ez","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Arbel\u00e1ez","id":"37397854500"},{"name":"Jitendra Malik","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Malik","id":"37282929000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995364","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995364","abstract":"In this work, we propose a contour and region detector for video data that exploits motion cues and distinguishes occlusion boundaries from internal boundaries based on optical flow.

Our key contribution is to show that, for noisy data, this non-convex problem can be solved very efficiently and in closed form from the SVD of the noisy data matrix. Remarkably, this is true for both one or more subspaces. An important difference with respect to existing methods is that our framework results in a polynomial thresholding of the singular values with minimal shrinkage. Indeed, a particular case of our framework in the case of a single subspace leads to classical PCA, which requires no shrinkage. In the case of multiple subspaces, our framework provides an affinity matrix that can be used to cluster the data according to the sub-spaces. In the case of data corrupted by outliers, a closed-form solution appears elusive. We thus use an augmented Lagrangian optimization framework, which requires a combination of our proposed polynomial thresholding operator with the more traditional shrinkage-thresholding operator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218727","htmlLink":"/document/5995365/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A closed form solution to robust subspace estimation and clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A closed form solution to robust subspace estimation and clustering","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057089S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995366,"authors":[{"name":"Katerina Fragkiadaki","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Katerina","lastName":"Fragkiadaki","id":"37944899600"},{"name":"Jianbo Shi","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jianbo","lastName":"Shi","id":"37275094100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995366","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":939},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Motion segmentation","Topology","Tracking","Optical variables measurement","Indexes","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image motion analysis","image segmentation","mobile agents","object tracking","video coding","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection free tracking","video segmentation","video interaction","agent interaction","detection based tracking method","moving agent","graph partitioning","trajectory domain","ground trajectory","trajectory weight matrix","time intersection","motion information","spatiotemporal segmentation","large temporal context encoding"]}],"abstract":"We propose a detection-free system for segmenting multiple interacting and deforming people in a video.

Attractive weights are set between similarly moving trajectories. Information from foreground topology complements motion information and our spatiotemporal segments can be interpreted as connected moving entities rather than just trajectory groups of similar motion.

We propose a random forest with discriminative decision trees algorithm, where every tree node is a discriminative classifier that is trained by combining the information in this node as well as all upstream nodes. Our method is tested on both subordinate categorization and activity recognition datasets. Experimental results show that our method identifies semantically meaningful visual information and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on various datasets.","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995368.pdf","startPage":"1577","endPage":"1584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining randomization and discrimination for fine-grained image categorization","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995368","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Combining randomization and discrimination for fine-grained image categorization","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218730","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995368/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining randomization and discrimination for fine-grained image categorization","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101653S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995372,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Rhemann","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Rhemann","id":"37398257300"},{"name":"Asmaa Hosni","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Asmaa","lastName":"Hosni","id":"37391559100"},{"name":"Michael Bleyer","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bleyer","id":"37391563900"},{"name":"Carsten Rother","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Rother","id":"37326487100"},{"name":"Margrit Gelautz","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Margrit","lastName":"Gelautz","id":"37267041100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995372","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":337,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":2777},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Optical imaging","Labeling","Image color analysis","Image segmentation","Smoothing methods","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","edge detection","image segmentation","information filtering","real-time systems","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-volume filtering","visual correspondence","computer vision","labeling problem","edge preserving filter","winner-take-all label selection","disparity map","Middlebury stereo benchmark","optical flow field","interactive image segmentation"]}],"abstract":"Many computer vision tasks can be formulated as labeling problems. The desired solution is often a spatially smooth labeling where label transitions are aligned with color edges of the input image. We show that such solutions can be efficiently achieved by smoothing the label costs with a very fast edge preserving filter. In this paper we propose a generic and simple framework comprising three steps: (i) constructing a cost volume (ii) fast cost volume filtering and (iii) winner-take-all label selection. Our main contribution is to show that with such a simple framework state-of-the-art results can be achieved for several computer vision applications. In particular, we achieve (i) disparity maps in real-time, whose quality exceeds those of all other fast (local) approaches on the Middlebury stereo benchmark, and (ii) optical flow fields with very fine structures as well as large displacements. To demonstrate robustness, the few parameters of our framework are set to nearly identical values for both applications. Also, competitive results for interactive image segmentation are presented. With this work, we hope to inspire other researchers to leverage this framework to other application areas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast cost-volume filtering for visual correspondence and beyond","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995372","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995372.pdf","startPage":"3017","endPage":"3024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast cost-volume filtering for visual correspondence and beyond","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995372/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218734","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast cost-volume filtering for visual correspondence and beyond","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10264S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"337","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5995373,"authors":[{"name":"Danfeng Qin","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Danfeng","lastName":"Qin","id":"37951383300"},{"name":"Stephan Gammeter","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Gammeter","id":"37397296800"},{"name":"Lukas Bossard","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Bossard","id":"37397292400"},{"name":"Till Quack","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Till","lastName":"Quack","id":"37397292000"},{"name":"Luc van Gool","affiliation":["K.U.

Our method is based on an analysis of the k-reciprocal nearest neighbor structure in the image space. At query time the information obtained from this process is used to treat different parts of the ranked retrieval list with different distance measures. This leads effectively to a re-ranking of retrieved images. As we will show, this has two benefits: first, using different similarity measures for different parts of the ranked list allows for compensation of the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. Second, it allows for dealing with the uneven distribution of images in the data space. Dealing with both challenges has very beneficial effect on retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, a major part of the process happens offline, so it does not affect speed at retrieval time. Finally, the method operates on the bag-of-words level only, thus it could be combined with any additional measures on e.g. either descriptor level or feature geometry making room for further improvement. We evaluate our approach on common object retrieval benchmarks and demonstrate a significant improvement over standard bag-of-words retrieval.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995373.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"784","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hello neighbor: Accurate object retrieval with k-reciprocal nearest neighbors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Accuracy","Vocabulary","Image retrieval","Quantization","Visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object retrieval","k-reciprocal nearest neighbors","image retrieval"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hello neighbor: Accurate object retrieval with k-reciprocal nearest neighbors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995373/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218735","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hello neighbor: Accurate object retrieval with k-reciprocal nearest neighbors","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08231S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5995380,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Mensink","affiliation":["Xerox Research Centre Europe, France","LEAR, INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Mensink","id":"37397489600"},{"name":"Jakob Verbeek","affiliation":["LEAR, INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, France"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Verbeek","id":"37397584100"},{"name":"Gabriela Csurka","affiliation":["Xerox Research Centre Europe, France"],"firstName":"Gabriela","lastName":"Csurka","id":"37332226000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995380","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":398},"abstract":"We propose structured models for image labeling that take into account the dependencies among the image labels explicitly. These models are more expressive than independent label predictors, and lead to more accurate predictions. While the improvement is modest for fully-automatic image labeling, the gain is significant in an interactive scenario where a user provides the value of some of the image labels. Such an interactive scenario offers an interesting trade-off between accuracy and manual labeling effort. The structured models are used to decide which labels should be set by the user, and transfer the user input to more accurate predictions on other image labels. We also apply our models to attribute-based image classification, where attribute predictions of a test image are mapped to class probabilities by means of a given attribute-class mapping. In this case the structured models are built at the attribute level. We also consider an interactive system where the system asks a user to set some of the attribute values in order to maximally improve class prediction performance. Experimental results on three publicly available benchmark data sets show that in all scenarios our structured models lead to more accurate predictions, and leverage user input much more effectively than state-of-the-art independent models.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","interactive systems","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structured prediction model learning","interactive image labeling","independent label predictor","fully-automatic image labeling","attribute-based image classification","interactive system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995380","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995380.pdf","startPage":"833","endPage":"840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning structured prediction models for interactive image labeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning structured prediction models for interactive image labeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995380/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995380/","accessionNumber":"12218742","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning structured prediction models for interactive image labeling","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066641S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5995384,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Hao Kuo","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hao","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37405395500"},{"name":"Ram Nevatia","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Nevatia","id":"37279644100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995384","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":130,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1411},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995384","abstract":"We address the problem of multi-person tracking in a complex scene from a single camera.

During off-line learning, a small set of local image descriptors is selected to be used in on-line learned appearances-based affinity models effectively and efficiently. Given short but reliable track-lets generated by frame-to-frame association of detection responses, we identify them as query tracklets and gallery tracklets. For each gallery tracklet, a target-specific appearance model is learned from the on-line training samples collected by spatio-temporal constraints. Both gallery tracklets and query tracklets are fed into hierarchical association framework to obtain final tracking results.

Such a sparse coding model actually assumes that the coding residual follows Gaussian or Laplacian distribution, which may not be accurate enough to describe the coding errors in practice. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, namely the robust sparse coding (RSC), by modeling the sparse coding as a sparsity-constrained robust regression problem. The RSC seeks for the MLE (maximum likelihood estimation) solution of the sparse coding problem, and it is much more robust to outliers (e.g., occlusions, corruptions, etc.) than SRC. An efficient iteratively reweighted sparse coding algorithm is proposed to solve the RSC model.

We first apply object detectors to every video frame. Pairs of detection responses from every two consecutive frames are then used to build a graph of tracklets. The graph helps transitively link the best matching tracklets that do not violate hard and soft contextual constraints between the resulting tracks. We prove that this data association problem can be formulated as finding the maximum-weight independent set (MWIS) of the graph. We present a new, polynomial-time MWIS algorithm, and prove that it converges to an optimum. Similarity and contextual constraints between object detections, used for data association, are learned online from object appearance and motion properties.

Such statistics is usually obtained from large collections of natural images. We claim that the substantial internal data redundancy within a single natural image (e.g., recurrence of small image patches), gives rise to powerful internal statistics, obtained directly from the image itself. While internal patch recurrence has been used in various applications, we provide a parametric quantification of this property. We show that the likelihood of an image patch to recur at another image location can be expressed parametricly as a function of the spatial distance from the patch, and its gradient content. This \u201cinternal parametric prior\u201d is used to improve existing algorithms that rely on patch recurrence. Moreover, we show that internal image-specific statistics is often more powerful than general external statistics, giving rise to more powerful image-specific priors. In particular: (i) Patches tend to recur much more frequently (densely) inside the same image, than in any random external collection of natural images. (ii) To find an equally good external representative patch for all the patches of an image, requires an external database of hundreds of natural images. (iii) Internal statistics often has stronger predictive power than external statistics, indicating that it may potentially give rise to more powerful image-specific priors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internal statistics of a single natural image","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995401","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995401.pdf","startPage":"977","endPage":"984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Internal statistics of a single natural image","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995401/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218763","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internal statistics of a single natural image","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096111S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":5995402,"authors":[{"name":"Weilong Yang","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Weilong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37402761100"},{"name":"George Toderici","affiliation":["Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Toderici","id":"37295630600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995402","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":452},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Training","YouTube","Feature extraction","Semantics","Support vector machines","Tagging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","social networking (online)","video retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative tag learning","YouTube videos","content-based automated tag learning","latent sub-tag label","latent learning framework","LogitBoost","tag label"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of content-based automated tag learning.

In this paper we propose to use the kernel partial least squares (KPLS) regression for age estimation. The KPLS (or linear PLS) method has several advantages over previous approaches: (1) the KPLS can reduce feature dimensionality and learn the aging function simultaneously in a single learning framework, instead of performing each task separately using different techniques; (2) the KPLS can find a small number of latent variables, e.g., 20, to project thousands of features into a very low-dimensional subspace, which may have great impact on real-time applications; and (3) the KPLS regression has an output vector that can contain multiple labels, so that several related problems, e.g., age estimation, gender classification, and ethnicity estimation can be solved altogether. This is the first time that the kernel PLS method is introduced and applied to solve a regression problem in computer vision with high accuracy. Experimental results on a very large database show that the KPLS is significantly better than the popular SVM method, and outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in human age estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995404.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"664","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous dimensionality reduction and human age estimation via kernel partial least squares regression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Databases","Kernel","Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Manifolds","Aging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","least squares approximations","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human age estimation","computer vision","pattern recognition","kernel partial least square regression","linear PLS method","simultaneous feature dimensionality reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous dimensionality reduction and human age estimation via kernel partial least squares regression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995404/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218766","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous dimensionality reduction and human age estimation via kernel partial least squares regression","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096639S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5995406,"authors":[{"name":"Kris M.

We address the novel task of discovering first-person action categories (which we call ego-actions) which can be useful for such tasks as video indexing and retrieval. In order to learn ego-action categories, we investigate the use of motion-based histograms and unsupervised learning algorithms to quickly cluster video content. Our approach assumes a completely unsupervised scenario, where labeled training videos are not available, videos are not pre-segmented and the number of ego-action categories are unknown. In our proposed framework we show that a stacked Dirichlet process mixture model can be used to automatically learn a motion histogram codebook and the set of ego-action categories. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on both in-house and public YouTube videos and demonstrate robust ego-action categorization across several sports genres. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art topic models with respect to both classification accuracy and computational speed. Preliminary results indicate that on average, the categorical content of a 10 minute video sequence can be indexed in under 5 seconds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995406/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12218768","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995406/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast unsupervised ego-action learning for first-person sports videos","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast unsupervised ego-action learning for first-person sports videos","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074086S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5995407,"authors":[{"name":"Heng Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Heng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405978500"},{"name":"Alexander Kl\u00e4ser","affiliation":["LEAR, LJK, INRIA Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Kl\u00e4ser","id":"37945000400"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["LEAR, LJK, INRIA Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"},{"name":"Cheng-Lin Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Cheng-Lin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280620800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995407","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1252,"citationCountPatent":20,"totalDownloads":8122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Videos","Tracking","Optical imaging","Training","Feature extraction","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","feature extraction","image classification","image motion analysis","image sampling","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action recognition","dense trajectories","feature trajectories","KLT tracker","SIFT descriptor matching","feature extraction","image classification","optical flow field","motion boundary histograms","camera motion","uncontrolled realistic videos","bag-of-features approach"]}],"abstract":"Feature trajectories have shown to be efficient for representing videos.

We sample dense points from each frame and track them based on displacement information from a dense optical flow field. Given a state-of-the-art optical flow algorithm, our trajectories are robust to fast irregular motions as well as shot boundaries. Additionally, dense trajectories cover the motion information in videos well. We, also, investigate how to design descriptors to encode the trajectory information. We introduce a novel descriptor based on motion boundary histograms, which is robust to camera motion. This descriptor consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art descriptors, in particular in uncontrolled realistic videos.

However, the best methods, such as those based on kernel-SVMs are highly computationally intensive. The problem of how to accelerate the evaluation process without decreasing accuracy is thus of current interest. In this paper, we deal with this problem by using the idea of ranking. We propose a cascaded architecture which using the ranking SVM generates an ordered set of proposals for windows containing object instances.

Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is robust, achieving higher overlap-recall values using fewer output proposals than the state-of-the-art. Our use of simple gradient features and linear convolution indicates that our method is also faster than the state-of-the-art.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995411/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12218773","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995411/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Proposal generation for object detection using cascaded ranking SVMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal generation for object detection using cascaded ranking SVMs","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071645S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5995415,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Yueh Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan","Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Yueh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37898993100"},{"name":"Tyng-Luh Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tyng-Luh","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280956300"},{"name":"Shang-Hong Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Hong","lastName":"Lai","id":"37270079400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995415","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":128,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1714},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Histograms","Image segmentation","Vocabulary","Minimization","Labeling","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image segmentation","minimisation","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-segmentation","unsupervised energy minimization model","pure unsupervised algorithm","MRF optimization model","co-saliency","submodular energy function","graph cuts"]}],"abstract":"We address two key issues of co-segmentation over multiple images. The first is whether a pure unsupervised algorithm can satisfactorily solve this problem. Without the user's guidance, segmenting the foregrounds implied by the common object is quite a challenging task, especially when substantial variations in the object's appearance, shape, and scale are allowed. The second issue concerns the efficiency if the technique can lead to practical uses. With these in mind, we establish an MRF optimization model that has an energy function with nice properties and can be shown to effectively resolve the two difficulties. Specifically, instead of relying on the user inputs, our approach introduces a co-saliency prior as the hint about possible foreground locations, and uses it to construct the MRF data terms. To complete the optimization framework, we include a novel global term that is more appropriate to co-segmentation, and results in a submodular energy function. The proposed model can thus be optimally solved by graph cuts. We demonstrate these advantages by testing our method on several benchmark datasets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From co-saliency to co-segmentation: An efficient and fully unsupervised energy minimization model","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995415","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995415.pdf","startPage":"2129","endPage":"2136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"From co-saliency to co-segmentation: An efficient and fully unsupervised energy minimization model","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995415/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218777","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From co-saliency to co-segmentation: An efficient and fully unsupervised energy minimization model","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075937S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995420,"authors":[{"name":"Lopamudra Mukherjee","affiliation":["Mathematics & Computer Science, University of Wisconsin, Whitewater, USA"],"firstName":"Lopamudra","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37418847100"},{"name":"Vikas Singh","affiliation":["Biostatistics & Med.

We further wish for our algorithm to offer scale invariance (foregrounds may have arbitrary sizes in different images) and the running time to increase (no more than) near linearly in the number of images in the set. What makes this setting particularly challenging is that even if we ignore the scale invariance desiderata, the Cosegmentation problem, as formalized in many recent papers (except), is already hard to solve optimally in the two image case. A straightforward extension of such models to multiple images leads to loose relaxations; and unless we impose a distributional assumption on the appearance model, existing mechanisms for image-pair-wise measurement of foreground appearance variations lead to significantly large problem sizes (even for moderate number of images). This paper presents a surprisingly easy to implement algorithm which performs well, and satisfies all requirements listed above (scale invariance, low computational requirements, and viability for the multiple image setting).

In this paper, we propose an efficient L1 tracker with minimum error bound and occlusion detection which we call Bounded Particle Resampling (BPR)-L1 tracker. First, the minimum error bound is quickly calculated from a linear least squares equation, and serves as a guide for particle resampling in a particle filter framework. Without loss of precision during resampling, most insignificant samples are removed before solving the computationally expensive \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization function.

Very promising results are presented on the AR Face Database, and we note that our method can be extended to a broad set of applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deformation and lighting insensitive metric for face recognition based on dense correspondences","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995431","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995431.pdf","startPage":"2353","endPage":"2360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A deformation and lighting insensitive metric for face recognition based on dense correspondences","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995431/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12257933","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deformation and lighting insensitive metric for face recognition based on dense correspondences","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110344S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5995432,"authors":[{"name":"Yunchao Gong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yunchao","lastName":"Gong","id":"37955360200"},{"name":"Svetlana Lazebnik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Svetlana","lastName":"Lazebnik","id":"37282648200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995432","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":611,"citationCountPatent":25,"totalDownloads":2365},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Quantization","Binary codes","Semantics","Encoding","Training","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","image coding","image retrieval","iterative methods","spectral analysis","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative quantization","Procrustean approach","learning binary code","learning similarity","large-scale image collection","zero-centered binary hypercube","multiclass spectral clustering","unsupervised data embedding","PCA","canonical correlation analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995432","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995432.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative quantization: A procrustean approach to learning binary codes","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of learning similarity-preserving binary codes for efficient retrieval in large-scale image collections.

Given an over-complete normal basis set (e.g., an image sequence or a collection of local spatio-temporal patches), we introduce the sparse reconstruction cost (SRC) over the normal dictionary to measure the normalness of the testing sample. To condense the size of the dictionary, a novel dictionary selection method is designed with sparsity consistency constraint. By introducing the prior weight of each basis during sparse reconstruction, the proposed SRC is more robust compared to other outlier detection criteria. Our method provides a unified solution to detect both local abnormal events (LAE) and global abnormal events (GAE). We further extend it to support online abnormal event detection by updating the dictionary incrementally. Experiments on three benchmark datasets and the comparison to the state-of-the-art methods validate the advantages of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995434","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995434.pdf","startPage":"3449","endPage":"3456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse reconstruction cost for abnormal event detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sparse reconstruction cost for abnormal event detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995434/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12257936","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995434/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse reconstruction cost for abnormal event detection","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10351S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"391","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5995437,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Yu Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuang-Yu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37405632900"},{"name":"Chu-Song Chen","affiliation":["Research Center of Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan","Research Center of Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chu-Song","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280738300"},{"name":"Yi-Ping Hung","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ping","lastName":"Hung","id":"37270491100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995437","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":186,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Face","Support vector machines","Databases","Kernel","Aging","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ordinal hyperplanes ranking algorithm","cost sensitivities","age estimation","OHRank","facial images","cost-sensitive property","classification costs","multiclass-based and regression-based approaches","ranking-based age estimation approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995437","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995437","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an ordinal hyperplane ranking algorithm called OHRank, which estimates human ages via facial images.

The key and most challenging issue for this task is how to balance the tradeoff between preserving the important contents and minimizing the visual distortions on the consistency of the image structure. In this paper we present a novel filtering-based technique to tackle this issue, called \u201dimportance filtering\u201d. Specifically, we first filter the image saliency guided by the image itself to achieve a structure-consistent importance map. We then use the pixel importance as the key constraint to compute the gradient map of pixel shifts from the original resolution to the target. Finally, we integrate the shift gradient across the image using a weighted filter to construct a smooth shift map and render the target image. The weight is again controlled by the pixel importance. The two filtering processes enforce to maintain the structural consistency and yet preserve the important contents in the target image. Furthermore, the simple nature of filter operations allows highly efficient implementation for real-time applications and easy extension to video retargeting, as the structural constraints from the original image naturally convey the temporal coherence between frames. The effectiveness and efficiency of our importance filtering algorithm are confirmed in extensive experiments.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995445","startPage":"89","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995445.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Importance filtering for image retargeting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995445/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Importance filtering for image retargeting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995445/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12257947","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Importance filtering for image retargeting","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052848S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5995446,"authors":[{"name":"Huixuan Tang","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Huixuan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37957939700"},{"name":"Neel Joshi","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Neel","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37270908500"},{"name":"Ashish Kapoor","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"37397699500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995446","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":139,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1614},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Distortion measurement","Transform coding","Histograms","Noise","Kernel","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image texture","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind measure","perceptual image quality","computer vision applications","groundtruth image","machine learning framework","subjective image quality scores","texture statistics"]}],"abstract":"It is often desirable to evaluate an image based on its quality. For many computer vision applications, a perceptually meaningful measure is the most relevant for evaluation; however, most commonly used measure do not map well to human judgements of image quality. A further complication of many existing image measure is that they require a reference image, which is often not available in practice. In this paper, we present a \u201cblind\u201d image quality measure, where potentially neither the groundtruth image nor the degradation process are known. Our method uses a set of novel low-level image features in a machine learning framework to learn a mapping from these features to subjective image quality scores. The image quality features stem from natural image measure and texture statistics. Experiments on a standard image quality benchmark dataset shows that our method outperforms the current state of art.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995446","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","startPage":"305","endPage":"312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning a blind measure of perceptual image quality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning a blind measure of perceptual image quality","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995446/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12257948","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995446/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning a blind measure of perceptual image quality","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080314S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995451,"authors":[{"name":"Devi Parikh","affiliation":["Toyota Technological Institute, Chicago (TTIC), USA"],"firstName":"Devi","lastName":"Parikh","id":"37294897500"},{"name":"Kristen Grauman","affiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Kristen","lastName":"Grauman","id":"37282612200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995451","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":131,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":833},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Humans","Manifolds","Vocabulary","Training","Support vector machines","Animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object recognition","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive discriminative vocabulary building","nameable attributes","human nameable visual attributes","object recognition","object labeled images","scene labeled images","human annotators","expert provided attributes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995451","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995451.pdf","startPage":"1681","endPage":"1688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactively building a discriminative vocabulary of nameable attributes","abstract":"Human-nameable visual attributes offer many advantages when used as mid-level features for object recognition, but existing techniques to gather relevant attributes can be inefficient (costing substantial effort or expertise) and/or insufficient (descriptive properties need not be discriminative).

However, compared to current RGB cameras, existing hyperspectral cameras are severely limited in spatial resolution. In this paper, we introduce a simple new technique for reconstructing a very high-resolution hyperspectral image from two readily obtained measurements: A lower-resolution hyper-spectral image and a high-resolution RGB image. Our approach is divided into two stages: We first apply an unmixing algorithm to the hyperspectral input, to estimate a basis representing reflectance spectra. We then use this representation in conjunction with the RGB input to produce the desired result. Our approach to unmixing is motivated by the spatial sparsity of the hyperspectral input, and casts the unmixing problem as the search for a factorization of the input into a basis and a set of maximally sparse coefficients. Experiments show that this simple approach performs reasonably well on both simulations and real data examples.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995457","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995457.pdf","startPage":"2329","endPage":"2336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution hyperspectral imaging via matrix factorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995457/","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution hyperspectral imaging via matrix factorization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12257958","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995457/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution hyperspectral imaging via matrix factorization","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066608S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5995458,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Fanelli","affiliation":["BIWI, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Fanelli","id":"37547850500"},{"name":"Juergen Gall","affiliation":["BIWI, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Gall","id":"37393846400"},{"name":"Luc Van Gool","affiliation":["ESAT-PSI, IBBT, KU Leuven, Belgium","BIWI, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Van Gool","id":"37277167600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995458","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":273,"citationCountPatent":24,"totalDownloads":3053},"abstract":"Fast and reliable algorithms for estimating the head pose are essential for many applications and higher-level face analysis tasks. We address the problem of head pose estimation from depth data, which can be captured using the ever more affordable 3D sensing technologies available today. To achieve robustness, we formulate pose estimation as a regression problem. While detecting specific face parts like the nose is sensitive to occlusions, learning the regression on rather generic surface patches requires enormous amount of training data in order to achieve accurate estimates. We propose to use random regression forests for the task at hand, given their capability to handle large training datasets. Moreover, we synthesize a great amount of annotated training data using a statistical model of the human face. In our experiments, we show that our approach can handle real data presenting large pose changes, partial occlusions, and facial expressions, even though it is trained only on synthetic neutral face data. We have thoroughly evaluated our system on a publicly available database on which we achieve state-of-the-art performance without having to resort to the graphics card.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995458.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"624","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time head pose estimation with random regression forests","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Nose","Three dimensional displays","Vegetation","Training","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","object detection","pose estimation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time head pose estimation","random regression forests","face analysis tasks","3D sensing technologies","specific face detection","large training datasets","statistical model","human face","partial occlusions","facial expressions","synthetic neutral face data","graphics card"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Real time head pose estimation with random regression forests","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995458/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12257959","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time head pose estimation with random regression forests","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07804S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"273","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5995459,"authors":[{"name":"Bolei Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Bolei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085668760"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375500"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995459","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1107},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995459","abstract":"In this paper, a Random Field Topic (RFT) model is proposed for semantic region analysis from motions of objects in crowded scenes. Different from existing approaches of learning semantic regions either from optical flows or from complete trajectories, our model assumes that fragments of trajectories (called tracklets) are observed in crowded scenes. It advances the existing Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, by integrating the Markov random fields (MRF) as prior to enforce the spatial and temporal coherence between tracklets during the learning process. Two kinds of MRF, pairwise MRF and the forest of randomly spanning trees, are defined. Another contribution of this model is to include sources and sinks as high-level semantic prior, which effectively improves the learning of semantic regions and the clustering of tracklets. Experiments on a large scale data set, which includes 40, 000+ tracklets collected from the crowded New York Grand Central station, show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both on qualitative results of learning semantic regions and on quantitative results of clustering tracklets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Trajectory","Hidden Markov

Most related research efforts focused on designing and learning effective descriptors to characterize a local interest point. However, how to identify stable local interest points is still a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a set of differential features, and based on them we adopt a data-driven approach to learn a ranking function to sort local interest points according to their stabilities across images containing the same visual objects. Compared with the handcrafted rule-based method used by the standard SIFT algorithm, our algorithm substantially improves the stability of detected local interest point on a very challenging benchmark dataset, in which images were generated under very different imaging conditions. Experimental results on the Oxford and PASCAL databases further demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm on both object image retrieval and category recognition.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995461","startPage":"1737","endPage":"1744","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995461.pdf","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank-SIFT: Learning to rank repeatable local interest points","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rank-SIFT: Learning to rank repeatable local interest points","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995461/","accessionNumber":"12257962","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995461/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank-SIFT: Learning to rank repeatable local interest points","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081749S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5995462,"authors":[{"name":"Sid Yingze Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, USA"],"firstName":"Sid Yingze","lastName":"Bao","id":"38242018200"},{"name":"Silvio Savarese","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, USA"],"firstName":"Silvio","lastName":"Savarese","id":"37298502600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995462","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1563},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Cameras","Detectors","Semantics","Object detection","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","feature extraction","image motion analysis","maximum likelihood estimation","natural scenes","object detection","optical radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["camera image parameter","3D location","scene point","2D image feature point","semantic structure from motion","geometrical constraint","SSFM","max-likelihood problem","semantic information","image feature","camera parameter","geometry estimation process","object detection","camera pose estimation","feature-point-based SFM algorithm","multiple image uncalibrated image","LiDAR car","street-view pedestrians","Kinect office desktop"]}],"abstract":"Conventional rigid structure from motion (SFM) addresses the problem of recovering the camera parameters (motion) and the 3D locations (structure) of scene points, given observed 2D image feature points. In this paper, we propose a new formulation called Semantic Structure From Motion (SSFM). In addition to the geometrical constraints provided by SFM, SSFM takes advantage of both semantic and geometrical properties associated with objects in the scene (Fig. 1). These properties allow us to recover not only the structure and motion but also the 3D locations, poses, and categories of objects in the scene. We cast this problem as a max-likelihood problem where geometry (cameras, points, objects) and semantic information (object classes) are simultaneously estimated. The key intuition is that, in addition to image features, the measurements of objects across views provide additional geometrical constraints that relate cameras and scene parameters. These constraints make the geometry estimation process more robust and, in turn, make object detection more accurate. Our framework has the unique ability to: i) estimate camera poses only from object detections, ii) enhance camera pose estimation, compared to feature-point-based SFM algorithms, iii) improve object detections given multiple un-calibrated images, compared to independently detecting objects in single images. Extensive quantitative results on three datasets - LiDAR cars, street-view pedestrians, and Kinect office desktop - verify our theoretical claims.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995462.pdf","endPage":"2032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic structure from motion","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995462","startPage":"2025","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Semantic structure from motion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995462/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12257963","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995462/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic structure from motion","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080449S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5995464,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Kneip","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Kneip","id":"37569040300"},{"name":"Davide Scaramuzza","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Scaramuzza","id":"37397688400"},{"name":"Roland Siegwart","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart","id":"37281398300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995464","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":223,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":2724},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Three dimensional displays","Closed-form solution","Polynomials","Accuracy","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computational complexity","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perspective-three-point problem","direct computation","camera position","2D-3D point","camera reference frame","P3P problem","parametrized camera pose","computational efficiency","RANSAC-outlier rejection step","nonlinear optimization"]}],"abstract":"The Perspective-Three-Point (P3P) problem aims at determining the position and orientation of the camera in the world reference frame from three 2D-3D point correspondences. This problem is known to provide up to four solutions that can then be disambiguated using a fourth point. All existing solutions attempt to first solve for the position of the points in the camera reference frame, and then compute the position and orientation of the camera in the world frame, which alignes the two point sets. In contrast, in this paper we propose a novel closed-form solution to the P3P problem, which computes the aligning transformation directly in a single stage, without the intermediate derivation of the points in the camera frame. This is made possible by introducing intermediate camera and world reference frames, and expressing their relative position and orientation using only two parameters. The projection of a world point into the parametrized camera pose then leads to two conditions and finally a quartic equation for finding up to four solutions for the parameter pair. A subsequent backsubstitution directly leads to the corresponding camera poses with respect to the world reference frame. We show that the proposed algorithm offers accuracy and precision comparable to a popular, standard, state-of-the-art approach but at much lower computational cost (15 times faster). Furthermore, it provides improved numerical stability and is less affected by degenerate configurations of the selected world points. The superior computational efficiency is particularly suitable for any RANSAC-outlier-rejection step, which is always recommended before applying PnP or non-linear optimization of the final solution.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995464","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995464.pdf","startPage":"2969","endPage":"2976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel parametrization of the perspective-three-point problem for a direct computation of absolute camera position and orientation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A novel parametrization of the perspective-three-point problem for a direct computation of absolute camera position and orientation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995464/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12257965","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995464/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel parametrization of the perspective-three-point problem for a direct computation of absolute camera position and orientation","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073131S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"223","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5995466,"authors":[{"name":"Girish Kulkarni","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Girish","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"37944281700"},{"name":"Visruth Premraj","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Visruth","lastName":"Premraj","id":"37944934900"},{"name":"Sagnik Dhar","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sagnik","lastName":"Dhar","id":"37971727700"},{"name":"Siming Li","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Siming","lastName":"Li","id":"37963753500"},{"name":"Yejin Choi","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yejin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37960943500"},{"name":"Alexander C Berg","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Alexander C","lastName":"Berg","id":"37282673400"},{"name":"Tamara L Berg","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tamara L","lastName":"Berg","id":"37270268400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995466","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":234,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":1688},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Labeling","Detectors","Computer vision","Natural languages","Visualization","Object detection","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","natural language processing","statistics","text analysis","visual languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baby talk","image description understanding","image description generation","visually descriptive language","computer vision researchers","natural language description generation","statistics","text data parsing"]}],"abstract":"We posit that visually descriptive language offers computer vision researchers both information about the world, and information about how people describe the world.

Our aesthetic quality estimation method explicitly predicts some of the possible image cues that a human might use to evaluate an image and then uses them in a discriminative approach. These cues or high level describable image attributes fall into three broad types: 1) compositional attributes related to image layout or configuration, 2) content attributes related to the objects or scene types depicted, and 3) sky-illumination attributes related to the natural lighting conditions.

We demonstrate experimentally that it outperforms purely visual distances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual and semantic similarity in ImageNet","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995474","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995474.pdf","startPage":"1777","endPage":"1784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Visual and semantic similarity in ImageNet","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995474/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12257975","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual and semantic similarity in ImageNet","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065008S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5995477,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanqing Lin","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Lin","id":"37963628900"},{"name":"Fengjun Lv","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fengjun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37331920100"},{"name":"Shenghuo Zhu","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shenghuo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37337370100"},{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290776300"},{"name":"Timothee Cour","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Timothee","lastName":"Cour","id":"37418657200"},{"name":"Kai Yu","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Yu","id":"37403617400"},{"name":"Liangliang Cao","affiliation":["Beckman Institute, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Liangliang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37407515600"},{"name":"Thomas Huang","affiliation":["Beckman Institute, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275421800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995477","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":233,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":5777},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Support vector machines","Feature extraction","Training","Training data","Image coding","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","gradient methods","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","stochastic processes","support vector machines","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large scale image classification","fast feature extraction","SVM training","ImageNet dataset","medium scale datasets","classifier training","Hadoop scheme","parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Most research efforts on image classification so far have been focused on medium-scale datasets, which are often defined as datasets that can fit into the memory of a desktop (typically 4G~48G). There are two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training data and converges very fast-typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995477","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995477.pdf","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale image classification: Fast feature extraction and SVM training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995477/","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale image classification: Fast feature extraction and SVM training","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12257978","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995477/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale image classification: Fast feature extraction and SVM training","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068474S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995478,"authors":[{"name":"Weisheng Dong","affiliation":["Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37396032700"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["WVU, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280864900"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["HK PolyTechnology University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280177000"},{"name":"Guangming Shi","affiliation":["Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Shi","id":"37267099300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995478","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":263,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":3694},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Noise reduction","PSNR","Clustering algorithms","Image denoising","Manifolds","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image representation","image texture","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparsity-based image denoising","dictionary learning","structural clustering","local image models","nonlocal image models","natural images","image source","self-similarity","clustering-based sparse representation","double-header-optimization problem","surrogate-function based iterative shrinkage solution","probabilistic interpretation","regular texture images","BM3D"]}],"abstract":"Where does the sparsity in image signals come from?

Restoring blurred pictures is challenging because both the blur kernel and the sharp image are unknown, which makes this problem severely underconstrained. In this work, we estimate camera shake by analyzing edges in the image, effectively constructing the Radon transform of the kernel. Building upon this result, we describe two algorithms for estimating spatially invariant blur kernels. In the first method, we directly invert the transform, which is computationally efficient since it is not necessary to also estimate the latent sharp image. This approach is well suited for scenes with a diversity of edges, such as man-made environments. In the second method, we incorporate the Radon transform within the MAP estimation framework to jointly estimate the kernel and the image. While more expensive, this algorithm performs well on a broader variety of scenes, even when fewer edges can be observed. Our experiments show that our algorithms achieve comparable results to the state of the art in general and produce superior outputs on man-made scenes and photos degraded by a small kernel.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","startPage":"241","endPage":"248","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995479.pdf","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blur kernel estimation using the radon transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Image edge detection","Transforms","Estimation","Noise","Image color analysis","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image restoration","maximum likelihood estimation","Radon transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Radon transform","camera shake","photographs","blurred picture restoration","spatially invariant blur kernel estimation","latent sharp image","edge diversity","man-made environment","MAP estimation framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Blur kernel estimation using the radon transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995479/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995479/","accessionNumber":"12257980","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blur kernel estimation using the radon transform","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055617S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5995483,"authors":[{"name":"Hanxi Li","affiliation":["Canberra Research Laboratory, NICTA, ACT, Australia","Australian National University, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Hanxi","lastName":"Li","id":"37407168900"},{"name":"Chunhua Shen","affiliation":["Australian Center of Visual Technologies, University of Adelaide, SA, Australia","Canberra Research Laboratory, NICTA, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Shen","id":"37274255300"},{"name":"Qinfeng Shi","affiliation":["Australian Center of Visual Technologies, University of Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Qinfeng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37400907600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995483","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":193,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3546},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Target tracking","Real time systems","Compressed sensing","Robustness","Noise","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computational complexity","image matching","image representation","image sequences","iterative methods","object tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["\u21131 tracker","sparse representation","object tracking","\u21131 norm minimisation","computational complexity","real-time processing scenario","real-time compressive sensing visual tracking accuracy","signal recovery power","dimensionality reduction","customized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","CS tracking","stationary camera","refined tracker","CS-based background model","CSBM-equipped tracker","RTCST-B","video sequence","success probability tracking"]}],"abstract":"The \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n tracker obtains robustness by seeking a sparse representation of the tracking object via \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n norm minimization.

It is difficult how to appropriately measure the similarity between human faces under significantly different settings (e.g., pose, illumination, and expression). In this paper, we propose a new model, called \u201cAssociate-Predict\u201d (AP) model, to address this issue. The associate-predict model is built on an extra generic identity data set, in which each identity contains multiple images with large intra-personal variation. When considering two faces under significantly different settings (e.g., non-frontal and frontal), we first \u201cassociate\u201d one input face with alike identities from the generic identity date set. Using the associated faces, we generatively \u201cpredict\u201d the appearance of one input face under the setting of another input face, or discriminatively \u201cpredict\u201d the likelihood whether two input faces are from the same person or not. We call the two proposed prediction methods as \u201cappearance-prediction\u201d and \u201clikelihood-prediction\u201d. By leveraging an extra data set (\u201cmemory\u201d) and the \u201cassociate-predict\u201d model, the intra-personal variation can be effectively handled. To improve the generalization ability of our model, we further add a switching mechanism - we directly compare the appearances of two faces if they have close intra-personal settings; otherwise, we use the associate-predict model for the recognition. Experiments on two public face benchmarks (Multi-PIE and LFW) demonstrated that our final model can substantially improve the performance of most existing face recognition methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An associate-predict model for face recognition","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995494","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995494.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An associate-predict model for face recognition","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995494/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12257995","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An associate-predict model for face recognition","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087723S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995495,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiming He","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kaiming","lastName":"He","id":"37085360867"},{"name":"Christoph Rhemann","affiliation":["University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Rhemann","id":"37398257300"},{"name":"Carsten Rother","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Rother","id":"37326487100"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37407525400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995495","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":143,"citationCountPatent":20,"totalDownloads":1475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Approximation algorithms","Cost function","Sampling methods","Approximation methods","Coherence","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","feature extraction","image colour analysis","image sampling","randomised algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sampling method","alpha matting","image extraction","background color","sample selection process","computational complexity","randomized algorithm","patch matching","high-quality matting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995495","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995495.pdf","startPage":"2049","endPage":"2056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A global sampling method for alpha matting","abstract":"Alpha matting refers to the problem of softly extracting the foreground from an image. Given a trimap (specifying known foreground/background and unknown pixels), a straightforward way to compute the alpha value is to sample some known foreground and background colors for each unknown pixel. Existing sampling-based matting methods often collect samples near the unknown pixels only. They fail if good samples cannot be found nearby. In this paper, we propose a global sampling method that uses all samples available in the image. Our global sample set avoids missing good samples. A simple but effective cost function is defined to tackle the ambiguity in the sample selection process. To handle the computational complexity introduced by the large number of samples, we pose the sampling task as a correspondence problem. The correspondence search is efficiently achieved by generalizing a randomized algorithm previously designed for patch matching[3]. A variety of experiments show that our global sampling method produces both visually and quantitatively high-quality matting results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995495/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12257996","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A global sampling method for alpha matting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A global sampling method for alpha matting","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069762S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5995496,"authors":[{"name":"Quoc V.

How to precisely label these images is critical to image retrieval. However, traditional image-level tagging methods may become less effective because global image matching approaches can hardly cope with the diversity and arbitrariness of Web image content. This raises an urgent need for the fine-grained tagging schemes. In this work, we study how to establish mapping between tags and image regions, i.e. localize tags to image regions, so as to better depict and index the content of images. We propose the spatial group sparse coding (SGSC) by extending the robust encoding ability of group sparse coding with spatial correlations among training regions. We present spatial correlations in a two-dimensional image space and design group-specific spatial kernels to produce a more interpretable regularizer. Further we propose a joint version of the SGSC model which is able to simultaneously encode a group of intrinsically related regions within a test image. An effective algorithm is developed to optimize the objective function of the Joint SGSC. The tag localization task is conducted by propagating tags from sparsely selected groups of regions to the target regions according to the reconstruction coefficients. Extensive experiments on three public image datasets illustrate that our proposed models achieve great performance improvements over the state-of-the-art method in the tag localization task.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995499","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Encoding","Correlation","Image reconstruction","Image coding","Image segmentation","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","image coding","image matching","image reconstruction","image retrieval","Internet","social networking (online)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tag localization","spatial correlation","joint group sparsity","social images","image retrieval","image-level tagging method","image matching","Web image content","fine-grained tagging scheme","image regions","spatial group sparse coding","robust encoding ability","two-dimensional image space","group-specific spatial kernels","joint SGSC","reconstruction coefficients","public image datasets"]}],"publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995499.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995499","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tag localization with spatial correlations and joint group sparsity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995499/","displayDocTitle":"Tag localization with spatial correlations and joint group sparsity","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258000","htmlLink":"/document/5995499/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tag localization with spatial correlations and joint group sparsity","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088573S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995500,"authors":[{"name":"Yiqun Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Software Engineering, University of Western Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Yiqun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37403239300"},{"name":"Ajmal S.

In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust algorithm for image set classification. An image set is represented as a triplet: a number of image samples, their mean and an affine hull model. The affine hull model is used to account for unseen appearances in the form of affine combinations of sample images. We introduce a novel between-set distance called Sparse Approximated Nearest Point (SANP) distance. Unlike existing methods, the dissimilarity of two sets is measured as the distance between their nearest points, which can be sparsely approximated from the image samples of their respective set. Different from standard sparse modeling of a single image, this novel sparse formulation for the image set enforces sparsity on the sample coefficients rather than the model coefficients and jointly optimizes the nearest points as well as their sparse approximations. A convex formulation for searching the optimal SANP between two sets is proposed and the accelerated proximal gradient method is adapted to efficiently solve this optimization. Experimental evaluation was performed on the Honda, MoBo and Youtube datasets. Comparison with existing techniques shows that our method consistently achieves better results.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995500.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse approximated nearest points for image set classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Data models","Convergence","Joints","Adaptation models","Gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine transforms","approximation theory","convex programming","gradient methods","image classification","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse approximated nearest points","image set classification","image set representation","affine hull model","between-set distance","image samples","sparse modeling","convex formulation","optimal SANP searching","accelerated proximal gradient method","optimization","Honda datasets","MoBo datasets","Youtube datasets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sparse approximated nearest points for image set classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258001","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse approximated nearest points for image set classification","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0791.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061701S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5995504,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Sanchez","affiliation":["Textual and Visual Pattern Analysis (TVPA) group, Xerox Research Centre Europe, France"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Sanchez","id":"37533127600"},{"name":"Florent Perronnin","affiliation":["Textual and Visual Pattern Analysis (TVPA) group, Xerox Research Centre Europe, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Perronnin","id":"37285162600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995504","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":156,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":1945},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-dimensional signature compression for large-scale image classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995504","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Training","Image coding","Encoding","Kernel","Data compression","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","image classification","image coding","learning (artificial intelligence)","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","signature compression","data compression","lossy compression strategy","dimensionality reduction technique","hash kernel technique","encoding technique","product quantizers","lM Flickr images","classifier learning","scalable training algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We address image classification on a large-scale, i.e. when a large number of images and classes are involved. First, we study classification accuracy as a function of the image signature dimensionality and the training set size. We show experimentally that the larger the training set, the higher the impact of the dimensionality on the accuracy. In other words, high-dimensional signatures are important to obtain state-of-the-art results on large datasets. Second, we tackle the problem of data compression on very large signatures (on the order of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup>\n dimensions) using two lossy compression strategies: a dimensionality reduction technique known as the hash kernel and an encoding technique based on product quantizers. We explain how the gain in storage can be traded against a loss in accuracy and/or an increase in CPU cost. We report results on two large databases - ImageNet and a dataset of lM Flickr images - showing that we can reduce the storage of our signatures by a factor 64 to 128 with little loss in accuracy. Integrating the decompression in the classifier learning yields an efficient and scalable training algorithm. On ILSVRC2010 we report a 74.3% accuracy at top-5, which corresponds to a 2.5% absolute improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art. On a subset of 10K classes of ImageNet we report a top-1 accuracy of 16.7%, a relative improvement of 160% with respect to the state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995504","startPage":"1665","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995504.pdf","endPage":"1672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995504/","displayDocTitle":"High-dimensional signature compression for large-scale image classification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995504/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12258005","publicationDate":"June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-dimensional signature compression for large-scale image classification","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064256S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995506,"authors":[{"name":"Naila Murray","affiliation":["Computer Vision Center, Computer Science Department, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Naila","lastName":"Murray","id":"37950311500"},{"name":"Maria Vanrell","affiliation":["Computer Vision Center, Computer Science Department, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Vanrell","id":"37353111600"},{"name":"Xavier Otazu","affiliation":["Computer Vision Center, Computer Science Department, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Otazu","id":"37371111000"},{"name":"C.

However, integrating spatial information and justifying the choice of various parameter values remain open problems. In this paper we show that an efficient model of color appearance in human vision, which contains a principled selection of parameters as well as an innate spatial pooling mechanism, can be generalized to obtain a saliency model that outperforms state-of-the-art models. Scale integration is achieved by an inverse wavelet transform over the set of scale-weighted center-surround responses. The scale-weighting function (termed ECSF) has been optimized to better replicate psychophysical data on color appearance, and the appropriate sizes of the center-surround inhibition windows have been determined by training a Gaussian Mixture Model on eye-fixation data, thus avoiding ad-hoc parameter selection. Additionally, we conclude that the extension of a color appearance model to saliency estimation adds to the evidence for a common low-level visual front-end for different visual tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995506.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"440","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency estimation using a non-parametric low-level vision model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Computational modeling","Wavelet transforms","Predictive models","Visualization","Brightness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology","biology computing","colour vision","computer vision","Gaussian processes","visual perception","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saliency estimation","nonparametric low-level vision model","convolution","center-surround mechanism","saliency map","human vision","innate spatial pooling mechanism","scale integration","inverse wavelet transform","scale-weighted center-surround response","scale-weighting function","center-surround inhibition windows","Gaussian mixture model","eye-fixation data","ad hoc parameter selection","color appearance model","low-level visual front-end","visual task"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Saliency estimation using a non-parametric low-level vision model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995506/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258007","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency estimation using a non-parametric low-level vision model","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064186S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995508,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Brutzer","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Group, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Brutzer","id":"37945339000"},{"name":"Benjamin H\u00f6ferlin","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Group, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"H\u00f6ferlin","id":"37571601300"},{"name":"Gunther Heidemann","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Group, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Gunther","lastName":"Heidemann","id":"37266102100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995508","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":349,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":8083},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video surveillance","Adaptation models","Image color analysis","Noise","Delta modulation","Lighting","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["background subtraction","video surveillance","automatic video analysis","ground truth annotations","shadow masks"]}],"abstract":"Background subtraction is one of the key techniques for automatic video analysis, especially in the domain of video surveillance.

To explain short-term occlusions, when local information is sufficient to distinguish objects, the process links trajectory segments through a series of optimal bipartite-graph matches. To resolve long-term occlusions, when global information is needed to characterize objects, the linking process computes a logarithmic approximation solution to the set cover problem. If multiple views are available, our method builds a track graph, independently for each view, and then simultaneously links track segments from each graph, solving a joint set cover problem for which a logarithmic approximation also exists. Through experiments on different datasets, we show that our proposed linear and integer optimization techniques make the track graph a particularly useful tool for tracking large groups of individuals in images.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995515.pdf","startPage":"1185","endPage":"1192","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient track linking methods for track graphs using network-flow and set-cover techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joining processes","Tracking","Radar tracking","TV","Trajectory","Optimization","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","hidden feature removal","inference mechanisms","integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["track linking methods","track graphs","network-flow techniques","set-cover techniques","occlusion reasoning","process links trajectory segments","optimal bipartite-graph","logarithmic approximation","integer optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient track linking methods for track graphs using network-flow and set-cover techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995515/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258016","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient track linking methods for track graphs using network-flow and set-cover techniques","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062932S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5995516,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Deng","affiliation":["Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Deng","id":"38307037500"},{"name":"Alexander C.

The core novel contribution is an approach that can exploit prior knowledge of a semantic hierarchy. When semantic labels and a hierarchy relating them are available during training, significant improvements over the state of the art in similar image retrieval are attained. While some of this advantage comes from the ability to use additional information, experiments exploring a special case where no additional data is provided, show the new approach can still outperform OASIS, the current state of the art for similarity learning. Exploiting hierarchical relationships is most important for larger scale problems, where scalability becomes crucial. The proposed learning approach is fundamentally parallelizable and as a result scales more easily than previous work. An additional contribution is a novel hashing scheme (for bilinear similarity on vectors of probabilities, optionally taking into account hierarchy) that is able to reduce the computational cost of retrieval.

Such general-purpose detection of occlusion regions is difficult and important because one-to-one correspondence of imaged scene points is needed for many tracking, video segmentation, and reconstruction algorithms. Our hypothesis is that an effective trained occlusion detector can be generated on the basis of i) a broad spectrum of visual features, and ii) representative but synthetic training sequences. By using a Random Forest based framework for feature selection and training, we found that the proposed feature set was sufficient to frequently assign a high probability of occlusion to just the pixels that were indeed becoming occluded. Our extensive experiments on many sequences support this finding, and while accuracy is certainly still scene-dependent, the proposed classifier could be a useful preprocessing step to exploit temporal information in video.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995517","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995517.pdf","startPage":"2161","endPage":"2168","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to find occlusion regions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning to find occlusion regions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995517/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258018","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995517/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to find occlusion regions","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108517S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5995518,"authors":[{"name":"Junfeng He","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"He","id":"37962353100"},{"name":"Shih-Fu Chang","affiliation":["Dolby Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shih-Fu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37281064000"},{"name":"Regunathan Radhakrishnan","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Regunathan","lastName":"Radhakrishnan","id":"37287594600"},{"name":"Claus Bauer","affiliation":["Dolby Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Claus","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37414714600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995518","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":539},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Kernel","Optimization","Complexity theory","Joints","Equations","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","file organisation","image retrieval","information retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact hashing","joint optimization","search accuracy","approximate nearest neighborhoods","large scale machine learning","machine vision applications","compact codes","large scale similarity search","hashing methods","search time","scalable hashing algorithm","compact hash codes","similarity function"]}],"abstract":"Similarity search, namely, finding approximate nearest neighborhoods, is the core of many large scale machine learning or vision applications. Recently, many research results demonstrate that hashing with compact codes can achieve promising performance for large scale similarity search. However, most of the previous hashing methods with compact codes only model and optimize the search accuracy. Search time, which is an important factor for hashing in practice, is usually not addressed explicitly. In this paper, we develop a new scalable hashing algorithm with joint optimization of search accuracy and search time simultaneously. Our method generates compact hash codes for data of general formats with any similarity function. We evaluate our method using diverse data sets up to 1 million samples (e.g., web images). Our comprehensive results show the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995518","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995518.pdf","startPage":"753","endPage":"760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact hashing with joint optimization of search accuracy and time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995518/","displayDocTitle":"Compact hashing with joint optimization of search accuracy and time","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258019","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995518/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact hashing with joint optimization of search accuracy and time","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133458S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995519,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407552000"},{"name":"Duan Tran","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Duan","lastName":"Tran","id":"37396168600"},{"name":"Zicheng Liao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Zicheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37591746700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995519","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":598},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995519","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Torso","Head","Joints","Training","Legged locomotion","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","physiological models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical poselets","human parsing","part-based model","rigid parts","human anatomy","structured model","max-margin framework"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995519","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995519.pdf","startPage":"1705","endPage":"1712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning hierarchical poselets for human parsing","abstract":"We consider the problem of human parsing with part-based models. Most previous work in part-based models only considers rigid parts (e.g. torso, head, half limbs) guided by human anatomy. We argue that this representation of parts is not necessarily appropriate for human parsing. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical poselets-a new representation for human parsing. Hierarchical poselets can be rigid parts, but they can also be parts that cover large portions of human bodies (e.g. torso + left arm). In the extreme case, they can be the whole bodies. We develop a structured model to organize poselets in a hierarchical way and learn the model parameters in a max-margin framework.

Then the traditional local spatial filter is extended to the non-local range filter that convolves an image over the non-local ranges of pixels. In this framework, we propose a gradient-based discriminative learning method to learn the potential functions and non-local range filter bank. As the gradients of loss function with respect to model parameters are explicitly computed, efficient gradient-based optimization methods are utilized to train the proposed model.

However, many common forms of image prior used in this setting have a major drawback in that the minimum of the resulting cost function does not correspond to the true sharp solution. Accordingly, a range of additional methods are needed to yield good results (Bayesian methods, adaptive cost functions, alpha-matte extraction and edge localization). In this paper we introduce a new type of image regularization which gives lowest cost for the true sharp image. This allows a very simple cost formulation to be used for the blind deconvolution model, obviating the need for additional methods. Due to its simplicity the algorithm is fast and very robust. We demonstrate our method on real images with both spatially invariant and spatially varying blur.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995521/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12258022","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995521/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Blind deconvolution using a normalized sparsity measure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind deconvolution using a normalized sparsity measure","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088338S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"515","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5995523,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Jae Lee","affiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Yong Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539808200"},{"name":"Kristen Grauman","affiliation":["University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Kristen","lastName":"Grauman","id":"37282612200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995523","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":708},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Context modeling","Visualization","Data models","Kernel","Clustering algorithms","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image retrieval","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-paced visual category discovery","visual complexity","generic objectness","unlabeled images","image retrieval"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995523","abstract":"Objects vary in their visual complexity, yet existing discovery methods perform \u201cbatch\u201d clustering, paying equal attention to all instances simultaneously - regardless of the strength of their appearance or context cues.

We propose a fully unsupervised dynamic sparse coding approach for detecting unusual events in videos based on online sparse re-constructibility of query signals from an atomically learned event dictionary, which forms a sparse coding bases. Based on an intuition that usual events in a video are more likely to be reconstructible from an event dictionary, whereas unusual events are not, our algorithm employs a principled convex optimization formulation that allows both a sparse reconstruction code, and an online dictionary to be jointly inferred and updated. Our algorithm is completely un-supervised, making no prior assumptions of what unusual events may look like and the settings of the cameras. The fact that the bases dictionary is updated in an online fashion as the algorithm observes more data, avoids any issues with concept drift. Experimental results on hours of real world surveillance video and several Youtube videos show that the proposed algorithm could reliably locate the unusual events in the video sequence, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995524","startPage":"3313","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995524.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995524","endPage":"3320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online detection of unusual events in videos via dynamic sparse coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Online detection of unusual events in videos via dynamic sparse coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995524/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12258025","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online detection of unusual events in videos via dynamic sparse coding","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077655S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5995528,"authors":[{"name":"Yimeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Yimeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599044600"},{"name":"Zhaoyin Jia","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhaoyin","lastName":"Jia","id":"37398496900"},{"name":"Tsuhan Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Tsuhan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276683300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995528","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":213,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1801},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995528","abstract":"The most popular approach to large scale image retrieval is based on the bag-of-visual-word (BoV) representation of images. The spatial information is usually re-introduced as a post-processing step to re-rank the retrieved images, through a spatial verification like RANSAC. Since the spatial verification techniques are computationally expensive, they can be applied only to the top images in the initial ranking. In this paper, we propose an approach that can encode more spatial information into BoV representation and that is efficient enough to be applied to large-scale databases. Other works pursuing the same purpose have proposed exploring the word co-occurrences in the neighborhood areas. Our approach encodes more spatial information through the geometry-preserving visual phrases (GVP). In addition to co-occurrences, the GVP method also captures the local and long-range spatial layouts of the words. Our GVP based searching algorithm increases little memory usage or computational time compared to the BoV method. Moreover, we show that our approach can also be integrated to the min-hash method to improve its retrieval accuracy. The experiment results on Oxford 5K and Flicker 1M dataset show that our approach outperforms the BoV method even following a RANSAC verification.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","startPage":"809","endPage":"816","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995528.pdf","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image retrieval with geometry-preserving visual phrases","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Vocabulary","Artificial intelligence","Layout","Histograms","Image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image retrieval","geometry-preserving visual phrase","bag-of-visual-word representation","image representation","RANSAC spatial verification","GVP based searching algorithm","min-hash method","Oxford 5K dataset","Flicker 1M dataset","random sample consensus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Image retrieval with geometry-preserving visual phrases","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995528/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995528/","accessionNumber":"12258029","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image retrieval with geometry-preserving visual phrases","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060722S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5995530,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Vicente","affiliation":["University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Vicente","id":"37411767000"},{"name":"Carsten Rother","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Rother","id":"37326487100"},{"name":"Vladimir Kolmogorov","affiliation":["University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Kolmogorov","id":"37279665800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995530","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":181,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1274},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995530","abstract":"Cosegmentation is typically defined as the task of jointly segmenting \u201csomething similar\u201d in a given set of images.

In this way, we are able to achieve excellent results on the recently introduced iCoseg dataset, which contains small sets of images of either the same object instance or similar objects of the same class. The challenge of this dataset lies in the extreme changes in viewpoint, lighting, and object deformations within each set. We are able to considerably outperform several competitors. To achieve this performance, we borrow recent ideas from object recognition: the use of powerful features extracted from a pool of candidate object-like segmentations. We believe that our work will be beneficial to several application areas, such as image retrieval.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995530","startPage":"2217","endPage":"2224","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995530.pdf","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object cosegmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Proposals","Histograms","Training","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image segmentation","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object cosegmentation","similarity measure","iCoseg dataset","viewpoint change","lighting change","object deformation","object recognition","features extraction","object-like segmentations","image retrieval"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Object cosegmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995530/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258031","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object cosegmentation","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063294S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5995539,"authors":[{"name":"Masashi Nishiyama","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masashi","lastName":"Nishiyama","id":"37602632600"},{"name":"Takahiro Okabe","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Okabe","id":"37276328500"},{"name":"Imari Sato","affiliation":["National Institute of Information, Japan"],"firstName":"Imari","lastName":"Sato","id":"37266733600"},{"name":"Yoichi Sato","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichi","lastName":"Sato","id":"37276345600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995539","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1523},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995539","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Color","Histograms","Computational modeling","Feature extraction","Object recognition","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image colour analysis","photography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photograph aesthetic quality classification","color pattern","color arrangement","color variation","photo color harmony","bags-of-color-patterns method","aesthetic quality score","blur feature","edge feature","saliency feature"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995539","endPage":"40","startPage":"33","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995539.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aesthetic quality classification of photographs based on color harmony","abstract":"Aesthetic quality classification plays an important role in how people organize large photo collections. In particular, color harmony is a key factor in the various aspects that determine the perceived quality of a photo, and it should be taken into account to improve the performance of automatic aesthetic quality classification. However, the existing models of color harmony take only simple color patterns into consideration-e.g., patches consisting of a few colors-and thus cannot be used to assess photos with complicated color arrangements. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of evaluating the color harmony of photos with a particular focus on aesthetic quality classification. A key point is that a photograph can be seen as a collection of local regions with color variations that are relatively simple. This led us to develop a method for assessing the aesthetic quality of a photo based on the photo's color harmony. We term the method `bags-of-color-patterns.' Results of experiments on a large photo collection with user-provided aesthetic quality scores show that our aesthetic quality classification method, which explicitly takes into account the color harmony of a photo, outperforms the existing methods. Results also show that the classification performance is improved by combining our color harmony feature with blur, edges, and saliency features that reflect the aesthetics of the photos.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995539/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995539/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12258040","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Aesthetic quality classification of photographs based on color harmony","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aesthetic quality classification of photographs based on color harmony","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057152S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995542,"authors":[{"name":"Dikpal Reddy","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Dikpal","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37409393000"},{"name":"Ashok Veeraraghavan","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Veeraraghavan","id":"37282938900"},{"name":"Rama Chellappa","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Rama","lastName":"Chellappa","id":"37274537000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995542","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":116,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1505},"abstract":"We describe an imaging architecture for compressive video sensing termed programmable pixel compressive camera (P2C2). P2C2 allows us to capture fast phenomena at frame rates higher than the camera sensor. In P2C2, each pixel has an independent shutter that is modulated at a rate higher than the camera frame-rate. The observed intensity at a pixel is an integration of the incoming light modulated by its specific shutter. We propose a reconstruction algorithm that uses the data from P2C2 along with additional priors about videos to perform temporal super-resolution. We model the spatial redundancy of videos using sparse representations and the temporal redundancy using brightness constancy constraints inferred via optical flow. We show that by modeling such spatio-temporal redundancies in a video volume, one can faithfully recover the underlying high-speed video frames from the observed low speed coded video. The imaging architecture and the reconstruction algorithm allows us to achieve temporal super-resolution without loss in spatial resolution. We implement a prototype of P2C2 using an LCOS modulator and recover several videos at 200 fps using a 25 fps camera.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995542.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P2C2: Programmable pixel compressive camera for high speed imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Spatial resolution","Liquid crystal on silicon","Brightness","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image sequences","imaging","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["P2C2","programmable pixel compressive camera","high speed imaging","imaging architecture","compressive video sensing","camera sensor","independent shutter","reconstruction algorithm","temporal super-resolution","sparse representation","temporal redundancy","brightness constancy constraint","optical flow","spatio-temporal redundancies","high-speed video frames","low speed coded video"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"P2C2: Programmable pixel compressive camera for high speed imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995542/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258043","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P2C2: Programmable pixel compressive camera for high speed imaging","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"0974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062074S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5995552,"authors":[{"name":"Changchang Wu","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Changchang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37402225100"},{"name":"Sameer Agarwal","affiliation":["Google, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37325991600"},{"name":"Brian Curless","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Curless","id":"37333354000"},{"name":"Steven M.

These results are demonstrated on the publicly available YaleB and AR face datasets but have implications for the application of Compressive Sensing more broadly.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995556","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995556.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Is face recognition really a Compressive Sensing problem?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995556/","displayDocTitle":"Is face recognition really a Compressive Sensing problem?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258057","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995556/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is face recognition really a Compressive Sensing problem?","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084545S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995558,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyi Cui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Xinyi","lastName":"Cui","id":"37953000700"},{"name":"Qingshan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Qingshan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277488200"},{"name":"Mingchen Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mingchen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37070988800"},{"name":"Dimitris N.

This approach effectively models group activities based on social behavior analysis. Different from previous work that uses independent local features, our method explores the relationships between the current behavior state of a subject and its actions. An interaction energy potential function is proposed to represent the current behavior state of a subject, and velocity is used as its actions. Our method does not depend on human detection or segmentation, so it is robust to detection errors. Instead, tracked spatio-temporal interest points are able to provide a good estimation of modeling group interaction. SVM is used to find abnormal events. We evaluate our algorithm in two datasets: UMN and BEHAVE.

When comparing a frontal image of a face to a near profile image, one must cope with large occlusions, non-linear correspondences, and significant changes in appearance due to viewpoint. Stereo matching has been used to handle these problems, but performance of this approach degrades with large pose changes. We show that some of this difficulty is due to the effect that foreshortening of slanted surfaces has on window-based matching methods, which are needed to provide robustness to lighting change. We address this problem by designing a new, dynamic programming stereo algorithm that accounts for surface slant. We show that on the CMU PIE dataset this method results in significant improvements in recognition performance.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995559","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995559.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","startPage":"537","endPage":"544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-baseline stereo for face recognition with large pose variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wide-baseline stereo for face recognition with large pose variation","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995559/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258059","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995559/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-baseline stereo for face recognition with large pose variation","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091009S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5995560,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo F.U.

While several recent studies explored the applicability of discriminant analysis on such manifolds, the conventional formalism of discriminant analysis suffers from not considering the local structure of the data. We propose a discriminant analysis approach on Grassmannian manifolds, based on a graph-embedding framework. We show that by introducing within-class and between-class similarity graphs to characterise intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, the geometrical structure of data can be exploited. Experiments on several image datasets (PIE, BANCA, MoBo, ETH-80) show that the proposed algorithm obtains considerable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to three recent methods: Grassmann Discriminant Analysis (GDA), Kernel GDA, and the kernel version of Affine Hull Image Set Distance. We further propose a Grassmannian kernel, based on canonical correlation between subspaces, which can increase discrimination accuracy when used in combination with previous Grassmannian kernels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258064","htmlLink":"/document/5995564/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Graph embedding discriminant analysis on Grassmannian manifolds for improved image set matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph embedding discriminant analysis on Grassmannian manifolds for improved image set matching","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076318S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995566,"authors":[{"name":"Lior Wolf","affiliation":["Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Lior","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37411189600"},{"name":"Tal Hassner","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, Open University of Israel, Israel"],"firstName":"Tal","lastName":"Hassner","id":"37393684300"},{"name":"Itay Maoz","affiliation":["Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"],"firstName":"Itay","lastName":"Maoz","id":"37945296400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995566","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":633,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":3216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Face","Benchmark testing","Face recognition","Training","Databases","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image matching","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","unconstrained video","labeled video","YouTube Faces database","matched background similarity"]}],"abstract":"Recognizing faces in unconstrained videos is a task of mounting importance.

State-of-the-art methods learn appearance based models requiring tedious collection and annotation of large data corpora. Also, obtaining data sets representing all relevant variations with sufficient accuracy for the intended application domain at hand is often a non-trivial task. Therefore this paper investigates how 3D shape models from computer graphics can be leveraged to ease training data generation. In particular we employ a rendering-based reshaping method in order to generate thousands of synthetic training samples from only a few persons and views. We evaluate our data generation method for two different people detection models. Our experiments on a challenging multi-view dataset indicate that the data from as few as eleven persons suffices to achieve good performance. When we additionally combine our synthetic training samples with real data we even outperform existing state-of-the-art methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995574","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995574.pdf","startPage":"1473","endPage":"1480","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning people detection models from few training samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning people detection models from few training samples","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995574/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258074","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995574/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning people detection models from few training samples","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077455S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5995585,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Panagopoulos","affiliation":["Image Analysis Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Panagopoulos","id":"37556658400"},{"name":"Chaohui Wang","affiliation":["Laboratoire MAS, \u00c9cole Centrale Paris, Chatenay-Malabry, France"],"firstName":"Chaohui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405900000"},{"name":"Dimitris Samaras","affiliation":["Image Analysis Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Samaras","id":"37298492400"},{"name":"Nikos Paragios","affiliation":["Laboratoire MAS, \u00c9cole Centrale Paris, Chatenay-Malabry, France"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Paragios","id":"37282985600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995585","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":861},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995585","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Light sources","Geometry","Three dimensional displays","Estimation","Proposals","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference mechanisms","Markov processes","object detection","random processes","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illumination estimation","cast shadow detection","higher-order graphical model","illumination environment","cast shadow estimation","coarse 3D geometry","higher-order Markov random field illumination model","higher-order MRF illumination model","low-level shadow evidence","rough illumination estimation","voting procedure","inference method","coarse 3D model"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination estimation and cast shadow detection through a higher-order graphical model","startPage":"673","endPage":"680","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995585","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel framework to jointly recover the illumination environment and an estimate of the cast shadows in a scene from a single image, given coarse 3D geometry. We describe a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) illumination model, which combines low-level shadow evidence with high-level prior knowledge for the joint estimation of cast shadows and the illumination environment. First, a rough illumination estimate and the structure of the graphical model in the illumination space is determined through a voting procedure. Then, a higher order approach is considered where illumination sources are coupled with the observed image and the latent variables corresponding to the shadow detection. We examine two inference methods in order to effectively minimize the MRF energy of our model. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach is robust to rough knowledge of geometry and reflectance and inaccurate initial shadow estimates. We demonstrate the power of our MRF illumination model on various datasets and show that we can estimate the illumination in images of objects belonging to the same class using the same coarse 3D model to represent all instances of the class.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995585/","accessionNumber":"12258085","displayDocTitle":"Illumination estimation and cast shadow detection through a higher-order graphical model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination estimation and cast shadow detection through a higher-order graphical model","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054315S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5995586,"authors":[{"name":"Sangmin Oh","firstName":"Sangmin","lastName":"Oh","id":"37068116400"},{"name":"Anthony Hoogs","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Hoogs","id":"38334702100"},{"name":"Amitha Perera","firstName":"Amitha","lastName":"Perera","id":"37270738800"},{"name":"Naresh Cuntoor","firstName":"Naresh","lastName":"Cuntoor","id":"37274531200"},{"name":"Chia-Chih Chen","firstName":"Chia-Chih","lastName":"Chen","id":"37656952900"},{"name":"Jong Taek Lee","firstName":"Jong Taek","lastName":"Lee","id":"37835506900"},{"name":"Saurajit Mukherjee","firstName":"Saurajit","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"38367728500"},{"name":"J.

Previous datasets for action recognition are unrealistic for real-world surveillance because they consist of short clips showing one action by one individual [15, 8]. Datasets have been developed for movies [11] and sports [12], but, these actions and scene conditions do not apply effectively to surveillance videos. Our dataset consists of many outdoor scenes with actions occurring naturally by non-actors in continuously captured videos of the real world. The dataset includes large numbers of instances for 23 event types distributed throughout 29 hours of video. This data is accompanied by detailed annotations which include both moving object tracks and event examples, which will provide solid basis for large-scale evaluation. Additionally, we propose different types of evaluation modes for visual recognition tasks and evaluation metrics along with our preliminary experimental results. We believe that this dataset will stimulate diverse aspects of computer vision research and help us to advance the CVER tasks in the years ahead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A large-scale benchmark dataset for event recognition in surveillance video","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995586","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995586.pdf","startPage":"3153","endPage":"3160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A large-scale benchmark dataset for event recognition in surveillance video","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995586/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258086","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A large-scale benchmark dataset for event recognition in surveillance video","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135678S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"266","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":5995589,"authors":[{"name":"Stefanie Jegelka","affiliation":["Max Planck Institutes T\u00fcbingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefanie","lastName":"Jegelka","id":"37643688800"},{"name":"Jeff Bilmes","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Bilmes","id":"37271129500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995589","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":747},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Image segmentation","Approximation methods","Couplings","Labeling","Approximation algorithms","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","graph theory","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["submodular energies","graph cuts","nonsubmodular global energy functions","approximation algorithm","edge coupling","image segmentation","fine structured objects","shading variation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995589","abstract":"We propose a new family of non-submodular global energy functions that still use submodularity internally to couple edges in a graph cut.

In this paper, we propose a supervised segmentation approach that tightly integrates object-level top down information with low-level image cues. The information from the two levels is fused under a kernelized structural SVM learning framework. We defined a novel nonlinear kernel for comparing two image-segmentation masks. This kernel combines four different kernels: the object similarity kernel, the object shape kernel, the per-image color distribution kernel, and the global color distribution kernel. Our experiments show that the structured SVM algorithm finds bad segmentations of the training examples given the current scoring function and punishes these bad segmentations to lower scores than the example (good) segmentations. The result is a segmentation algorithm that not only knows what good segmentations are, but also learns potential segmentation mistakes and tries to avoid them. Our proposed approach can obtain comparable performance to other state-of-the-art top-down driven segmentation approaches yet is flexible enough to be applied to widely different domains.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","startPage":"2153","endPage":"2160","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995597.pdf","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995597","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Support vector machines","Image segmentation","Training","Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image matching","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernelized structural SVM learning","supervised object segmentation","low-level image cue","image segmentation mask","object similarity kernel","object shape kernel","per-image color distribution kernel","color distribution kernel","current scoring function","state-of-the-art top-down driven segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Kernelized structural SVM learning for supervised object segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258097","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995597/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995597/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernelized structural SVM learning for supervised object segmentation","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073081S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5995598,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Shi Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, UK","School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Shi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37399449200"},{"name":"Shaogang Gong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Shaogang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37269431700"},{"name":"Tao Xiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37398590900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995598","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":389,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided instruction","Cameras","Probabilistic logic","Training","Optimization","Learning systems","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image matching","learning (artificial intelligence)","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["person re-identification","probabilistic relative distance comparison","visual appearance change","visual feature extraction","distance learning method","people matching","intra-class variation","rank boosting","rank learning"]}],"abstract":"Matching people across non-overlapping camera views, known as person re-identification, is challenging due to the lack of spatial and temporal constraints and large visual appearance changes caused by variations in view angle, lighting, background clutter and occlusion. To address these challenges, most previous approaches aim to extract visual features that are both distinctive and stable under appearance changes. However, most visual features and their combinations under realistic conditions are neither stable nor distinctive thus should not be used indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose to formulate person re-identification as a distance learning problem, which aims to learn the optimal distance that can maximises matching accuracy regardless the choice of representation. To that end, we introduce a novel Probabilistic Relative Distance Comparison (PRDC) model, which differs from most existing distance learning methods in that, rather than minimising intra-class variation whilst maximising intra-class variation, it aims to maximise the probability of a pair of true match having a smaller distance than that of a wrong match pair. This makes our model more tolerant to appearance changes and less susceptible to model over-fitting. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that 1) by formulating the person re-identification problem as a distance learning problem, notable improvement on matching accuracy can be obtained against conventional person re-identification techniques, which is particularly significant when the training sample size is small; and 2) our PRDC outperforms not only existing distance learning methods but also alternative learning methods based on boosting and learning to rank.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Person re-identification by probabilistic relative distance comparison","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995598","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995598.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Person re-identification by probabilistic relative distance comparison","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995598/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258098","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Person re-identification by probabilistic relative distance comparison","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059582S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"389","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995601,"authors":[{"name":"Ond\u0159ej Chum","affiliation":["Centre of Machine Perception, Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ond\u0159ej","lastName":"Chum","id":"37271058200"},{"name":"Andrej Mikul\u00edk","affiliation":["Centre of Machine Perception, Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Andrej","lastName":"Mikul\u00edk","id":"37945357700"},{"name":"Michal Perdoch","affiliation":["Centre of Machine Perception, Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Perdoch","id":"37545632900"},{"name":"Ji\u0159\u00ed Matas","affiliation":["Centre of Machine Perception, Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ji\u0159\u00ed","lastName":"Matas","id":"37271060600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995601","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":179,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Visualization","Vocabulary","Optical wavelength conversion","Databases","Context modeling","Search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","image retrieval","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particular query object retrieval","image retrieval","bag-of-words model","state-of-the-art retrieval performance","automatic query expansion","tf-idf failure","correlated feature","spatial verification","statistical model","spatial context","standard Paris dataset","Oxford dataset","standard protocol"]}],"abstract":"Most effective particular object and image retrieval approaches are based on the bag-of-words (BoW) model.

In previous articulated pose estimation work on unconstrained videos, using temporal coupling of limb positions has made little to no difference in performance over parsing frames individually. One crucial reason for this is that joint parsing of multiple articulated parts over time involves intractable inference and learning problems, and previous work has resorted to approximate inference and simplified models. We overcome these computational and modeling limitations using an ensemble of tractable submodels which couple locations of body joints within and across frames using expressive cues. Each submodel is responsible for tracking a single joint through time (e.g., left elbow) and also models the spatial arrangement of all joints in a single frame. Because of the tree structure of each submodel, we can perform efficient exact inference and use rich temporal features that depend on image appearance, e.g., color tracking and optical flow contours. We propose and experimentally investigate a hierarchy of submodel combination methods, and we find that a highly efficient max-marginal combination method outperforms much slower (by orders of magnitude) approximate inference using dual decomposition. We apply our pose model on a new video dataset of highly varied and articulated poses from TV shows. We show significant quantitative and qualitative improvements over state-of-the-art single-frame pose estimation approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995607.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1288","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parsing human motion with stretchable models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Computational modeling","Videos","Image color analysis","Humans","Elbow","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image sequences","inference mechanisms","motion estimation","pose estimation","tree data structures","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stretchable model","human motion parsing","articulated human pose estimation problem","tractable model ensemble","motion cues","unconstrained videos","temporal coupling","joint multiple articulated parts parsing","intractable inference","learning problem","approximate inference","tree structure","temporal features","image appearance","color tracking","optical flow contours","max-marginal combination method","dual decomposition","video dataset","single-frame pose estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parsing human motion with stretchable models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995607/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258107","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parsing human motion with stretchable models","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087644S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995610,"authors":[{"name":"David M.

In existing systems, either the motion models are oversimplified, or important factors such as blur kernel and noise level are assumed to be known. Such models cannot deal with the scene and imaging conditions that vary from one sequence to another. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution via simultaneously estimating underlying motion, blur kernel and noise level while reconstructing the original high-res frames. As a result, our system not only produces very promising super resolution results that outperform the state of the art, but also adapts to a variety of noise levels and blur kernels. Theoretical analysis of the relationship between blur kernel, noise level and frequency-wise reconstruction rate is also provided, consistent with our experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995614","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995614.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995614","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995614/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995614/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258114","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072768S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5995621,"authors":[{"name":"Lu-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Research Center of Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lu-Hung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37964937600"},{"name":"Yao-Hsiang Yang","affiliation":["Research Center of Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Hsiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37965276700"},{"name":"Chu-Song Chen","affiliation":["Research Center of Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chu-Song","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280738300"},{"name":"Ming-Yen Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Yen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37955839100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995621","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":837},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Feature extraction","Face","Face recognition","Correlation","Databases","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","lighting","matrix algebra","statistical analysis","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illumination invariant feature extraction","natural image statistics","face images","scale invariant property","power spectra analysis","Wiener filter approach","linear time algorithm","linear equations","banded matrix","variable lighting face recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995621","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995621.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination invariant feature extraction based on natural images statistics \u2014 Taking face images as an example","abstract":"Natural images are known to carry several distinct properties which are not shared with randomly generated images. In this article we utilize the scale invariant property of natural images to construct a filter which extracts features invariant to illumination conditions. In contrast to most of the existing methods which assume that such features lie in high frequency part of spectrum, by analyzing the power spectra of natural images we show that some of these features could lie in low frequency part as well. From this fact, we derive a Wiener filter approach to best separate the illumination-invariant features from an image. We also provide a linear time algorithm for our proposed Wiener filter, which only involves solving linear equations with narrowly banded matrix. Our experiments on variable lighting face recognition show that our proposed method does achieve the best recognition rate and is generally faster compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995621/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258121","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Illumination invariant feature extraction based on natural images statistics \u2014 Taking face images as an example","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination invariant feature extraction based on natural images statistics \u2014 Taking face images as an example","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065544S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995623,"authors":[{"name":"Tianshi Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Tianshi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37409145100"},{"name":"Benjamin Packer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Packer","id":"37945408100"},{"name":"Daphne Koller","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Daphne","lastName":"Koller","id":"37278029500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995623","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1098},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995623","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Image segmentation","Equations","Detectors","Joints","Inference algorithms","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","image representation","image segmentation","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segmentation-aware object detection model","object-object occlusion handling","bounding box representation","binary variables","structured output framework","segmentation reasoning","cell level segmentation","Street Scenes datasets","Pascal VOC 2007 dataset","image understanding"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A segmentation-aware object detection model with occlusion handling","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1368","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995623","abstract":"The bounding box representation employed by many popular object detection models [3, 6] implicitly assumes all pixels inside the box belong to the object.

In this paper, we augment the bounding box with a set of binary variables each of which corresponds to a cell indicating whether the pixels in the cell belong to the object. This segmentation-aware representation explicitly models and accounts for the supporting pixels for the object within the bounding box thus more robust to occlusion. We learn the model in a structured output framework, and develop a method that efficiently performs both inference and learning using this rich representation. The method is able to use segmentation reasoning to achieve improved detection results with richer output (cell level segmentation) on the Street Scenes and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets. Finally, we present a globally coherent object model using our rich representation to account for object-object occlusion resulting in a more coherent image understanding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995623/","accessionNumber":"12258123","displayDocTitle":"A segmentation-aware object detection model with occlusion handling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A segmentation-aware object detection model with occlusion handling","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05378S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5995624,"authors":[{"name":"Xinxiao Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xinxiao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407330900"},{"name":"Dong Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37291414100"},{"name":"Lixin Duan","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Duan","id":"37404722400"},{"name":"Jiebo Luo","affiliation":["Kodak Research Laboratories, Eastman Kodak (Japan) Limited, Rochester, USA"],"firstName":"Jiebo","lastName":"Luo","id":"37278982400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995624","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":144,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1774},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Kernel","Feature extraction","Context modeling","Humans","Training","Legged locomotion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image classification","image recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","spatiotemporal phenomena","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["appearance distribution features","spatiotemporal context distribution feature","human action recognition","action video representation","pairwise interest points","global GMM","video-specific GMM","multiscale local region","appearance information","multiple GMM distribution","local video appearance","heterogeneous distribution features","complementary distribution features","learning algorithm","multiple kernel learning with augmented features","AFMKL","adapted classifier","pre-learned classifier","Gaussian mixture model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995624","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995624.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Action recognition using context and appearance distribution features","abstract":"We first propose a new spatio-temporal context distribution feature of interest points for human action recognition. Each action video is expressed as a set of relative XYT coordinates between pairwise interest points in a local region. We learn a global GMM (referred to as Universal Background Model, UBM) using the relative coordinate features from all the training videos, and then represent each video as the normalized parameters of a video-specific GMM adapted from the global GMM. In order to capture the spatio-temporal relationships at different levels, multiple GMMs are utilized to describe the context distributions of interest points over multi-scale local regions. To describe the appearance information of an action video, we also propose to use GMM to characterize the distribution of local appearance features from the cuboids centered around the interest points. Accordingly, an action video can be represented by two types of distribution features: 1) multiple GMM distributions of spatio-temporal context; 2) GMM distribution of local video appearance. To effectively fuse these two types of heterogeneous and complementary distribution features, we additionally propose a new learning algorithm, called Multiple Kernel Learning with Augmented Features (AFMKL), to learn an adapted classifier based on multiple kernels and the pre-learned classifiers of other action classes. Extensive experiments on KTH, multi-view IXMAS and complex UCF sports datasets demonstrate that our method generally achieves higher recognition accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995624/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258124","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Action recognition using context and appearance distribution features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action recognition using context and appearance distribution features","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09642S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5995627,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Rohrbach","affiliation":["MPI Informatics, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Rohrbach","id":"37547737000"},{"name":"Michael Stark","affiliation":["MPI Informatics, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Stark","id":"37410111200"},{"name":"Bernt Schiele","affiliation":["MPI Informatics, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Schiele","id":"37265607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995627","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":138,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1289},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995627","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge transfer","Training","Semantics","Error analysis","Visualization","Training data","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge transfer","zero-shot learning","object class","scalable recognition","ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition","image classification"]}],"abstract":"While knowledge transfer (KT) between object classes has been accepted as a promising route towards scalable recognition, most experimental KT studies are surprisingly limited in the number of object classes considered. To support claims of KT w.r.t. scalability we thus advocate to evaluate KT in a large-scale setting. To this end, we provide an extensive evaluation of three popular approaches to KT on a recently proposed large-scale data set, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition 2010 data set. In a first setting they are directly compared to one-vs-all classification often neglected in KT papers and in a second setting we evaluate their ability to enable zero-shot learning. While none of the KT methods can improve over one-vs-all classification they prove valuable for zero-shot learning, especially hierarchical and direct similarity based KT. We also propose and describe several extensions of the evaluated approaches that are necessary for this large-scale study.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995627","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995627","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995627.pdf","startPage":"1641","endPage":"1648","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating knowledge transfer and zero-shot learning in a large-scale setting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluating knowledge transfer and zero-shot learning in a large-scale setting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12258127","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995627/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating knowledge transfer and zero-shot learning in a large-scale setting","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080239S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995631,"authors":[{"name":"Subhransu Maji","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Subhransu","lastName":"Maji","id":"37397782700"},{"name":"Lubomir Bourdev","affiliation":["Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA","University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Lubomir","lastName":"Bourdev","id":"37397563700"},{"name":"Jitendra Malik","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Malik","id":"37282929000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995631","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":184,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1046},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Head","Torso","Three dimensional displays","Humans","Estimation","Detectors","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action recognition","pose representation","appearance representation","poselet activation vector","pose estimation","3D head orientation","3D torso orientation","PASCAL VOC 2010 static image","image action classification"]}],"abstract":"We present a distributed representation of pose and appearance of people called the \u201cposelet activation vector\u201d.

We extensively test our algorithms using a new dataset of several hundred RGB-NIR scene images, as well as benchmarking against Torralba's scene categorization dataset.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995637","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995637.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","startPage":"177","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-spectral SIFT for scene category recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-spectral SIFT for scene category recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995637/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218780","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995637/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-spectral SIFT for scene category recognition","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079526S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995646,"authors":[{"name":"Adrien Gaidon","affiliation":["LEAR, LJK, INRIA Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Gaidon","id":"37945420900"},{"name":"Zaid Harchaoui","affiliation":["LEAR, LJK, INRIA Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Zaid","lastName":"Harchaoui","id":"37643824200"},{"name":"Cordelia Schmid","affiliation":["LEAR, LJK, INRIA Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Cordelia","lastName":"Schmid","id":"37282990700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995646","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":637},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Visualization","Adaptation models","Histograms","Kernel","Motion pictures","Manuals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action detection","actom sequence models","actom-anchored visual features","parametric model"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of detecting actions, such as drinking or opening a door, in hours of challenging video data.

Comparing with previous methods, ours have three main advantages. First, our method does not rely on any assumption on video preprocessing quality, such as satisfactory foreground segmentation or reliable tracking; Second, we propose a novel compact representation for human pose which works together with human detection and can well represent the spatial and temporal structures inside an action; Third, with human detection taken into consideration in our framework, our method has the ability to locate and recognize multiple actions in the same scene.

As a consequence of MAP estimation, separate pre-processing steps such as noise estimation and training of the regularization parameter are necessary to avoid user interaction. Moreover, MAP estimates involving standard natural image priors have been found lacking in terms of restoration performance. To address these issues we introduce an integrated Bayesian framework that unifies non-blind deblurring and noise estimation, thus freeing the user of tediously pre-determining a noise level. A sampling-based technique allows to integrate out the unknown noise level and to perform deblurring using the Bayesian minimum mean squared error estimate (MMSE), which requires no regularization parameter and yields higher performance than MAP estimates when combined with a learned high-order image prior. A quantitative evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art results for both non-blind deblurring and noise estimation.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995653","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995653.pdf","startPage":"2625","endPage":"2632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian deblurring with integrated noise estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995653/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian deblurring with integrated noise estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218796","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995653/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian deblurring with integrated noise estimation","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077499S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995659,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Brox","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Brox","id":"37541664500"},{"name":"Lubomir Bourdev","affiliation":["Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA","University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Lubomir","lastName":"Bourdev","id":"37397563700"},{"name":"Subhransu Maji","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Subhransu","lastName":"Maji","id":"37397782700"},{"name":"Jitendra Malik","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Malik","id":"37282929000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995659","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":742},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose techniques to make use of two complementary bottom-up features, image edges and texture patches, to guide top-down object segmentation towards higher precision.

We non-rigidly align these part detections to potential object contours in the image, both to increase the precision of the predicted object mask and to sort out false positives. We spatially aggregate object information via a variational smoothing technique while ensuring that object regions do not overlap. Finally, we propose to refine the segmentation based on self-similarity defined on small image patches. We obtain competitive results on the challenging Pascal VOC benchmark.

However, most of the existing classification methods do not explicitly take this structure into account. In this paper, we consider the problem of classification in the multi-sub space setting using sparse representation techniques. We exploit the fact that the dictionary of all the training data has a block structure where the training data in each class form few blocks of the dictionary. We cast the classification as a structured sparse recovery problem where our goal is to find a representation of a test example that uses the minimum number of blocks from the dictionary. We formulate this problem using two different classes of non-convex optimization programs. We propose convex relaxations for these two non-convex programs and study conditions under which the relaxations are equivalent to the original problems. In addition, we show that the proposed optimization programs can be modified properly to also deal with corrupted data. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, we consider the problem of automatic face recognition. We show that casting the face recognition problem as a structured sparse recovery problem can improve the results of the state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms, especially when we have relatively small number of training data for each class. In particular, we show that the new class of convex programs can improve the state-of-the-art face recognition results by 10% with only 25% of the training data. In addition, we show that the algorithms are robust to occlusion, corruption, and disguise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218807","htmlLink":"/document/5995664/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust classification using structured sparse representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust classification using structured sparse representation","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080602S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5995665,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Lee","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Lee","id":"38258913200"},{"name":"Ying Wu","affiliation":["Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wu","id":"37089069448"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995665","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":41,"totalDownloads":591},"abstract":"This work attempts to considerably reduce the amount of user effort in the natural image matting problem. The key observation is that the nonlocal principle, introduced to denoise images, can be successfully applied to the alpha matte to obtain sparsity in matte representation, and therefore dramatically reduce the number of pixels a user needs to manually label. We show how to avoid making the user provide redundant and unnecessary input, develop a method for clustering the image pixels for the user to label, and a method to perform high-quality matte extraction. We show that this algorithm is therefore faster, easier, and higher quality than state of the art methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Kernel","Accuracy","Clustering algorithms","Cameras","Image color analysis","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image denoising","image representation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlocal matting","natural image matting problem","nonlocal principle","image denoising","matte representation","pixel reduction","image pixel clustering","high-quality matte extraction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995665","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995665.pdf","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlocal matting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlocal matting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995665/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995665/","accessionNumber":"12218808","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlocal matting","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07504S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5995667,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Benfold","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Benfold","id":"38235179100"},{"name":"Ian Reid","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Reid","id":"37282640200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995667","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":326,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":4879},"abstract":"The majority of existing pedestrian trackers concentrate on maintaining the identities of targets, however systems for remote biometric analysis or activity recognition in surveillance video often require stable bounding-boxes around pedestrians rather than approximate locations. We present a multi-target tracking system that is designed specifically for the provision of stable and accurate head location estimates. By performing data association over a sliding window of frames, we are able to correct many data association errors and fill in gaps where observations are missed. The approach is multi-threaded and combines asynchronous HOG detections with simultaneous KLT tracking and Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Data Association (MCM-CDA) to provide guaranteed real-time tracking in high definition video. Where previous approaches have used ad-hoc models for data association, we use a more principled approach based on a Minimal Description Length (MDL) objective which accurately models the affinity between observations. We demonstrate by qualitative and quantitative evaluation that the system is capable of providing precise location estimates for large crowds of pedestrians in real-time. To facilitate future performance comparisons, we make a new dataset with hand annotated ground truth head locations publicly available.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995667.pdf","startPage":"3457","endPage":"3464","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable multi-target tracking in real-time surveillance video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Head","Real time systems","Proposals","Streaming media","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","object detection","real-time systems","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitarget tracking","real-time surveillance video","pedestrian trackers","remote biometric analysis","activity recognition","approximate locations","sliding window","data association","HOG detections","MCM-CDA","Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Data Association","minimal description length","MDL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Stable multi-target tracking in real-time surveillance video","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995667/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218810","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable multi-target tracking in real-time surveillance video","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04834S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"326","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5995676,"authors":[{"name":"Lijuan Duan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lijuan","lastName":"Duan","id":"37675262200"},{"name":"Chunpeng Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunpeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37673010100"},{"name":"Jun Miao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Miao","id":"37682064200"},{"name":"Laiyun Qing","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Laiyun","lastName":"Qing","id":"37269448400"},{"name":"Yu Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Fu","id":"37686643700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995676","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":176,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1805},"abstract":"In this paper, a new visual saliency detection method is proposed based on the spatially weighted dissimilarity.

The dissimilarities were inversely weighted based on the corresponding spatial distance. A weighting mechanism, indicating a bias for human fixations to the center of the image, was employed. The principal component analysis (PCA) was the dimension reducing method used in our system. We extracted the principal components (PCs) by sampling the patches from the current image. Our method was compared with four saliency detection approaches using three image datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on predicting human fixations.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995676.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"480","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual saliency detection by spatially weighted dissimilarity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Color","Visualization","Image color analysis","Principal component analysis","Correlation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual saliency detection method","spatially weighted dissimilarity","image patches","weighting mechanism","principal component analysis","PCA","dimension reducing method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Visual saliency detection by spatially weighted dissimilarity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218819","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual saliency detection by spatially weighted dissimilarity","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075493S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995678,"authors":[{"name":"Junge Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Junge","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37337402200"},{"name":"Kaiqi Huang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Kaiqi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37402212100"},{"name":"Yinan Yu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yinan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37963801400"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Tieniu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274122900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995678","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Histograms","Detectors","Training","Computational modeling","Robustness","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image texture","lighting","object detection","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local structured HOG-LBP","object localization","low-level feature representation","bottom-up paradigm","object detector","local structured descriptor","texture information","shape information","boosted feature selection","PASCAL VOC2007 dataset"]}],"abstract":"Object localization is a challenging problem due to variations in object's structure and illumination. Although existing part based models have achieved impressive progress in the past several years, their improvement is still limited by low-level feature representation. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the description of object structure from both feature level and topology level. Following the bottom-up paradigm, we propose a boosted Local Structured HOG-LBP based object detector. Firstly, at feature level, we propose Local Structured Descriptor to capture the object's local structure, and develop the descriptors from shape and texture information, respectively. Secondly, at topology level, we present a boosted feature selection and fusion scheme for part based object detector. All experiments are conducted on the challenging PASCAL VOC2007 datasets.

Surfaces which do not have direct support in the input 3D point cloud and hence need not be photo-consistent but represent real parts of the scene (e.g. low-textured walls, windows, cars) are important for achieving complete reconstructions. We augmented the existing Labatut CGF 2009 method with the ability to cope with these difficult surfaces just by changing the t-edge weights in the construction of surfaces by a minimal s-t cut. Our method uses Visual-Hull to reconstruct the difficult surfaces which are not sampled densely enough by the input 3D point cloud. We demonstrate importance of these surfaces on several real-world data sets. We compare our improvement to our implementation of the Labatut CGF 2009 method and show that our method can considerably better reconstruct difficult surfaces while preserving thin structures and details in the same quality and computational time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995693/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995693/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218835","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-view reconstruction preserving weakly-supported surfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-view reconstruction preserving weakly-supported surfaces","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059902S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5995698,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406961700"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995698","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":868},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Vehicles","Training","Reliability","Labeling","Lighting","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","pattern clustering","traffic","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic adaptation","generic pedestrian detector","labeled large scale training sets","scene structures","appearance-based detector","multiple hierarchical clustering steps","background subtraction","video sequences"]}],"abstract":"In recent years significant progress has been made learning generic pedestrian detectors from manually labeled large scale training sets. However, when a generic pedestrian detector is applied to a specific scene where the testing data does not match with the training data because of variations of viewpoints, resolutions, illuminations and backgrounds, its accuracy may decrease greatly. In this paper, we propose a new framework of adapting a pre-trained generic pedestrian detector to a specific traffic scene by automatically selecting both confident positive and negative examples from the target scene to re-train the detector iteratively. An important feature of the proposed framework is to utilize unsupervisedly learned models of vehicle and pedestrian paths, together with multiple other cues such as locations, sizes, appearance and motions to select new training samples. The information of scene structures increases the reliability of selected samples and is complementary to the appearance-based detector. However, it was not well explored in previous studies. In order to further improve the reliability of selected samples, outliers are removed through multiple hierarchical clustering steps. The effectiveness of different cues and clustering steps is evaluated through experiments. The proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of the generic pedestrian detector and also outperforms the scene specific detector retrained using background subtraction. Its results are comparable with the detector trained using a large number of manually labeled frames from the target scene.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic adaptation of a generic pedestrian detector to a specific traffic scene","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995698","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995698.pdf","startPage":"3401","endPage":"3408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Automatic adaptation of a generic pedestrian detector to a specific traffic scene","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995698/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218840","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic adaptation of a generic pedestrian detector to a specific traffic scene","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076249S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5995700,"authors":[{"name":"David L.

Most methods integrate a priori appearance information and some sort of hard or soft constraint on the allowable strings. Weinman and Learned-Miller [14] showed that the similarity among characters, as a supplement to the appearance of the characters with respect to a model, could be used to improve scene text recognition. In this work, we make further improvements to scene text recognition by taking a novel approach to the incorporation of similarity. In particular, we train a similarity expert that learns to classify each pair of characters as equivalent or not. After removing logical inconsistencies in an equivalence graph, we formulate the search for the maximum likelihood interpretation of a sign as an integer program. We incorporate the equivalence information as constraints in the integer program and build an optimization criterion out of appearance features and character bigrams. Finally, we take the optimal solution from the integer program, and compare all \u201cnearby\u201d solutions using a probability model for strings derived from search engine queries. We demonstrate word error reductions of more than 30% relative to previous methods on the same data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995700/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12218842","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995700/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enforcing similarity constraints with integer programming for better scene text recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enforcing similarity constraints with integer programming for better scene text recognition","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059032S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5995701,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Kulkarni","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"37949672500"},{"name":"Baoxin Li","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Baoxin","lastName":"Li","id":"37292487900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995701","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":958},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995701","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Encoding","Cameras","Training","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine transforms","cameras","feature extraction","image classification","image coding","image representation","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative affine sparse code","image classification","camera parameters","representational space","performance degradation","camera orientation","pose orientation","feature extraction","affine-invariant features","affine-transformed input images","AdaBoost classifier"]}],"abstract":"Images in general are captured under a diverse set of conditions. An image of the same object can be captured with varied poses, illuminations, scales, backgrounds and probably different camera parameters. The task of image classification then lies in forming features of the input images in a representational space where classifiers can be better supported in spite of the above variations. Existing methods have mostly focused on obtaining features which are invariant to scale and translation, and thus they generally suffer from performance degradation on datasets which consist of images with varied poses or camera orientations. In this paper we present a new framework for image classification, which is built upon a novel way of feature extraction that generates largely affine-invariant features called affine sparse codes. This is achieved through learning a compact dictionary of features from affine-transformed input images. Analysis and experiments indicate that this novel feature is highly discriminative in addition to being largely affine-invariant. A classifier using AdaBoost is then designed using the affine sparse codes as the input. Extensive experiments with standard databases demonstrate that the proposed approach can obtain the state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing leading approaches in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995701","endPage":"1616","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995701.pdf","startPage":"1609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative affine sparse codes for image classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995701/","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative affine sparse codes for image classification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218843","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995701/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative affine sparse codes for image classification","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052285S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5995702,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Kulis","affiliation":["EECS and ICSI, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Kulis","id":"37397827700"},{"name":"Kate Saenko","affiliation":["EECS and ICSI, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Kate","lastName":"Saenko","id":"37298968800"},{"name":"Trevor Darrell","affiliation":["EECS and ICSI, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Darrell","id":"37282910600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995702","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":329,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Adaptation models","Training","Visualization","Measurement","Support vector machines","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric kernel transform","real-world application","visual domain adaptation","object model transfer","supervised learning","nonlinear transformation","kernel space","symmetric transformation","object recognition model","imaging condition"]}],"abstract":"In real-world applications, \u201cwhat you saw\u201d during training is often not \u201cwhat you get\u201d during deployment: the distribution and even the type and dimensionality of features can change from one dataset to the next.

Our method is based on a novel theoretical result demonstrating that such transformations can be learned in kernel space. Unlike existing work, our model is not restricted to symmetric transformations, nor to features of the same type and dimensionality, making it applicable to a significantly wider set of adaptation scenarios than previous methods. Furthermore, the method can be applied to categories that were not available during training.

Such approaches are not an alternative to using index structures but a complementary way to reduce both the memory usage and the distance computation cost. Several data dependent hash functions have notably been proposed to closely fit data distribution and provide better selectivity than usual random projections such as LSH. However, improvements occur only for relatively small hash code sizes up to 64 or 128 bits. As discussed in the paper, this is mainly due to the lack of independence between the produced hash functions. We introduce a new hash function family that attempts to solve this issue in any kernel space. Rather than boosting the collision probability of close points, our method focus on data scattering. By training purely random splits of the data, regardless the closeness of the training samples, it is indeed possible to generate consistently more independent hash functions. On the other side, the use of large margin classifiers allows to maintain good generalization performances. Experiments show that our new Random Maximum Margin Hashing scheme (RMMH) outperforms four state-of-the-art hashing methods, notably in kernel spaces.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995709","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995709.pdf","startPage":"873","endPage":"880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random maximum margin hashing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995709/","displayDocTitle":"Random maximum margin hashing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218851","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995709/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random maximum margin hashing","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087147S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5995710,"authors":[{"name":"Marc'Aurelio Ranzato","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Marc'Aurelio","lastName":"Ranzato","id":"37891706700"},{"name":"Joshua Susskind","affiliation":["Institute for Neural Computation, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Susskind","id":"37937119800"},{"name":"Volodymyr Mnih","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Mnih","id":"37945396200"},{"name":"Geoffrey Hinton","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Hinton","id":"37270925500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995710","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":90,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1370},"abstract":"The most popular way to use probabilistic models in vision is first to extract some descriptors of small image patches or object parts using well-engineered features, and then to use statistical learning tools to model the dependencies among these features and eventual labels. Learning probabilistic models directly on the raw pixel values has proved to be much more difficult and is typically only used for regularizing discriminative methods. In this work, we use one of the best, pixel-level, generative models of natural images-a gated MRF-as the lowest level of a deep belief network (DBN) that has several hidden layers. We show that the resulting DBN is very good at coping with occlusion when predicting expression categories from face images, and it can produce features that perform comparably to SIFT descriptors for discriminating different types of scene. The generative ability of the model also makes it easy to see what information is captured and what is lost at each level of representation.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995710.pdf","startPage":"2857","endPage":"2864","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On deep generative models with applications to recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Training","Tiles","Logic gates","Adaptation models","Feature extraction","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","feature extraction","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep generative model","image patch","statistical learning tool","learning probabilistic model","natural image","gated MRF","deep belief network","face image","SIFT descriptor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"On deep generative models with applications to recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995710/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218852","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On deep generative models with applications to recognition","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082831S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995711,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Amin Sadeghi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad Amin","lastName":"Sadeghi","id":"37953377900"},{"name":"Ali Farhadi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Farhadi","id":"37410280900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995711","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":212,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2416},"abstract":"In this paper we introduce visual phrases, complex visual composites like \u201ca person riding a horse\u201d. Visual phrases often display significantly reduced visual complexity compared to their component objects, because the appearance of those objects can change profoundly when they participate in relations. We introduce a dataset suitable for phrasal recognition that uses familiar PASCAL object categories, and demonstrate significant experimental gains resulting from exploiting visual phrases. We show that a visual phrase detector significantly outperforms a baseline which detects component objects and reasons about relations, even though visual phrase training sets tend to be smaller than those for objects. We argue that any multi-class detection system must decode detector outputs to produce final results; this is usually done with non-maximum suppression. We describe a novel decoding procedure that can account accurately for local context without solving difficult inference problems. We show this decoding procedure outperforms the state of the art. Finally, we show that decoding a combination of phrasal and object detectors produces real improvements in detector results.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995711.pdf","startPage":"1745","endPage":"1752","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition using visual phrases","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Detectors","Decoding","Bicycles","Object recognition","Training","Deformable models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","image classification","object detection","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual phrase recognition","complex visual composites","visual complexity reduction","PASCAL object categories","visual phrase detector","component object detection","visual phrase training sets","multiclass detection system","nonmaximum suppression","decoding procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Recognition using visual phrases","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995711/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218853","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition using visual phrases","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075457S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995713,"authors":[{"name":"He He","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"He","id":"37962659600"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wan-Chi","lastName":"Siu","id":"37270783500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995713","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":146,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3220},"abstract":"In this paper we address the problem of producing a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution image without any external training set.

In our method, each pixel is predicted by its neighbors through the Gaussian process regression. We show that when using a proper covariance function, the Gaussian process regression can perform soft clustering of pixels based on their local structures. We further demonstrate that our algorithm can extract adequate information contained in a single low-resolution image to generate a high-resolution image with sharp edges, which is comparable to or even superior in quality to the performance of other edge-directed and example-based super-resolution algorithms. Experimental results also show that our approach maintains high-quality performance at large magnifications.","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995713.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"456","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single image super-resolution using Gaussian process regression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Ground penetrating radar","Mathematical model","Strontium","Image resolution","Equations","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","image resolution","image restoration","pattern clustering","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single image super resolution","Gaussian process regression","original low-resolution image","image deblurring","covariance function","soft clustering","example-based super-resolution algorithms","edge-directed super-resolution algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Single image super-resolution using Gaussian process regression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995713/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218855","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single image super-resolution using Gaussian process regression","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075471S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":5995717,"authors":[{"name":"Seungil Huh","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Seungil","lastName":"Huh","id":"37587796400"},{"name":"Mei Chen","affiliation":["Intel Science & Technology Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37075192000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995717","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":324},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995717","abstract":"Computer vision analysis of cells in phase-contrast microscopy images enables long-term continuous monitoring of live cells, which has not been feasible using the existing cellular staining methods due to the use of fluorescence reagents or fixatives. In cell culture analysis, accurate detection of mitosis, or cell division, is critical for quantitative study of cell proliferation. In this work, we present an approach that can detect mitosis within a cell population of high cell confluence, or high cell density, which has proven challenging because of the difficulty in separating individual cells. We first detect the candidates for birth events that are defined as the time and location at which mitosis is complete and two daughter cells first appear. Each candidate is then examined whether it is real or not after incorporating spatio-temporal information by tracking the candidate in the neighboring frames. For the examination, we design a probabilistic model named Two-Labeled Hidden Conditional Random Field (TL-HCRF) that can use the information on the timing of the candidate birth event in addition to the visual change of cells over time. Applied to two cell populations of high cell confluence, our method considerably outperforms previous methods. Comparisons with related statistical models also show the superiority of TL-HCRF on the proposed task.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995717","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1040","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995717.pdf","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of mitosis within a stem cell population of high cell confluence in phase-contrast microscopy images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Visualization","Training","Event detection","Microscopy","Support vector machines","Tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","botany","cellular biophysics","computer vision","computerised monitoring","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mitosis detection","stem cell population","high cell confluence","phase contrast microscopy image","computer vision analysis","long-term continuous monitoring","live cell division","fluorescence reagent","culture analysis","cell proliferation","daughter cells","spatio-temporal information","neighboring frame","probabilistic model","two-labeled hidden conditional random field","candidate birth event","statistical model","TL-HCRF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Detection of mitosis within a stem cell population of high cell confluence in phase-contrast microscopy images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995717/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218859","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of mitosis within a stem cell population of high cell confluence in phase-contrast microscopy images","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057846S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5995720,"authors":[{"name":"Ruslan Salakhutdinov","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ruslan","lastName":"Salakhutdinov","id":"37427069100"},{"name":"Antonio Torralba","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Torralba","id":"38183107900"},{"name":"Josh Tenenbaum","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Tenenbaum","id":"37622583000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995720","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":151,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1033},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to share visual appearance for multiclass object detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Training data","Object recognition","Databases","Object detection","Rocks","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical classification model","object detection","object recognition","object localization","share visual appearance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995720","abstract":"We present a hierarchical classification model that allows rare objects to borrow statistical strength from related objects that have many training examples.

Despite of this overflow of visual information, humans are extremely good at remembering thousands of pictures along with some of their visual details. But not all images are equal in memory. Some stitch to our minds, and other are forgotten. In this paper we focus on the problem of predicting how memorable an image will be. We show that memorability is a stable property of an image that is shared across different viewers. We introduce a database for which we have measured the probability that each picture will be remembered after a single view. We analyze image features and labels that contribute to making an image memorable, and we train a predictor based on global image descriptors. We find that predicting image memorability is a task that can be addressed with current computer vision techniques. Whereas making memorable images is a challenging task in visualization and photography, this work is a first attempt to quantify this useful quality of images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995721/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12218863","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995721/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"What makes an image memorable?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What makes an image memorable?","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051162S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5995724,"authors":[{"name":"St\u00e9phane Ross","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Ross","id":"37679349200"},{"name":"Daniel Munoz","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Munoz","id":"37584693300"},{"name":"Martial Hebert","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Martial","lastName":"Hebert","id":"37271437400"},{"name":"J.

While graphical models provide a clean separation between modeling and inference, learning these models with approximate inference is not well understood. Furthermore, even if a good model is learned, predictions are often inaccurate due to approximations. In this work, instead of performing inference over a graphical model, we instead consider the inference procedure as a composition of predictors. Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s. The result no longer corresponds to a graphical model but simply defines an inference procedure, with strong theoretical properties, that can be used to classify new graphs. We demonstrate the scalability and efficacy of our approach on 3D point cloud classification and 3D surface estimation from single images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995724","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995724.pdf","startPage":"2737","endPage":"2744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning message-passing inference machines for structured prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995724/","displayDocTitle":"Learning message-passing inference machines for structured prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218866","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995724/","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning message-passing inference machines for structured prediction","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062655S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995730,"authors":[{"name":"Baiyang Liu","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Baiyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37963124400"},{"name":"Junzhou Huang","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Junzhou","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293532300"},{"name":"Lin Yang","affiliation":["Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37384098500"},{"name":"Casimir Kulikowsk","affiliation":["State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Casimir","lastName":"Kulikowsk","id":"37944927900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995730","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":350,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1663},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Target tracking","Image reconstruction","Histograms","Encoding","Heuristic algorithms","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object tracking","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online learned tracking","local sparse appearance model","K-selection","potential drifting problems","SPT","online updated basis distribution model","sparse representation-based voting map","dictionary learning algorithm","robust object tracking algorithm","sparse constraint regularized mean-shift"]}],"abstract":"Online learned tracking is widely used for it's adaptive ability to handle appearance changes. However, it introduces potential drifting problems due to the accumulation of errors during the self-updating, especially for occluded scenarios. The recent literature demonstrates that appropriate combinations of trackers can help balance stability and flexibility requirements. We have developed a robust tracking algorithm using a local sparse appearance model (SPT). A static sparse dictionary and a dynamically online updated basis distribution model the target appearance. A novel sparse representation-based voting map and sparse constraint regularized mean-shift support the robust object tracking. Besides these contributions, we also introduce a new dictionary learning algorithm with a locally constrained sparse representation, called K-Selection.

A major factor causing tracking failure is the emergence of regions having similar appearance as the target. It is even more challenging when the target leaves the field of view (FoV) leading the tracker to follow another similar object, and not reacquire the right target when it reappears. This paper presents a method to address this problem by exploiting the context on-the-fly in two terms: Distracters and Supporters. Both of them are automatically explored using a sequential randomized forest, an online template-based appearance model, and local features. Distracters are regions which have similar appearance as the target and consistently co-occur with high confidence score. The tracker must keep tracking these distracters to avoid drifting. Supporters, on the other hand, are local key-points around the target with consistent co-occurrence and motion correlation in a short time span. They play an important role in verifying the genuine target. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world video sequences show the tracking improvement when using this context information. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art approaches are also provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218875","htmlLink":"/document/5995733/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Context tracker: Exploring supporters and distracters in unconstrained environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context tracker: Exploring supporters and distracters in unconstrained environments","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094329S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"340","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5995737,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Del Pero","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Del Pero","id":"37075867600"},{"name":"Jinyan Guan","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jinyan","lastName":"Guan","id":"37955292800"},{"name":"Ernesto Brau","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Brau","id":"37948874800"},{"name":"Joseph Schlecht","affiliation":["University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Schlecht","id":"37298412400"},{"name":"Kobus Barnard","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Kobus","lastName":"Barnard","id":"37282175300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995737","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":317},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling bedrooms","abstract":"We propose a top down approach for understanding indoor scenes such as bedrooms and living rooms. These environments typically have the Manhattan world property that many surfaces are parallel to three principle ones. Further, the 3D geometry of the room and objects within it can largely be approximated by non overlapping simple structures such as single blocks (e.g. the room boundary), thin blocks (e.g. picture frames), and objects that are well modeled by single blocks (e.g. simple beds). We separately model the 3D geometry, the imaging process (camera parameters), and edge likelihood, to provide a generative statistical model for image data. We fit this model using data driven MCMC sampling. We combine reversible jump Metropolis Hastings samples for discrete changes in the model such as the number of blocks, and stochastic dynamics to estimate continuous parameter values in a particular parameter space that includes block positions, block sizes, and camera parameters. We tested our approach on two datasets using room box pixel orientation. Despite using only bounding box geometry and, in particular, not training on appearance, our method achieves results approaching those of others. We also introduce a new evaluation method for this domain based on ground truth camera parameters, which we found to be more sensitive to the task of understanding scene geometry.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995737","publicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","startPage":"2009","endPage":"2016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995307","pdfPath":"/iel5/5968010/5995307/05995737.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"CVPR 2011","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Image edge detection","Three dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Computational modeling","Proposals","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computational geometry","edge detection","image sampling","parameter estimation","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling bedrooms","Manhattan world property","3D geometry","3D model","imaging process","edge likelihood","MCMC sampling","reversible jump Metropolis Hastings samples","stochastic dynamics","continuous parameter estimation","camera parameters","room box pixel orientation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling bedrooms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995737/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995737/","accessionNumber":"12218879","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling bedrooms","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"1958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06998S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5968010","isNumber":"5995307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5968010","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5995307","articleId":"5995737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5995741,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37539125200"},{"name":"Deva Ramanan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Deva","lastName":"Ramanan","id":"37393712400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0393-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6919"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"5995741","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":605,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":4060},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Springs","Computational modeling","Humans","Training","Deformable models","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","image coding","image representation","pose estimation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible mixture of parts","human pose estimation","static images","articulated limb parts","flexible mixture model","contextual co-occurrence relation","standard spring models","spatial relations","tree structure","dynamic programming"]}],"abstract":"We describe a method for human pose estimation in static images based on a novel representation of part models.

In the case of local context, we partition the image into patches and estimate saliency in each patch relative to a large dictionary of un-annotated patches from the rest of the image. We propose a unified framework that applies to both cases in three steps. First, given an input (image or patch) we extract k nearest neighbors from the dictionary.

It will also address the on-going problem of the lack of resources for Arabic research or semantic web technologies that support the Arabic text. While there may have already been various researches in the past that have been conducted in order to develop ontology-based and optimized semantic framework with the English content, there were very few researches that were developed for the Arabic language. This paper, reports on the survey of the support for the Arabic language in some of the existing semantic web technologies and gives future scenario in applying Semantic Web for Arabic applications. Finally, we propose a new framework intended to add a semantic web layer to the current web based application in order to improve the process of linking, integrating, and searching for different types of applications. The proposed framework will serve Arabic language processing, although it is designed to be adapted to any other languages.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Semantic Technology and Information Retrieval","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976947/5995747/05995757.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Semantic Technology and Information Retrieval","doi":"10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995747","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Arabic language framework for semantic web","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Ontologies","Resource description framework","Information retrieval","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","semantic Web","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic Web","Arabic text","ontology","optimization","English content","Arabic language processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["semantic web","ontology learning","semantic query","semantic framework","ontology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Arabic language framework for semantic web","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192178","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"28-29 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Arabic language framework for semantic web","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"10majdi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091327S","chronDate":"28-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976947","isNumber":"5995747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976947","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5995747","articleId":"5995757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5995794,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Mohamed","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Faculty of Information Science and Technology, UKM, Bangi, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37415865900"},{"name":"Nazlia Omar","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Faculty of Information Science and Technology, UKM, Bangi, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nazlia","lastName":"Omar","id":"37547240800"},{"name":"Mohd Juzaidin Ab Aziz","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Faculty of Information Science and Technology, UKM, Bangi, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Juzaidin Ab","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37543463100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-353-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-354-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0697"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-0700"}],"articleNumber":"5995794","dbTime":"49 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Hidden Markov models","Tagging","Dictionaries","Markov processes","Training","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","natural language processing","speech processing","statistical distributions","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical Malay part-of-speech tagger","natural language processing","statistical POS tagger","trigram hidden Markov model","Malay language sentences","training corpus","linear successive abstraction","probability distribution","prefix information","suffix information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["part of speech","POS tagger","HMM","Malay POS"]}],"abstract":"Assigning part of speech to running words in a sentence is one of the pipeline processes in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, a statistical POS tagger using trigram Hidden Markov Model for tagging Malay language sentences is examined. The problem of the tagger approach is to predict the POS for unseen words in the training corpus that can guess word's POS based on their surrounding information. The predictor has been built based on information of word's prefixes, suffixes or combination of them. Linear successive abstraction has been used for smoothing the probability distribution of part of speech for unknown Malay words given their prefixes or suffixes information. However, for the combination of prefixes and suffixes information, the joint probability distribution has been used. The best performance to predict POS of unknown words are obtained through prefixes information by seeing the first three characters of the words. The accuracy of the tagging is 67.9%. This shows that a statistical tagger for Malay language using Hidden Markov Model is able to predict any unknown word's POS at some promising accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995794","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Semantic Technology and Information Retrieval","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Semantic Technology and Information Retrieval","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976947/5995747/05995794.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical malay part-of-speech (POS) tagger using Hidden Markov approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995794/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical malay part-of-speech (POS) tagger using Hidden Markov approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12192215","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5995794/","conferenceDate":"28-29 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical malay part-of-speech (POS) tagger using Hidden Markov approach","confLoc":"Putrajaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"47hassan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098387S","chronDate":"28-29 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976947","isNumber":"5995747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976947","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5995747","articleId":"5995794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5995856,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Azeredo-Leme","affiliation":["Synopsys Inc., Oeiras, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7384/5995850/5995856/5995856-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlos azeredo-leme (M'86).

FinFET based SRAM design has been proposed as an alternative solution to the bulk devices. It can be inferred from the results that with increase in the width of driver FinFET, the high SNM reduces and low SNM increases. This is due the fact that the leakage current is considerably reduced due to increased control of the FinFET device structure, resulting relatively in highI\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">on</sub>\n/I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">off</sub>\nratio. Further, the effect of process variation on the SRAM cell performance was analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation on HSPICE. The Monte Carlo simulation results for RNM and WNM to quantify the effect of process variation arising due to variation in FinFET's widths. The simulation was carried out for 1000 values, assuming 3\u03c3 equal to 10% of the mean value. Two structures of the FinFET viz. the standard PTM model and an underlapped FinFET have been also used for the simulations. It was identified that while the relative levels of the noise margins were lower for the underlapped case, the standard deviation was considerably lower too. In this work we also analyze the effect of temperature on noise margins and static power for FinFET based SRAM cell. FinFET is suitable for future nanoscale memory circuits design due to its reduced Short Channel Effects (SCE) and leakage current.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5995858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"thirdquarter  2011","volume":"11","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12213656","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"thirdquarter 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5995858/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nanoscale FinFET Based SRAM Cell Design: Analysis of Performance Metric, Process Variation, Underlapped FinFET, and Temperature Effect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanoscale FinFET Based SRAM Cell Design: Analysis of Performance Metric, Process Variation, Underlapped FinFET, and Temperature Effect","sourcePdf":"11mcas03-raj.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088352S","chronDate":"thirdquarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"5995850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5995850","articleId":"5995858","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5996013,"authors":[{"name":"Chanwoo Cho","affiliation":["Department of Industrial & Information Systems Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chanwoo Cho","id":"37966376500"},{"name":"Sungjoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Industrial & Information Systems Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungjoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37966135300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-952-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-951-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-950-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5996013","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industries","Strategic planning","Business","Taxonomy","Manufacturing","Standardization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["research and development","service industries","strategic planning","taxation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["taxonomy","technology roadmaps","service areas","service industries","business models","strategic planning","servitization","R&D planning","manufacturing firms","roadmap formats"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service planning","Technology roadmap","Taxonomy","Classification","Strategic planning"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the importance of services in the economy has been rapidly increasing, and dominating trends of industries has been moving toward services. Many corporations recognized that the adoption of services into their manufacturing processes can create new opportunities and started to improve their business models by combining product offerings with service offerings. Under the circumstance of this servitization, a tool for strategic planning in the service area is in urgent need. To meet the need, this research focuses on the possibilities of using technology roadmap as a tool for service planning. Roadmap is a popular planning tool for products and technologies, which helps align R&D plans with business needs. Though the existing roadmaps have emphasized their use in product or R&D planning, it can also be a powerful tool for service planning. For manufacturing firms, roadmap can help combine their product plannings with service plannings, since it is useful for integrated planning. On the other hand, for service firms, it can incorporate technology planning into their service planning, where the importance of technology has increasingly emphasized. For the purpose, this research purposes to develop taxonomy of technology roadmaps in the service areas, taking a bottom-up approach by collecting the existing roadmaps in the service areas and analyzing their characteristics in terms of roadmapping purposes and roadmap formats. The bottom-up approach is adopted in this research because roadmaps have been developed as a management practice not a management theory and thus investigating roadmaps in use will give meaningful implications for exploring the possibilities of using roadmaps for service planning. The research results are expected to provide meaningful information about roadmaps for those who are in charge of strategic planning in the service industry.","doi":"10.1109/ITMC.2011.5996013","publicationTitle":"First International Technology Management Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Technology Management Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981578/5995918/05996013.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITMC.2011.5996013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5995918","startPage":"462","endPage":"467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Taxonomy of technology roadmaps in service areas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996013","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Taxonomy of technology roadmaps in service areas","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996013/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12193831","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5996013/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Taxonomy of technology roadmaps in service areas","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D23057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080107S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981578","isNumber":"5995918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981578","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5995918","articleId":"5996013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5996151,"authors":[{"name":"Kumaraguru Prabakar","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5983456/5996097/5996151/5996151-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Kumaraguru Prabakar received his B.

Dry band arcing is a phenomenon observed in ADSS cable, which damages the outer surface of the cable. Damages due to dry band arcing damper and cable are observed in the field. Effect of spiral vibration dampers on dry band arcing is investigated by performing experiments on cable samples. Leakage current measurements from the experiments are recorded. Simulation is performed to reproduce the experimental samples using commercially available software and the electric field distribution on the surface of the cable for two models is simulated. The simulation result is used to analyze the behavior of the arc. When the dampers are installed, an increase in the leakage current and electric field distribution is observed. A possible remedy could be to move the dampers near the middle of the span without reducing its effectiveness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIC.2011.5996151","publicationTitle":"2011 Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC).","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC).","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983456/5996097/05996151.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"230","doi":"10.1109/EIC.2011.5996151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental investigation of dry band arcing on ADSS cables when spiral vibration dampers are installed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Experimental investigation of dry band arcing on ADSS cables when spiral vibration dampers are installed","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5996151/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12194070","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996151/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental investigation of dry band arcing on ADSS cables when spiral vibration dampers are installed","confLoc":"Annapolis, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081192S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983456","isNumber":"5996097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983456","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5996097","articleId":"5996151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5996225,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The considered ROADMs are based on two optical filters, fibre-Bragg grating (FBG) and a wavelength-blocker (WB)/wavelength selective switch (WSS) device. It is shown that adaptive modulation can enhance the network tolerance not only to the GDR, but also to the pass-band loss ripple (LR) and frequencies dip, leading also to an improved system performance of up to about 60% in comparison with conventional identical modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 16th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983497/5996215/05996239.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2011 16th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group delay ripple reduction in cascaded ROADMs by adaptively modulated optical OFDM signals for Metro/Regional networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Optical fiber filters","Optical fibers","Optical fiber networks","Fiber gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","Bragg gratings","OFDM modulation","optical fibres","optical transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group delay ripple reduction","cascaded ROADM","modulated optical OFDM signal","optical OFDM transceiver","adaptive modulation","intensity modulation","transparent metro/regional network system","cascaded reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer","optical filters","fibre-Bragg grating","wavelength blocker","wavelength selective switch device","network tolerance","pass-band loss ripple","identical modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Group delay ripple reduction in cascaded ROADMs by adaptively modulated optical OFDM signals for Metro/Regional networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996239/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12194212","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group delay ripple reduction in cascaded ROADMs by adaptively modulated optical OFDM signals for Metro/Regional networks","confLoc":"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"CPI2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054498S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983497","isNumber":"5996215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983497","xplore-issue":"5996215","articleId":"5996239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5996244,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Pu","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Pu","id":"37396577200"},{"name":"Weixin He","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Weixin","lastName":"He","id":"37956722800"},{"name":"Zhihu Wei","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zhihu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37955455200"},{"name":"Guodan Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Guodan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404007800"},{"name":"Rong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406144100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-86135-373-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-753-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5996244","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Decoding","Laser theory","Laser mode locking","Bragg gratings","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","code division multiplexing","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-effective laser source","endecoder technoloy","OCDMA system","coherent encoding","ultra-short laser","gain switched laser feasibility","data modulation","TPS-SSFBG technology","EPS-SSFBG technology"]}],"abstract":"Coherent encoding with ultra-short laser is a kind of promising advanced OCDMA system scheme. gain switched laser's feasibility for the advanced OCDMA system is analyzed experimentally.

No polarization coordinate alignment is needed and the complexity is thus reduced. The unconditional bit error rate (BER) expression for DCPOLSK in a weak turbulence has been derived, and its performance is compared with the coherent amplitude shift keying (ASK) and the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) employing a single subcarrier. DCPOLSK scheme is highly insensitive to the phase noise of the phase lock loop (PLL) in contrast to the BPSK scheme. We also show that DCPOLSK requires ~3 dB lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in order to achieve the same BER in a weak turbulence environment compared to the ASK scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 16th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983497/5996215/05996255.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"152","publicationTitle":"2011 16th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential circular polarization shift keying with heterodyne detection for free space optical links with turbulence channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical polarization","Lead","Silicon","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","optical links","phase locked loops","phase shift keying","turbulence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterodyne detection","free space optical links","turbulence channel","coherent differential circular polarization shift keying","free space optical communications","unconditional bit error rate expression","amplitude shift keying","binary phase shift keying","phase lock loop signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Differential circular polarization shift keying with heterodyne detection for free space optical links with turbulence channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996255/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12194226","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential circular polarization shift keying with heterodyne detection for free space optical links with turbulence channel","confLoc":"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"OCG4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050301S","chronDate":"20-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983497","isNumber":"5996215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983497","xplore-issue":"5996215","articleId":"5996255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"NOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5996275,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Job-shop scheduling is a critical element in job/task completion. This schedule consists of a sequence of doing consecutive jobs in a minimum amount of time. In addition, any conflict between the raw materials used in each job and its resource pool are to be avoided. This research applied the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method which is implemented in Temporal Difference Learning (TDL). Furthermore, the TDL focused on the Gradient-Descent method in which the Radial Basis Function Neural Network served as the approximation function. The input of this research was an initial critical path with no conflict-free schedule. Using the above methods, the conflict(s) could be eliminated gradually. Thus, the flexible job-shop scheduling can readily be made by any manufacturing company. Language used for this research is the Borland Delphi 7.0. All object structure and methods are made as easy as possible so that it can be implemented on the same problem with different application.","doi":"10.1109/APBITM.2011.5996285","startPage":"29","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Summer Conference of Asia Pacific Business Innovation and Technology Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981418/5996278/05996285.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Summer Conference of Asia Pacific Business Innovation and Technology Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APBITM.2011.5996285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement learning combined with radial basis function neural network to solve Job-Shop scheduling problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Learning","Indexes","Resource description framework","Job shop scheduling","Resource management","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","gradient methods","job shop scheduling","learning (artificial intelligence)","radial basis function networks","raw materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning","radial basis function neural network","Job-Shop Scheduling Problem","manufacturing companies","multiple machines","raw materials","gradient-descent method","approximation function","conflict-free schedule","Borland Delphi 7.0"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine","industry","job-shop scheduling","reinforcement learning","radial basis function neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement learning combined with radial basis function neural network to solve Job-Shop scheduling problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996285/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12192649","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement learning combined with radial basis function neural network to solve Job-Shop scheduling problem","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"00071018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032717S","chronDate":"10-12 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981418","isNumber":"5996278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981418","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5996278","articleId":"5996285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5996368,"authors":[{"name":"Wael M.

The numerical results offer that the criterion using the square of the absolute value of the determinant of the channel matrix is most effective in terms of BER performance and calculation amount.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996379","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996379.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna selection criterion suitable for indoor LOS scenarios for two-stream MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996379/","displayDocTitle":"Antenna selection criterion suitable for indoor LOS scenarios for two-stream MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214258","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996379/","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna selection criterion suitable for indoor LOS scenarios for two-stream MIMO systems","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07452S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5996381,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37534884900"},{"name":"Xu Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403255900"},{"name":"Zhijun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279625900"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5996381","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"abstract":"Performance of Multi-User Multi-Input Multi-Output (MU-MIMO) systems with a 15-port compact antenna cube is measured and studied in typical scenarios proposed in this paper. The cube provides 15 individual channels and is ideal for Multiuser MIMO communications, especially when transmit antenna selection technology is adapted. Experimental measurements were carried out to evaluate the performance of the antenna cube in different scenarios for multiuser MIMO communications. The results show that multiuser MIMO systems with the proposed compact antenna cube as AP antennas outperform those with dipole antennas which occupy the same number of RF channels but with much

Unlike SISO systems where multipath fading is something to be overcome, MIMO takes advantage of fading to identify and use orthogonal communication channels to enable simultaneous transmission of multiple streams of data. A consequence of this is that the fading channel characteristics are an integral part of the test conditions and directly influence the measured MIMO OTA performance. The major test challenge for MIMO OTA is how to create a repeatable scenario which accurately reflects the MIMO antenna radiation performance in a realistic wireless propagation environment. This paper describes a novel cost-effective test method based on antenna pattern measurement.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996385","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996385.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","startPage":"71","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-stage over the air (OTA) test method for MIMO device performance evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-stage over the air (OTA) test method for MIMO device performance evaluation","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996385/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214263","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5996385/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-stage over the air (OTA) test method for MIMO device performance evaluation","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070285S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5996386,"authors":[{"name":"Geyi Wen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wave Scattering and Remote Sensing Information, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China"],"firstName":"Geyi","lastName":"Wen","id":"37087069950"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5996386","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Wireless communication","Scattering","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel estimation","MIMO communication","S-matrix theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity estimation","MIMO systems","perturbation technique","channel matrix","scattering environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","capacity","antenna","channel matrix"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of channel capacity of MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996386","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996386","startPage":"75","endPage":"78","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996386.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","abstract":"In this article we present a method for evaluating the channel matrix of an arbitrary MIMO system in a general scattering environment by making use of a perturbation technique.

One part of this coordination that is becoming increasingly important is the authentication of nodes requesting network access.

This paper experimentally quantifies the authentication accuracy improvements achieved when applying such techniques to multiple-input multiple-output systems. It further studies an information theoretic technique for determining which radiometric features are most effective in discriminating different devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996476.pdf","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1112","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying MIMO wireless devices based on radiometric signatures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Performance evaluation","Radiometry","Training","Object recognition","Radio transmitters","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","MIMO communication","radio networks","radiometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO wireless device","radiometric signature","cognitive radio network","authentication accuracy improvement","multiple-input multiple-output wireless device","spectrum access","waveform transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Identifying MIMO wireless devices based on radiometric signatures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996476/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214347","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying MIMO wireless devices based on radiometric signatures","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11122S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5996478,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The total efficiency, as seen by each port, includes the impedance mismatch, i.e., input reflection coefficient, and this must be considered in a multiport context.

The approach presented in this paper is a matrix method which gives an insightful general expression for the input reflection coefficient for any N.

The resonance, radiation and specific absorption rate (SAR) performance of the antenna is evaluated and design modifications are suggested to overcome the inherent detuning effect.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","startPage":"392","endPage":"395","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996726.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a novel miniature antenna implanted in the human head for wireless biotelemetry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Skin","Dipole antennas","Biological system modeling","Biomedical telemetry","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","biomedical electronics","telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniature antenna","wireless biotelemetry","biocompatible antenna","medical implant communications service","skin tissue simulating box","anatomical human head model","specific absorption rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biocompatibility","finite difference time domain (FDTD)","implantable antenna","medical implant communications service (MICS) band","specific absorption rate (SAR)","wireless biotelemetry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a novel miniature antenna implanted in the human head for wireless biotelemetry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996726/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996726/","accessionNumber":"12214590","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a novel miniature antenna implanted in the human head for wireless biotelemetry","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05306S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5996752,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Poli","affiliation":["ELEDIA Research Group @ DISI, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Poli","id":"37540624900"},{"name":"Giacomo Oliveri","affiliation":["ELEDIA Research Group @ DISI, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Giacomo","lastName":"Oliveri","id":"37410828400"},{"name":"Paolo Rocca","affiliation":["ELEDIA Research Group @ DISI, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Rocca","id":"37312597400"},{"name":"Andrea Massa","affiliation":["ELEDIA Research Group @ DISI, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Massa","id":"37274841000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5996752","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave imaging","Microwave theory and techniques","Dielectrics","Inverse problems","Microwave antennas","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian compressive sensing","model-based inversion algorithm","inverse scattering problem","contrast source formulation","sparsity constraint","retrieved contrast source"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microwave imaging","model-based inversion algorithms","compressive sampling"]}],"abstract":"A model-based inversion algorithm is presented within the contrast source formulation of the inverse scattering problem.

An optimization method of solving for array weights and simulated examples are given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996894/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12214754","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996894/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Directional modulation and coding in arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional modulation and coding in arrays","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058138S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5996902,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Jouny","affiliation":["Lafayette College, Easton, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Jouny","id":"37275162300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5996902","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1513},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Direction of arrival estimation","Compressed sensing","Multiple signal classification","Radar antennas","Signal resolution","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["music DOA estimation","compressive sensing","compressive arrays","direction of arrival","antenna array","array manifold","radar scattering signatures","stepped frequency radar","array resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DOA","compressive sampling","antenna arrays"]}],"abstract":"This paper examines the pros and cons of compressed sensing in estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) of sparse signals impinging on an antenna array. The observed signal received by each antenna element may be compressed (temporally [2]) assuming that it is sparse (a valid assumption when dealing with real radar target signature), and the arrays receiving these signals may also be compressed (spatially) by compressing the array manifold from M antennas to Ms antennas according to some random sampling scheme [1,3]. The performance of both approaches is assessed via simulations involving real and synthetic radar scattering signatures obtained using stepped frequency radar. Of particular interest is the impact on array resolution and the ability of compressively sampled antenna array to resolve correlated arrivals.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996902","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Music DOA estimation with compressive sensing and/or compressive arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Music DOA estimation with compressive sensing and/or compressive arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996902/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214762","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5996902/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Music DOA estimation with compressive sensing and/or compressive arrays","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"02016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040811S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5996907,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond J.

An efficient freespace beamforming algorithm, implemented with the fast Fourier/inverse Fourier transform (FFT/IFFT), is presented for the building layout imaging.

Measured and simulated data are presented in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact multiband antenna with MIMO implementation for USB size 4G LTE wireless devices","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996955","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996955.pdf","startPage":"2215","endPage":"2218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A compact multiband antenna with MIMO implementation for USB size 4G LTE wireless devices","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996955/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214815","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact multiband antenna with MIMO implementation for USB size 4G LTE wireless devices","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"02215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044689S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5996956,"authors":[{"name":"Haider R.

A dual-band MNG metamaterial is designed to specifically possess negative effective permeability at the two resonant frequencies where the antennas are operating. MNG is inserted between the two printed monopoles (back to back) to decrease the correlation between them. The printed monopole antennas were designed to operate in the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) bands 2.45 GHz and 5.2 GHz. Antenna characteristics such as, scattering parameters far-field radiation patterns with and without the presence of MNG are provided. The design of the MNG unit cell and its effective constitutive parameters are also provided. Design and simulations are conducted using Ansoft's HFSS software which is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The proposed technique achieved a 14 dB reduction in mutual coupling at 2.45 GHz and 13 dB at 5.2 GHz. A gain of 2 dB higher than the normal case at the second band is observed while it is maintained the same on the first band. Furthermore, the MNG based antenna system maintains a relatively low profile (16 mm) which is convenient for compact systems and hand-held devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996956.pdf","startPage":"2219","endPage":"2222","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual coupling reduction of dual-band printed monopoles using MNG metamaterial","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metamaterials","Mutual coupling","Antenna radiation patterns","MIMO","Permeability","Dual band"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","finite element analysis","metamaterial antennas","metamaterials","microreactors","microstrip antennas","MIMO communication","monopole antennas","multifrequency antennas","permeability","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual coupling reduction","dual-band printed monopoles","MNG metamaterial","\u03bc-negative metamaterial","dual-band printed monopole antennas","multiple input multiple output","MIMO","negative effective permeability","resonant frequencies","wireless local area network","WLAN bands","antenna characteristics","scattering parameters far-field radiation patterns","MNG unit cell design","constitutive parameters","Ansoft HFSS software","finite element method","FEM","hand-held devices","frequency 2.45 GHz to 5.2 GHz","gain 2 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","MNG","Metamaterial","Mutual coupling","Printed monopole antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mutual coupling reduction of dual-band printed monopoles using MNG metamaterial","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5996956/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214816","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual coupling reduction of dual-band printed monopoles using MNG metamaterial","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"02219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08363S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5996957,"authors":[{"name":"Minseok Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Minseok","lastName":"Han","id":"37532226100"},{"name":"Jaehoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5996957","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1491},"abstract":"A compact dual-band MIMO antenna using a symmetric slotted structure is proposed for next generation USB dongle applications.

The proposed MIMO antenna has an isolation of approximately 20 dB at LTE band 13 and the envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) of the two antennas is less than 0.2 over the whole LTE band 13.

Numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed fields and its compensations.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5996972","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05996972.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5996972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","startPage":"2278","endPage":"2281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic fields of a focused beam with higher-order compensations for FDTD TF/SF formulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5996972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytic fields of a focused beam with higher-order compensations for FDTD TF/SF formulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5996972/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214832","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5996972/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic fields of a focused beam with higher-order compensations for FDTD TF/SF formulation","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"02278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045782S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5996972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5996974,"authors":[{"name":"\u0130lker R. \u00c7apo\u011flu","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"\u0130lker R.","lastName":"\u00c7apo\u011flu","id":"38229543400"},{"name":"Allen Taflove","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Allen","lastName":"Taflove","id":"37280689500"},{"name":"Vadim Backman","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Vadim","lastName":"Backman","id":"37279126900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5996974","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beams","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Optimized production technology","GSM","Laser modes","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","laser beams","light coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD simulation","partially coherent Gaussian Schell model beam","quasimonochromatic Gaussian Schell model beam incidence","cross-spectral density","coherent mode decomposition","plane wave decomposition method","angular spectrum method","coherent mode excitation"]}],"abstract":"We describe the FDTD implementation of quasi-monochromatic Gaussian Schell model (GSM) beam incidence, which is frequently used to model partial coherence effects in lasers.

The proposed method first linearizes the otherwise non-linear FEM matrix dependence with respect to the geometry variation, and then uses a uniformly sampled balanced truncation proper orthogonal decomposition (BT-POD) reduction algorithm to expediently sweep over the parametric geometry space. The approach avoids slow re-meshing and full matrix reassembly by using mesh morphing approaches. Moreover, BT-POD is known to provide close to optimal size reduced problems using only a small number of samples, thus minimizing the the number of full-model solutions.

Its lack of robustness, however, means that it is vulnerable to array calibration errors and other model errors. To overcome this problem, numerous Robust Capon beamforming algorithms have been proposed, which are much more promising for practical applications. In this paper, an FPGA implementation of a Robust Capon Beamforming algorithm is investigated and presented, which deals with wideband real-valued signals in time domain. This realization takes an array input with 8 channels, computes the adaptive weight vectors for beamforming with an 18 bit fixed-point representation and runs at an 80 MHz clock on Xilinx V4 FPGA. The outcomes will be applied to a medical imaging project.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5997120","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05997120.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5997120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","startPage":"2849","endPage":"2852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of wideband time domain Robust Capon Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5997120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of wideband time domain Robust Capon Beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997120/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214970","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5997120/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of wideband time domain Robust Capon Beamforming","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"02849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051559S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5997120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5997142,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Then it becomes a difficult task to optimize all the parameters simultaneously for specified frequencies of operation. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based algorithm have been developed to decide the patch dimensions of dual band square stacked patch antenna (SPA) operating in the X/Ku band. The cost function for the PSO is evaluated with the help of trained neural network (NN) to reduce the lengthy simulation time. The results from this PSO based CAD model have been cross verified with the experimental results for some typical stacked patch antennas.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5997142","startPage":"2932","endPage":"2935","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05997142.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5997142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based particle swarm optimizer for design of dual resonance X/Ku band stacked patch antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Microstrip antennas","Artificial neural networks","Microstrip","Patch antennas","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","microstrip antennas","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual resonance X-Ku band stacked patch microstrip antenna design","neural network based particle swarm optimization","multiband operation","neural network based PSO","dual band square stacked patch antenna","dual band square SPA","PSO based CAD model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stacked patch antenna","neural network","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based particle swarm optimizer for design of dual resonance X/Ku band stacked patch antenna","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5997142/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based particle swarm optimizer for design of dual resonance X/Ku band stacked patch antenna","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"02932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122961S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5997142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5997155,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Development of wafer-level integrated terahertz receiver front-end by using advanced semiconductor fabrication technologies and use of novel integrated antennas with silicon micromachining are reported. We report novel stacking of micromachined silicon wafers which allows for the 3-dimensional integration of various terahertz receiver components in extremely small packages which easily leads to the development of 2-dimensional multi-pixel receiver front-ends in the terahertz frequency range. We also report an integrated micro-lens antenna that goes with the silicon micro-machined front-end. The micro-lens antenna is fed by a waveguide that excites a silicon lens antenna through a leaky-wave or electromagnetic band gap (EBG) resonant cavity. We utilized advanced semiconductor nanofabrication techniques to design, fabricate, and demonstrate a super-compact, low-mass submillimeter-wave heterodyne front-end. When the micro-lens antenna is integrated with the receiver front-end we will be able to assemble integrated heterodyne array receivers for various applications such as multi-pixel high resolution spectrometer and imaging radar at terahertz frequencies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997162/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12215011","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5997162/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Integrated arrays on silicon at terahertz frequencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated arrays on silicon at terahertz frequencies","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"03007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065436S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5997162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5997179,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Thajudeen","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Thajudeen","id":"37542286200"},{"name":"Ahmad Hoorfar","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Hoorfar","id":"38505574800"},{"name":"Wenji Zhang","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenji","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37597069000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5997179","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflection","Radar imaging","Parameter estimation","Frequency dependence","Time domain analysis","Imaging","Permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","parameter estimation","radar imaging","time-domain reflectometry","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-dependent parameter estimation","enhanced through-the-wall imaging","ultrawideband radar","time-domain reflectometry method","TDR method","dielectric constant","norm-difference algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parameter estimation","through-the-wall radar imaging","auto-focusing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the frequency dependent constitutive parameters of an unknown wall, when interrogated by a ultra-wideband radar, are estimated using a norm-difference algorithm. In this approach, we first apply a technique based on the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method, which assumes the wall parameters are constant, to quickly obtain an estimate of the dielectric constant, loss-tangent, and the thickness of the wall. Using the initial estimated parameters, the proposed norm-difference algorithm is then applied to estimate the wall's constitutive parameters for each frequency step over the entire band of the radar signal. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed frequency domain wall parameter estimation technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of frequency-dependent parameters of unknown walls for enhanced through-the-wall imaging","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2011.5997179","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981577/5996365/05997179.pdf","startPage":"3070","endPage":"3073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2011.5997179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5996365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5997179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of frequency-dependent parameters of unknown walls for enhanced through-the-wall imaging","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5997179/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12215028","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of frequency-dependent parameters of unknown walls for enhanced through-the-wall imaging","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"03070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050583S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981577","isNumber":"5996365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981577","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5996365","articleId":"5997179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5997201,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoxin Peng","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shaoxin","lastName":"Peng","id":"37961281600"},{"name":"Chao-Fu Wang","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chao-Fu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280017600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9563-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9562-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9561-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5997201","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Instruction sets","Acceleration","Moment methods","Central Processing Unit","Programming","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","graphical user interfaces","method of moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware accelerated MoM-PFFT method","graphics processing units","parallel efficiency","acceleration ratio","memory reading","shared memory usage","method of moment","precorrected-FFT"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the implementation of the MoM-PFFT method on GPU is presented.

At the same time, these applications need to use a phased-array concept in order to cope with the associated free space path loss. By sequentially rotating linearly-polarized antenna elements, circular polarization can be obtained in a phased-array. Calibration is required to obtain a low axial ratio when scanning the beam off-broadside. The purpose of this paper is to show the effect of phase and amplitude quantization on the calibration accuracy of the axial ratio. Measured results from a 60 GHz demonstrator are used to investigate the required accuracy of the phase- and amplitude setting of each of the array elements.

We present SER characterizations with and without ISI, and show that the effect of ISI, especially for higher order modulation schemes, e.g., 8PSK and above, can be very severe, irrespective of the number of diversity branches.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081210.090609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/05997281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081210.090609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","startPage":"2703","endPage":"2715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Rate for PSK and QAM Modulations for Non-Ideal OFDM Systems with Noisy Channel Estimates and Receive Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5997281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error Rate for PSK and QAM Modulations for Non-Ideal OFDM Systems with Noisy Channel Estimates and Receive Diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317751","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5997281/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Rate for PSK and QAM Modulations for Non-Ideal OFDM Systems with Noisy Channel Estimates and Receive Diversity","sourcePdf":"2703-tc1110-montojo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116205S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"5997281","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5997283,"authors":[{"name":"Menguc Oner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Eng, Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Menguc","lastName":"Oner","id":"37268389500"},{"name":"Octavia A.

This method consists of matching the first and high-order derivatives of the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) function of the variable node set to the corresponding derivatives of the inverse EXIT function of the check node set, in order to reduce the gap between the two curves in the EXIT chart.

The jointly-correlated MIMO channel (or the Weichselberger model) accounts for the correlation at two link ends and is shown to be highly accurate to model real channels. Classically, numerical techniques together with Monte-Carlo methods (named stochastic programming) are used to resolve the problem concerned but at a high computational cost. To tackle this, we derive the asymptotic sum-rate of the multiuser (MU) MIMO uplink channel in the large-system regime where the numbers of antennas at the transmitters and the receiver go to infinity with constant ratios. Several insights are gained from the analytic asymptotic sum-rate expression, based on which an efficient optimization algorithm is further proposed to obtain the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that even for a moderate number of antennas at each link, the new approach provides indistinguishable results as those obtained by the complex stochastic programming approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/05997288.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081111.100585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081111.100585","startPage":"2883","endPage":"2895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Sum-Rate of Multiuser MIMO Uplink Channels with Jointly-Correlated Rician Fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997288/","displayDocTitle":"On the Sum-Rate of Multiuser MIMO Uplink Channels with Jointly-Correlated Rician Fading","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5997288/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12317754","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Sum-Rate of Multiuser MIMO Uplink Channels with Jointly-Correlated Rician Fading","sourcePdf":"2883-tc1110-wen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109795S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"5997288","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5997289,"authors":[{"name":"James C.

Using a linear minimal mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver at the destination node, we demonstrate that the optimal amplifying matrix at each relay node can be viewed as a linear MMSE filter concatenated with another linear filter. As a consequence, the MSE matrix of the signal waveform estimation at the destination node is decomposed into the sum of the MSE matrices at all relay nodes. We show that at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment, this MSE matrix decomposition significantly simplifies the solution to the problem of optimizing the source precoding matrices and relay amplifying matrices. Simulation results show that even at the low to medium SNR range, the simplified optimization algorithms have only a marginal performance degradation but a greatly reduced computational complexity and signalling overhead compared with the existing optimal iterative algorithm, and thus are of great interest for practical relay systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081111.100756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/05997290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081111.100756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","startPage":"2896","endPage":"2904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Algorithms for Optimizing Multiuser Multi-Hop MIMO Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5997290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Algorithms for Optimizing Multiuser Multi-Hop MIMO Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317755","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5997290/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Algorithms for Optimizing Multiuser Multi-Hop MIMO Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"2896-tc1110-rong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07579S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"5997290","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5997293,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Ho Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6069922/5997293/5997293-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan-Ho Chen (S'10) received the B.S. degree from Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2004, and 2011, respectively.","He is now a postdoctoral research fellow at IC Design Laboratory in the Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University.

An 8 \u00d7 8 GPEB Booth multiplier improves more than 88% on the reduction of absolute average error compared with the traditional direct truncation (D-T) multiplier, and more than 32% area savings is obtained in the GPEB Booth multiplier compared with posttrun cation (P-T) Booth multiplier. By the same power consumption, the GPEB Booth multipliers can achieve higher accuracy than the existing works. Besides, considering power efficiency with accuracy, the proposed GPEB Booth multiplier has the most power-efficiency compared with other methods. Furthermore, the GPEB Booth multipliers are implemented in the circuit of two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT). Compared with traditional Booth multiplier's applications, the proposed 2-D DCT cores can reduce about 18% area cost with the penalty of only 0.8 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

The intrinsic advantages of UTB SOI technology versus bulk CMOS technology with regard to the stability and variability of 6T SRAM cells for subthreshold operation are analyzed. Compared with LER, WFV causes comparable threshold voltage variation and much smaller subthreshold swing fluctuation, hence less impact on the UTB SOI subthreshold SRAMs. Even considering LER, the Lg=40 nm UTB SOI 6T subthreshold SRAM cells still provide sufficient margin (\u03bcRSNM/\u03c3RSNM >; 6 at Vdd=0.3 ~ 0.4 V) while the bulk subthreshold SRAMs with RDF fail to maintain adequate margin. Increasing temperature will increase the Vread, 0 and decrease RSNM because of the degraded subthreshold swing. The RSNM of UTB SOI subthreshold SRAMs show less temperature sensitivity compared with that of bulk subthreshold SRAMs. Due to larger body effect, the back-gating technique is more efficient for the Lg=40 nm and 25 nm UTB SOI subthreshold SRAMs compared with the bulk counterparts. By using lower threshold voltage devices with dual band-gap work functions, the Lg=25 nm UTB SOI subthreshold SRAMs show 31.9% reduction in \u03c3RSNM and 55% improvement in \u03bcRSNM/\u03c3RSNM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12331849","htmlLink":"/document/5997294/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Ultra-Thin-Body SOI Subthreshold SRAM Considering Line-Edge Roughness, Work Function Variation, and Temperature Sensitivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Ultra-Thin-Body SOI Subthreshold SRAM Considering Line-Edge Roughness, Work Function Variation, and Temperature Sensitivity","sourcePdf":"jetcas-hu-2163691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092712S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6069922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6069922","articleId":"5997294","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5997295,"authors":[{"name":"Omeed Momeni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/5997295/5997295-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omeed Momeni (S'03) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

Two prototypes are developed. A partially shielded tunable filter using varactor-loaded split-ring resonators is developed to verify the design method and to demonstrate the wide tuning range of a tunable filter. To further extend the tuning range, a filter bank with three stacked tunable filters at different frequency bands are designed and developed.

A multinomial logistic regression (MLR) algorithm is first used to learn the posterior probability distributions from the spectral information, using a subspace projection method to better characterize noise and highly mixed pixels. Then, contextual information is included using a multilevel logistic Markov-Gibbs Markov random field prior. Finally, a maximum a posteriori segmentation is efficiently computed by the min-cut-based integer optimization algorithm. The proposed segmentation approach is experimentally evaluated using both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance when compared with recently introduced hyperspectral image classification methods. The integration of subspace projection methods with the MLR algorithm, combined with the use of spatial-contextual information, represents an innovative contribution in the literature.

Each feature has its particular contribution to the unified representation determined by simultaneously optimizing the weights in the objective function.

The sensors transmit their observation signals using the analog amplify and forward scheme through coherent multiaccess channels to the fusion center, which reconstructs a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate of the physical quantity observed. We consider three power allocation schemes: 1) equal power allocation (EPA); 2) short-term optimal power allocation (ST-OPA), where we minimize the distortion subject to a power constraint at each time step; and 3) long-term optimal power allocation (LT-OPA), where we minimize the distortion outage probability subject to a long-term average power constraint. We study their diversity orders of distortion outage in terms of increasing numbers of sensors, and show that under Rayleigh fading EPA and ST-OPA achieve the same diversity order of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\nlog\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n is the number of sensors.

We point out that for finite backhaul capacity a tradeoff between sharing user data, which allows for full MIMO cooperation, and not doing so, which reduces the setup to an interference channel but also requires less overhead, emerges. We optimize this tradeoff by formulating a rate splitting approach in which non-shared data (private to each transmitter) and shared data are superimposed. We derive the corresponding achievable rate region and obtain the optimal beamforming design for both shared and private symbols. We illustrate how the capacity of the backhaul determines how much of the user data is worth sharing across multiple BSs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5997324/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12358029","volume":"59","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Data Sharing in Multicell MIMO With Finite Backhaul Capacity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Data Sharing in Multicell MIMO With Finite Backhaul Capacity","sourcePdf":"tsp-zakhour-2165949-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05988S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"5997324","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5997327,"authors":[{"name":"Bappi Barua","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Bappi","lastName":"Barua","id":"37295969600"},{"name":"Mehran Abolhasan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Abolhasan","id":"37282203000"},{"name":"Farzad Safaei","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Safaei","id":"37269428700"},{"name":"Daniel R.

to the lower energy density, the randomness and the instability of the wind energy, it is difficult to control the large-scale wind turbine generators. Based on the domestic megawatt wind turbine generator system, the pitch control techniques for large scale wind turbine are deeply analyzed in this thesis. The basic law of pitch control is analyzed on the basis of the theory of wind turbine blade aerodynamics, and then a design of individual pitch control is proposed. By the use of neural networks, a new strategy of control individual pitch control (IPC) which is based on inflow angle prediction is put forward. By means of simulation results, it can be concluded that IPC can effectively reduce the aerodynamic fatigue load on blades, and the result of power control is prefect.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASE.2011.5997550","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996073/5997514/05997550.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems Engineering (CASE)","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems Engineering (CASE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASE.2011.5997550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5997514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Neural Network Technology in the Individual Pitch Control System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of Neural Network Technology in the Individual Pitch Control System","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12208373","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5997550/","conferenceDate":"30-31 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Neural Network Technology in the Individual Pitch Control System","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pid1096540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033017S","chronDate":"30-31 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996073","isNumber":"5997514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996073","xplore-issue":"5997514","articleId":"5997550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5997558,"authors":[{"name":"Li-ye Liu","firstName":"Li-ye","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087071217"},{"name":"Cui-hong Ma","firstName":"Cui-hong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37087071306"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0860-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0859-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0858-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5997558","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5997558","abstract":"Aiming at the parameters of fuzzy controller and CMAC neural network are difficult to tune,GA is introduced to the control system to optimize the parameters of fuzzy CMAC neural network.

DACs are driven to generate the waveforms by clock signals, which are obtained from the reshaping and shape lifting of output from DDS by clock distributor. The data to build waveform up are stored in cache and loaded into DACs continuously by FPGA. An embedded process was set up in FPGA and would interpolate data from envelope when output of whole system is required to be typical reference.

This article offers an improved algorithm that based on SLM, which is named Random Screening SLM (RS-SLM). The proposed algorithm executes the selection before the IFFT module. and only selects one sequence with the highest randomness to be transmitted according to the offset. Because only one path of signal is transmitted in IFFT modules, the proposed algorithm has lower complexity compares with SLM.

The experimental results show that this neural network model can well represent the relationship between SEMG signals and elbow joint angles.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASE.2011.5997890","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996073/5997514/05997890.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems Engineering (CASE)","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems Engineering (CASE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASE.2011.5997890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5997514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Prediction of Angle Based on Surface Electromyography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5997890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Prediction of Angle Based on Surface Electromyography","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12208708","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5997890/","conferenceDate":"30-31 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network Prediction of Angle Based on Surface Electromyography","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"pid1098722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034674S","chronDate":"30-31 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996073","isNumber":"5997514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996073","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5997514","articleId":"5997890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5997891,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyuan Zhang","affiliation":["School of electronic and information engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37963292400"},{"name":"Jinlong Yu","affiliation":["School of electronic and information engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jinlong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278397300"},{"name":"Jun Luo","affiliation":["School of electronic and information engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Luo","id":"37404669600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0860-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0859-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0858-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5997891","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase modulation","Optical fiber amplifiers","Chirp","Frequency modulation","Nonlinear optics","Optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chirp modulation","electro-optical modulation","intensity modulation","lithium compounds","optical fibre amplifiers","optical parametric amplifiers","optical pulse compression","optical pulse generation","phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber parametric amplifier pulse source","phase modulation","pump light","short pulse generation","phase modulator","fiber optical parametric amplifier","continuous wave pump light","intensity modulation","electrooptic phase modulator","nonlinear chirp","negative chirp components","light compression","dispersion media","extinction ratio","time 12.7 ps","LiNbO3"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5997891","abstract":"A novel scheme on the improvement in short pulse generation is studied based on phase modulator and fiber optical parametric amplifier (FOPA).

agri-food supply chain network (ASCN) is critical to reduce the sum of production cost and transportation cost. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is presented to handle facility location and production capacity selection as well as choice of transportation mode for ASCN design (ASCND) problem. Due to the complexity of the design problem for the multi-echelon and multi-product ASCN, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is proposed. For binary decision variables, local search within the neighborhood of best solution is embedded into PSO to enhance the exportability. Given binary variables, LINGO is adapted to solve the linear programming problem derived from the MIP. Case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed improved PSO approach. The computational results of case study further show that improved PSO is superior to original binary PSO for ASCND problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICMSS.2011.5998308","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996071/5997898/05998308.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Management and Service Science","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Management and Service Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSS.2011.5998308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5997898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Design of Agri-Food Chain Network: An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5998308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of Agri-Food Chain Network: An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12216667","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5998308/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of Agri-Food Chain Network: An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"02-03-068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060672S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996071","isNumber":"5997898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996071","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5997898","articleId":"5998308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5998658,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Xu","affiliation":["College of Information and Engineering, Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37693123100"},{"name":"Na Hu","affiliation":["College of Information and Engineering, Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Hu","id":"37951483900"},{"name":"Bingxiang Liu","affiliation":["College of Information and Engineering, Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, China"],"firstName":"Bingxiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37065255800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6581-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6579-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6580-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5998658","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Water resources","Particle swarm optimization","Predictive models","Water pollution","Indexes","Radial basis function networks","Rivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ammonia","chlorine","environmental science computing","geophysics computing","hydrological techniques","iron","manganese compounds","neural nets","optimisation","oxygen","pH","phosphorus","radial basis function networks","rivers","sulphur compounds","water pollution","water quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Changjiang","Jingdezhen","China","particle swarm optimization algorithm","water quality trend","water pollution event prevention","water quality prediction model","water quality index","pH","chloride concentration","sulfate concentration","dissolved oxygen concentration","ammonia concentration","permanganate concentration","iron concentration","total phosphorus concentration","radial basis function","RBF neural network model","PSO algorithm","Cl-","SO42-","O","NH3","Fe","P","MnO42-"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5998658","abstract":"In order to obtain the water quality trend of Changjiang of Jingdezhen and prevent water pollution events, a water quality prediction model is built.

However, it is problematic that the geographic distributed resources owned by different institutions with their different price models, usage policies and changing load. The resource providers and resource consumers have different objects, strategies, and requirement. Meanwhile, the availability of resources and the load on them dynamically varies with time. Hence, resource management in Clouds is a complicated task. An economic-based method is presented to allocate Cloud resources, which is based on Pareto optimality theory and realizes the optimal allocation of Cloud resources. And this method can largely avoid a waste of resources and achieve equilibrium between maximizing resource providers' incomes and minimizing consumers' paying. This paper describes a Cloud bank model that depends on market mechanism to understand deeply Pareto optimality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Research of Resource Scheduling Strategy for Cloud Computing Based on Pareto Optimality M\u00d7N Production Model","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Management and Service Science","doi":"10.1109/ICMSS.2011.5998998","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Management and Service Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996071/5997898/05998998.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSS.2011.5998998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5997898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5998998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5998998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Research of Resource Scheduling Strategy for Cloud Computing Based on Pareto Optimality M\u00d7N Production Model","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5998998/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12257568","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Research of Resource Scheduling Strategy for Cloud Computing Based on Pareto Optimality M\u00d7N Production Model","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"05-01-034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099021S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996071","isNumber":"5997898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996071","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5997898","articleId":"5998998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5999115,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Faro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Faro","id":"37294802100"},{"name":"Daniela Giordano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Giordano","id":"37356118000"},{"name":"Concetto Spampinato","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Concetto","lastName":"Spampinato","id":"37547440100"},{"name":"Rosalia Leonardi","affiliation":["Department of Orthodontics, Policlinico Gaspare Rodolico, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Rosalia","lastName":"Leonardi","id":"37431017800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1190-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1189-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1188-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-7125"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-7125"}],"articleNumber":"5999115","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999115","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical education","bone","computer aided instruction","medical image processing","radiology","X-ray imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skeletal bone age","radiology","en-docrinological problems","X-ray images","computer-based system","medical imaging resource center","digital educational resources","learning tool"]}],"abstract":"The assessment of skeletal bone age is an important step both in diagnostic and in therapeutic investigations of en-docrinological problems and growth disorders of children. Currently, there are two main approaches for skeletal bone age estimation that use X-Ray images: 1) the Greulich and Pyle (G&P) method and 2) the Tanner and Whitehouse (TW2 or TW3) methods. Although the G&P method is the most widely used for its simplicity, the TW2/TW3 method is the most accurate one, but it requires intensive training, especially for novice radiologists. The method is complex since it involves the simultaneous assessment of shapes and relative distances among several bones of the hand and with the further complication of the interaction between sex, age and race. In this paper we propose a computer-based system for assisting radiologists in the training with the Tan-ner&Whitehouse method; the system is based on an engine for automated assessment of skeletal bone age from X-Rays. In detail, after evaluating the user level, the system automatically proposes personalized training sessions by drawing from a wide repository of hand X-rays, and it suggests remedial sessions upon identification the features of the cases where the users demonstrated misconceptions. Finally, all the X-Rays that show combinations of features provenly difficult, are treated as teaching cases and are converted into Medical Imaging Resource Center (MIRC) format to ease their integration into more comprehensive digital educational resources.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS.2011.5999115","publicationTitle":"2011 24th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 24th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983498/5999016/05999115.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/CBMS.2011.5999115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A learning tool for assessing skeletal bone age in radiology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A learning tool for assessing skeletal bone age in radiology","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5999115/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12208303","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999115/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A learning tool for assessing skeletal bone age in radiology","confLoc":"Bristol, UK","sourcePdf":"cbms2011track04paper034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055148S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983498","isNumber":"5999016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983498","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5999016","articleId":"5999115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5999143,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Although a significant amount of research has been done on behavioral modalities, less explored characteristics include the physiological signals. This work brings to the table the ECG signal and presents a thorough analysis of its psychological properties. The fact that this signal has been established as a biometric characteristic calls for subject-dependent emotion recognizers that capture the instantaneous variability of the signal from its homeostatic baseline. A solution based on the empirical mode decomposition is proposed for the detection of dynamically evolving emotion patterns on ECG. Classification features are based on the instantaneous frequency (Hilbert-Huang transform) and the local oscillation within every mode. Two experimental setups are presented for the elicitation of active arousal and passive arousal/valence. The results support the expectations for subject specificity, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of determining valence out of the ECG morphology (up to 89 percent for 44 subjects). In addition, this work differentiates for the first time between active and passive arousal, and advocates that there are higher chances of ECG reactivity to emotion when the induction method is active for the subject.","doi":"10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.28","startPage":"102","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165369/6179756/05999653.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG Pattern Analysis for Emotion Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"ECG Pattern Analysis for Emotion Detection","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12653737","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5999653/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG Pattern Analysis for Emotion Detection","sourcePdf":"tta2012010102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177618S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"6179756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"6179756","articleId":"5999653","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5999657,"authors":[{"name":"Farrokh Ghani Zadegan","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6280556/5999657/5999657-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farrokh Ghani Zadegan received the BS degree in electrical engineering from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, in 2001, and the MS degree in electrical engineering from Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden, in 2010.

This paper presents algorithms to compute the overall access time (OAT) for a given P1687 network. The algorithms are based on analysis for flat and hierarchical network architectures, considering two access schedules, i.e., concurrent schedule and sequential schedule. In the analysis, two types of overhead are identified, i.e., network configuration data overhead and JTAG protocol overhead. The algorithms are implemented and employed in a parametric analysis and in experiments on realistic industrial designs.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6280556/05999657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280556","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access Time Analysis for IEEE P1687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Access Time Analysis for IEEE P1687","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999657/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12968472","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5999657/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access Time Analysis for IEEE P1687","sourcePdf":"ttc2012101459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091605S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6280556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6280556","articleId":"5999657","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5999658,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Hanumaiah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6280556/5999658/5999658-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vinay Hanumaiah (S'08-S'12) received the BEng degree in electronics and communication engineering from M.S.

The first is the computation of the optimal time-varying voltages and speeds of each core in a heterogeneous multicore processor, that minimize the makespan-the latest completion time of all tasks, while satisfying timing and temperature constraints. The solution to the makespan minimization problem is then extended to the problem of determining the feasible speeds and voltages that satisfy task deadlines. The methods presented in this paper also provide a theoretical basis and analytical relations between speed, voltage, power and temperature, which provide greater insight into the early-phase design of processors and are also useful for online dynamic thermal management.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6280556/05999658.pdf","startPage":"1484","endPage":"1494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature-Aware DVFS for Hard Real-Time Applications on Multicore Processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999658/","displayDocTitle":"Temperature-Aware DVFS for Hard Real-Time Applications on Multicore Processors","volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12977962","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999658/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature-Aware DVFS for Hard Real-Time Applications on Multicore Processors","sourcePdf":"ttc2012101484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086979S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6280556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6280556","articleId":"5999658","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5999661,"authors":[{"name":"Kassian Plankensteiner","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6176150/5999661/5999661-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kassian Plankensteiner received the Bakktechn and Dipl-Ing degrees from the University of Innsbruck, Austria, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Understanding how these evolve over time poses a challenge for existing visualization techniques originally developed for fixed network structures. We describe a method of incorporating the concept of aging into evolving networks, where nodes and edges store information related to the amount of local evolutionary change they have experienced. This property is used to generate visualizations that ensure stable substructures maintain relatively fixed spatial positions, allowing them to act as visual markers and providing context for evolutionary change elsewhere. By further supplementing these visualizations with color cues, the resultant animations enable a clearer portrayal of the underlying evolutionary process.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6214949/05999664.pdf","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6214949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Aging to Visually Uncover Evolutionary Processes on Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999664/","displayDocTitle":"Using Aging to Visually Uncover Evolutionary Processes on Networks","volume":"18","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12786231","pubMedId":"21860063","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999664/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Aging to Visually Uncover Evolutionary Processes on Networks","sourcePdf":"ttg2012081343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066186S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6214949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6214949","articleId":"5999664","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5999666,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Ju Yu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ya-Ju","lastName":"Yu","id":"37405460300"},{"name":"Pi-Cheng Hsiu","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation (CITI), Institute of Information Science (IIS), Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pi-Cheng","lastName":"Hsiu","id":"37545452000"},{"name":"Ai-Chun Pang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ai-Chun","lastName":"Pang","id":"37267352100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"5999666","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1591},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Resource management","Energy consumption","Streaming media","Approximation algorithms","Static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","computational complexity","resource allocation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient video multicast","4G wireless systems","layer-based video coding","adaptive modulation","adaptive coding","real-time video multicast services","heterogeneous mobile devices","data communications","energy consumption","resource allocation","fourth-generation wireless systems","data reception","scalable video coding","NP-hard problem","2-approximation algorithm","multiple description coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","video multicast","scalable video coding","multiple description coding","adaptive modulation and coding","4G wireless systems."]}],"abstract":"Layer-based video coding, together with adaptive modulation and coding, is a promising technique for providing real-time video multicast services on heterogeneous mobile devices. With the rapid growth of data communications for emerging applications, reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices is a major challenge. This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation for video multicast in fourth-generation wireless systems, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption for data reception. First, we consider the problem when scalable video coding is applied. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and propose a 2-approximation algorithm to solve it. Then, we investigate the problem under multiple description coding, and show that it is also NP-hard and cannot be approximated in polynomial time with a ratio better than 2, unless P = NP. To solve this case, we develop a pseudopolynomial time 2-approximation algorithm. The results of simulations conducted to compare the proposed algorithms with a brute-force optimal algorithm and a conventional approach are very encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6269879/05999666.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269879","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Video Multicast in 4G Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Video Multicast in 4G Wireless Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999666/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933214","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Video Multicast in 4G Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"ttm2012101508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041983S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","isNumber":"6269879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"41","articleId":"5999666","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5999667,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Pu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406354800"},{"name":"Ian F.

It is shown that DSA induces only light-tailed delay if both the busy time of PU channels and the message size of SUs are light tailed. On the contrary, if either the busy time or the message size is heavy tailed, then the SUs' transmission delay is heavy tailed. For this latter case, it is proven that if one of either the busy time or the message size is light tailed and the other is regularly varying with index \u03b1, the transmission delay is regularly varying with the same index. As a consequence, the delay has an infinite mean provided \u03b1 <; 1 and an infinite variance provided \u03b1 <; 2. Furthermore, if both the busy time and the message size are regularly varying with different indices, then the delay tail distribution is as heavy as the one with the smaller index. Moreover, the impact of spectrum mobility and multiradio diversity on the delay performance of SUs is studied. It is shown that both spectrum mobility and multiradio diversity can greatly mitigate the heavy-tailed delay by increasing the orders of its finite moments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Origins of Heavy-Tailed Delay in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.187","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6111374/05999667.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Origins of Heavy-Tailed Delay in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5999667/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425821","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Origins of Heavy-Tailed Delay in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2012020204.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033661S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","isNumber":"6111374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"16","articleId":"5999667","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5999695,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Such a problem exists when a high-resolution image or video is to be displayed on low-resolution display terminals. Limited by the low-resolution display, we have to shrink the image. Signal-processing theory tells us that optimal decimation requires low-pass filtering with a suitable cutoff frequency, followed by downsampling. In doing so, we need to remove many useful image details causing blurring. Subpixel-based downsampling, taking advantage of the fact that each pixel on a color LCD is actually composed of individual red, green, and blue subpixel stripes, can provide apparent higher resolution. In this paper, we use frequency-domain analysis to explain what happens in subpixel-based downsampling and why it is possible to achieve a higher apparent resolution. According to our frequency-domain analysis and observation, the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter for subpixel-based decimation can be effectively extended beyond the Nyquist frequency using a novel antialiasing filter. Applying the proposed filters to two existing subpixel downsampling schemes called direct subpixel-based downsampling (DSD) and diagonal DSD (DDSD), we obtain two improved schemes, i.e., DSD based on frequency-domain analysis (DSD-FA) and DDSD based on frequency-domain analysis (DDSD-FA). Experimental results verify that the proposed DSD-FA and DDSD-FA can provide superior results, compared with existing subpixel or pixel-based downsampling methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Image resolution","Image color analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Image edge detection","Color","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antialiasing","filtering theory","liquid crystal displays","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antialiasing filter design","subpixel downsampling","frequency domain analysis","image downsampling","liquid crystal displays","high resolution image","low resolution display terminals","signal processing theory","low pass filtering","direct subpixel based downsampling","diagonal DSD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downsampling","frequency analysis","subpixel rendering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2165550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6151934/05999717.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2165550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antialiasing Filter Design for Subpixel Downsampling via Frequency-Domain Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antialiasing Filter Design for Subpixel Downsampling via Frequency-Domain Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999717/","volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999717/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12537595","pubMedId":"21878415","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antialiasing Filter Design for Subpixel Downsampling via Frequency-Domain Analysis","sourcePdf":"tip-fang-2165550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109956S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"5999717","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5999718,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv Soundararajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6129825/5999718/5999718-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajiv Soundararajan (M'08) received the B.E. degree (honors) in electrical and electronics engineering in 2006 from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2008 from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests are broadly in statistical image and video processing, information theory and, more specifically, in compression and quality assessment."]},"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Soundararajan","id":"37392276500"},{"name":"Alan C.

Algorithms that measure differences between the entropies of wavelet coefficients of reference and distorted images, as perceived by humans, are designed. The algorithms differ in the data on which the entropy difference is calculated and on the amount of information from the reference that is required for quality computation, ranging from almost full information to almost no information from the reference. A special case of these is algorithms that require just a single number from the reference for QA. The algorithms are shown to correlate very well with subjective quality scores, as demonstrated on the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering Image Quality Assessment Database and the Tampere Image Database.

Two embedded internal permanent magnets and a large external magnet are used to actuate the robot remotely. The proposed MASCE has three novel features. First, its outside body is made of soft elastomer-based compliant structures. Such compliant structures can deform passively during the robot-tissue contact interactions, which makes the device safer and less invasive. Next, it can be actively deformed in the axial direction by using external magnetic actuation, which provides an extra degree of freedom that enables various advanced functions such as axial position control, drug releasing, drug injection, or biopsy. Finally, it navigates in three dimensions by rolling on the stomach surface as a new surface locomotion method inside the stomach. Here, the external attractive magnetic force is used to anchor the robot on a desired location, and the external magnetic torque is used to roll it to another location, which provides a stable, continuous, and controllable motion. The paper presents design and fabrication methods for the compliant structures of the robot with its axial deformation and position control capability. Rolling-based surface locomotion of the robot using external magnetic torques is modeled, and its feasibility is tested and verified on a synthetic stomach surface by using a magnetically actuated capsule endoscope prototype.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","volume":"28","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"12524323","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999728/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Rolling Locomotion of a Magnetically Actuated Soft Capsule Endoscope","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Rolling Locomotion of a Magnetically Actuated Soft Capsule Endoscope","sourcePdf":"tro-sitti-2163861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094102S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6145195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"6145195","articleId":"5999728","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5999729,"authors":[{"name":"Seong-woo Ahn","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-woo","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37876214800"},{"name":"Hano Wang","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hano","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405989900"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5999729","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":637},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","OFDM","Fading channels","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency diversity","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","energy conservation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput-delay tradeoff","proportional fair scheduling","OFDMA systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","user multiplexing","2-D resource partitioning","resource allocation","frequency-domain partitioning","degree of multiplexing","degree of frequency diversity","DoM","quality-of-service","energy efficiency analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","proportional fair (PF)","quality of service (QoS)"]}],"abstract":"This work presents an analytical model of the throughput-delay tradeoff found in proportional fair scheduling used in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems in the context of user multiplexing. For this purpose, we propose a simple and efficient resource allocation scheme based on 2-D resource partitioning in the frequency and time domains. Basically, frequency-domain partitioning is determined by the degree of frequency diversity, and time-domain partitioning determines the degree of multiplexing (DoM), which is the number of users to be served in a subchannel of a frame. We investigate the effect of the DoM and frequency diversity on the delay quality-of-service (QoS) performance of OFDMA systems by analyzing the effective capacity. In addition, an energy efficiency analysis in the wideband regime shows that insufficient frequency diversity increases the impact of the delay QoS constraint on energy efficiency, and in this case, greater energy efficiency can be achieved by using an appropriate DoM.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2166125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/05999729.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2166125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","startPage":"4620","endPage":"4626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput\u2013Delay Tradeoff of Proportional Fair Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Throughput\u2013Delay Tradeoff of Proportional Fair Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408144","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5999729/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput\u2013Delay Tradeoff of Proportional Fair Scheduling in OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-hong-2166125-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092247S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"5999729","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5999731,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Ma","affiliation":["Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6045674/5999731/5999731-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi Ma received the B.S. degree in computer science from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY.","He is currently with Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, working on large-scale search infrastructure design and development.

A key challenge in such networks is to achieve maximum lifetime for battery-powered mobile devices with dynamic energy-efficient algorithms. Recent studies in battery technology have revealed that the behavior of battery discharging is more complex than we used to know. Battery-powered devices might waste a huge amount of energy if their battery discharging is not carefully scheduled and budgeted. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy model for batteries and study the effect of battery behavior on routing in wireless ad hoc networks. We first propose an online computable discrete-time mathematical model to capture battery discharging behavior. The model has low computational complexity and data storage requirement. It is therefore suitable for online battery capacity computation in routing. Our evaluations indicate that the model can accurately capture the behavior of battery discharging. Based on this battery model, we then propose a battery-aware routing (BAR) scheme for wireless ad hoc networks. BAR is a generic scheme that implements battery awareness in routing protocols and is independent of any specific routing protocol. By dynamically choosing the devices with well-recovered batteries as routers and leaving the \u201cfatigue\u201d batteries for recovery, the BAR scheme can effectively recover the device's battery capacity to achieve higher energy efficiency. Our simulation results demonstrate that, by adopting the BAR scheme, network lifetime and data throughput can be increased by up to 28% and 24%, respectively. The results also show that BAR achieves good performance in various networks composed of different devices, batteries, and node densities. Finally, we also propose an enhanced prioritized BAR (PBAR) scheme for time-sensitive applications in wireless ad hoc networks. Our simulation results illustrate that PBAR achieves good performance in terms of end-to-end delay and data throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/05999731.pdf","startPage":"3919","endPage":"3932","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2166093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2166093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Battery-Aware Scheme for Routing in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Computational modeling","Routing","Mathematical model","Mobile ad hoc networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","mathematical analysis","mobile ad hoc networks","routing protocols","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery-aware scheme","wireless ad hoc networks","battery-powered mobile devices","dynamic energy-efficient algorithms","battery discharging","battery-powered devices","online computable discrete-time mathematical model","computational complexity","data storage","online battery capacity computation","battery-aware routing scheme","generic scheme","battery awareness","routing protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery models","battery-aware routing (BAR) schemes","battery awareness","energy efficiency","prioritized routing","routing protocols","wireless ad hoc networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Battery-Aware Scheme for Routing in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5999731/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291117","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Battery-Aware Scheme for Routing in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2166093-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099026S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5999731","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5999732,"authors":[{"name":"Xinping Yi","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"bio":{"p":["Xinping Yi photograph and biography not available at the time ofpublication."]},"firstName":"Xinping","lastName":"Yi","id":"38469274000"},{"name":"Edward K.

However, many existing user-scheduling algorithms are designed with an implicit assumption that users are homogeneous. In this paper, we revisit the problem by exploring the characteristics of heterogeneous users from a subspace viewpoint. With an objective of minimizing interference nonorthogonality among users, three new angular-based user-scheduling criteria are proposed. While the first criterion is heuristically determined by identifying the incapability of the largest principal angle to characterize subspace correlation and, hence, interference nonorthogonality between users, the second and third criteria are derived by using the sum rate capacity bounds with block diagonalization and the change in capacity by adding a new user into an existing user subset, respectively. Aiming to capture fairness among heterogeneous users while maintaining multiuser diversity gain, two new hybrid user-scheduling algorithms, whose computational complexities are only linearly proportional to the number of users, are proposed. We show by simulations the effectiveness of our proposed user-scheduling criteria and algorithms with respect to those commonly used in a homogeneous environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Scheduling for Heterogeneous Multiuser MIMO Systems: A Subspace Viewpoint","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2165976","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/05999732.pdf","startPage":"4004","endPage":"4013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2165976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"User Scheduling for Heterogeneous Multiuser MIMO Systems: A Subspace Viewpoint","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5999732/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291118","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Scheduling for Heterogeneous Multiuser MIMO Systems: A Subspace Viewpoint","sourcePdf":"tvt-yi-2165976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172687S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"5999732","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5999734,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Liu","affiliation":["Texas Analog Center of Excellence (TxACE), University of Texas, Dallas, TX, USA","Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6056707/5999734/5999734-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenbo Liu (S'08\u2013M'11) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2004.

Securing the wireless communication requires the shared secret keys between the communicating entities. Traditional security schemes rely on public key infrastructures and cryptographic algorithms to manage secret keys. Recently, many physical-layer-based methods have been proposed as alternative solutions for key generation in wireless networks. These methods exploit the inherent randomness of the wireless fading channel to generate secret keys while providing information-theoretical security without intensive cryptographic computations. This article provides an overview of the existing PHY-based key generation schemes exploiting the randomness of the wireless channels. Specifically, we first introduce the fundamental and general framework of the PHY-based key generation schemes and then categorize them into two classes: received-signal-strength-based and channel- phase-based protocols. Finally, we present a performance comparison of them in terms of key disagreement probability, key generation rate, key bit randomness, scalability, and implementation issues.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.5999759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.5999759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5999755/05999759.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret key generation exploiting channel characteristics in wireless communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Secret key generation exploiting channel characteristics in wireless communications","volume":"18","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999759/","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206658","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999759/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret key generation exploiting channel characteristics in wireless communications","sourcePdf":"005REN LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05003S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5999755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"5999755","articleId":"5999759","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5999761,"authors":[{"name":"Chittabrata Ghosh","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Chittabrata Ghosh [m] (ghoshc@u.washington.edu) is currently a postdoctoral research associate in electrical engineering, University of Washington, Seattle.

Thus, new services may opportunistically use temporarily unoccupied TV channels, known as television white space. This has motivated several standardization efforts such as IEEE 802.22, 802.11af, 802.19 TG1, and ECMA 392 to further cognitive networking. Specifically, multiple collocated secondary networks are expected to use TVWS, each with distinct requirements (bandwidth, transmission power, different system architectures, and device types) that must all comply with regulatory requirements to protect incumbents. Heterogeneous coexistence in the TVWS is thus expected to be an important research challenge. This article introduces the current regulatory scenario, emerging standards for cognitive wireless networks targeting the TVWS, and discusses possible coexistence scenarios and associated challenges. Furthermore, the article casts an eye on future considerations for these upcoming standards in support of spectrum sharing opportunities as a function of network architecture evolution.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.5999761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5999755/05999761.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.5999761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistence challenges for heterogeneous cognitive wireless networks in TV white spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999761/","displayDocTitle":"Coexistence challenges for heterogeneous cognitive wireless networks in TV white spaces","volume":"18","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12213643","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999761/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coexistence challenges for heterogeneous cognitive wireless networks in TV white spaces","sourcePdf":"007CAVALCANTI LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062719S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5999755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5999755","articleId":"5999761","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5999763,"authors":[{"name":"Satish C.

However, many technical issues still need to be addressed for successful deployment of CR networks, especially in the MAC layer. We focus on CR networks that have distributed architecture because they offer ease of deployment, self-organizing capability, and flexibility in design, and are believed to be more practical for future deployments compared to their centralized counterparts. The MAC protocols for distributed CR networks should consider the key features of these networks such as lack of a central unit to coordinate the communication, dynamic topology, requirements to keep interference to primary users minimal, and variation of spectrum availability with time and location. To clarify the relevant research challenges and issues, we provide a detailed study of the critical design issues and an overview of current state-of-the-art MAC protocols proposed for DCRNs. A classification of existing proposals is provided, and their salient features, advantages, and limitations are discussed. We then introduce and study a novel MAC protocol that addresses some of the research issues better than existing solutions. We also highlight important research challenges that could drive future research in this area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","volume":"18","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"12206660","publicationDate":"August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999763/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Medium access control in distributed cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium access control in distributed cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"009JHA LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053632S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5999755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5999755","articleId":"5999763","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5999764,"authors":[{"name":"Tadeusz Wysocki","affiliation":["University of Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Tadeusz Wysocki [s09] (tad@ee.usyd.edu.au) is currently completing a Ph.D. at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney.

Recently, PT has been applied as a spectrum management tool for cognitive radio for QoS management in CR and the pricing of CR access rights. PT is characterized by the analysis of risk and return, concepts that feature widely in wireless communications due to the random nature of traffic and radio channels. Compared with traditional CR resource management techniques (e.g., game theory), where the aim has been the maximization of QoS or another utility measure, the key advantage of PTbased resource management stems from the focus on both the mean utility achieved by a communication system, as well as utility variance. Ignoring QoS (e.g., throughput) variance in communication system design may lead to systems that are unusable by some applications, even though mean QoS remains high. In applications such as pricing-based spectrum management, PT analysis incorporates the variance of investment returns, a key measure of economic welfare, into pricing and trading strategies. In this article we examine the key concepts behind PT, risk and return, as well as their importance in CR and wireless communications. As examples, we analyze the application of PT in solving CR spectrum management problems through QoS management and pricing of spectrum access rights.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.5999764","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5999755/05999764.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.5999764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","startPage":"52","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum management in cognitive radio: Applications of portfolio theory in wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum management in cognitive radio: Applications of portfolio theory in wireless communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999764/","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5999764/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12213644","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum management in cognitive radio: Applications of portfolio theory in wireless communications","sourcePdf":"010WYSOCKI LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135144S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5999755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5999755","articleId":"5999764","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5999809,"authors":[{"name":"Maja Etinski","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Etinski","id":"37393277400"},{"name":"Julita Corbalan","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Julita","lastName":"Corbalan","id":"37282721200"},{"name":"Jesus Labarta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"Labarta","id":"37283852600"},{"name":"Mateo Valero","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Mateo","lastName":"Valero","id":"37265842600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-383-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5999809","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"abstract":"Power has become the primary constraint in high performance computing. Traditionally, parallel job scheduling policies have been designed to improve certain job performance metrics when scheduling parallel workloads on a system with a given number of processors. The available number of processors is not anymore the only limitation in parallel job scheduling. The recent increase in processor power consumption has resulted in a new limitation: the available power. Given constraints naturally lead to an optimization problem. In this paper we propose MaxJobPerf, a new parallel job scheduling policy based on integer linear programming. Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a widely used technique that running applications at reduced CPU frequency/voltage trades increased execution time for power reduction. The optimization problem determines which jobs should run and at which frequency. The MaxJobPerf policy clearly outperforms the other power budgeting approaches at the parallel job scheduling level.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979720/5999789/05999809.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear programming based parallel job scheduling for power constrained systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Power demand","Time frequency analysis","Runtime","Processor scheduling","Optimization","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","parallel processing","power aware computing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel job scheduling","power constrained system","high performance computing","job performance metrics","parallel workload scheduling","processor power consumption","optimization problem","MaxJobPerf","integer linear programming","dynamic voltage frequency scaling","power budgeting approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power budget","CPU power consumption","parallel job scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Linear programming based parallel job scheduling for power constrained systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999809/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12327962","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear programming based parallel job scheduling for power constrained systems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086888S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979720","isNumber":"5999789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979720","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5999789","articleId":"5999809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5999839,"authors":[{"name":"Ralf Jahr","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Augsburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Jahr","id":"37546728100"},{"name":"Theo Ungerer","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Augsburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Theo","lastName":"Ungerer","id":"37278779900"},{"name":"Horia Calborean","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, Romania"],"firstName":"Horia","lastName":"Calborean","id":"37546110100"},{"name":"Lucian Vintan","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian","lastName":"Vintan","id":"37370581500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-383-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5999839","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Arrays","Hardware","Optimization","Registers","Space exploration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic multiobjective optimization","hardware optimization","code optimization","computer architectures","system simulators","optimal configuration","multiobjective design space exploration tool","FADSE","Grid Alu Processor","GAPtimize","parallel processing","hardware complexity","program optimization","Pareto frontier","near-optimal individual"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic design space exploration","Multiobjective optimization","Hardware complexity estimation","Code optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999839","abstract":"Recent computer architectures can be configured in lots of different ways.

In this article we use a multi-objective design space exploration tool called FADSE to explore the vast design space of the Grid Alu Processor (GAP) and its post-link optimizer called GAPtimize. We improved FADSE with techniques to make it more robust against failures and to speed up evaluations through parallel processing. For the GAP, we present an approximation of the hardware complexity as second objective besides execution time. Mining of functions applied as a whole program optimization with GAPtimize is used as example for a code optimization. We show that FADSE is able to thoroughly explore the design space for both GAP and GAPtimize and it can find an ap proximation of the Pareto frontier consisting of near-optimal individuals in moderate time.","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999839","startPage":"308","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999789","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979720/5999789/05999839.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic multi-objective optimization of parameters for hardware and code optimizations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999839/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic multi-objective optimization of parameters for hardware and code optimizations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999839/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12327989","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic multi-objective optimization of parameters for hardware and code optimizations","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100832S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979720","isNumber":"5999789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979720","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5999789","articleId":"5999839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5999845,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The challenge is how the original signal could be recovered from a few linear observations. Recently, many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed which mostly rely on computationally costly batch-based estimation which lacks the ability of estimating changes in the signal to be reconstructed. In this paper, a recursive reconstruction algorithm is proposed which has the ability of sequentially utilizing the received observations and so capable of tracking the time varying underlying sparse or compressible signals, while, Due to the adaptive structure, the computational cost is spread out in time iterations. Simulation tests compare the performance of the proposed and state of the art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999845","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979720/5999789/05999845.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sparsity-aware parameter vector reconstruction with application to compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999845/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sparsity-aware parameter vector reconstruction with application to compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12327995","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999845/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sparsity-aware parameter vector reconstruction with application to compressed sensing","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087772S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979720","isNumber":"5999789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979720","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5999789","articleId":"5999845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5999847,"authors":[{"name":"Asadollah Shahbahrami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Asadollah","lastName":"Shahbahrami","id":"37398211900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-383-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-382-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5999847","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Finite impulse response filter","Filtering algorithms","Buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D discrete wavelet transform","data-level parallelism","JPEG2000 standard","2D discrete cosine transform","SIMD-enhanced architecture","row-column wavelet transform","line-based wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Wavelet Transform","Multimedia Extensions","SIMD"]}],"abstract":"The JPEG2000 standard uses the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D DWT), while the JPEG standard uses the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

One way to improve the performance of the 2D DWT is using parallel techniques on an SIMD-enhanced architecture. In this paper, we apply data-level parallelism technique to exploit available parallelism of the 2D DWT. We focus on the two algorithms to traverse an image to implement the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), namely Row-Column Wavelet Transform (RCWT) and line-Based Wavelet Transform (IBWT).

They form multi-hop and self organized networks, making energy consumption a crucial design issue. Research has shown that clustering sensor nodes is an efficient method to manage energy consumption for prolonging the network lifetime, but most of routing protocols focus on homogeneous sensor networks and they are not optimized for the characteristics of heterogeneous networks, in which a percentage of the sensor nodes is equipped with additional energy capacities. In this paper we evaluate the performance of a new scalable architecture HARP, Hierarchical Adaptive and Reliable Routing Protocol, in a heterogeneous scenario. HARP provides efficient link fault tolerance and also supports node mobility management. Furthermore, a new cluster head election formulation protocol (s-HARP) has been adapted to heterogeneous networks. Our performance evaluation has shown that HARP and s HARP can significantly reduce the energy consumption and prolong the useful lifetime of the network outperforming some popular existing clustering protocols.","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999859","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979720/5999789/05999859.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999789","startPage":"449","endPage":"455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low energy and adaptive routing architecture for efficient field monitoring in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low energy and adaptive routing architecture for efficient field monitoring in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999859/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12338450","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5999859/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low energy and adaptive routing architecture for efficient field monitoring in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081115S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979720","isNumber":"5999789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979720","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5999789","articleId":"5999859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5999863,"authors":[{"name":"Cesar O.

The programming problem is even more complex in the case of systems that utilize reconfigurable devices. The increased complexity of programming necessitates the use of tools that can support programmers in migrating existing applications to these emerging systems. Programmers need increasingly sophisticated tools for profiling and analysis of applications. Particularly, tools to inspect the memory access behavior of applications become crucial due to the processor/memory communication bottleneck. In this paper, we present xQUAD, a unique extension to the QUAD dynamic profiling toolset, which augments the memory access analysis of an application by providing detailed, fine-grained intra-function information. xQUAD provides detailed memory access information on the application source code data object granularity. This information can help programmers for application optimization and revision. We also present a ranking method based on the memory access intensity of a function, which reveals more accurately the suitability of the function for hardware implementation. xQUAD is tested on a real application from the multimedia domain to describe the capabilities of the proposed toolset.","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999888","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5979720/5999789/05999888.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5999789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime extraction of memory access information from the application source code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5999888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5999888/","displayDocTitle":"Runtime extraction of memory access information from the application source code","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12338477","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5999888/","conferenceDate":"4-8 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime extraction of memory access information from the application source code","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082326S","chronDate":"4-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5979720","isNumber":"5999789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5979720","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5999789","articleId":"5999888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"}]
