Neural network has characteristics, such as automatically organizing, automatically studying and memory capability etc; therefore, after training the network by a number of examples, the measurement can be implemented. 4 flat-grinding specimens with different roughness values are measured in the experiments.

The thermal overheating and cycling degrades the integrity of the materials used for stator winding insulation, resulting in acceleration of thermal aging. A new approach for induction motor temperature monitoring based on wavelet transform and neural network is presented. The wavelet transform is a well-suited tool for analyzing high-frequency transients in the presence of low-frequency components. The wavelet network has been successfully applied to nonlinear static function approximation and classification, and dynamical system modeling. The stator and rotor resistance are identified on-line, and then the temperature is calculated according to the principle that the metal resistance depends on its temperature. The evolutionary algorithm is used to fulfill the network parameter identification, reducing the size of the training set by selecting the most relevant features. The simulation results approve that the proposed method is effective for temperature condition monitoring of induction motor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5244860/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11233132","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5244860/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The performance improvement of condition monitoring for induction motor based on neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance improvement of condition monitoring for induction motor based on neural network","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA09718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052932S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226790","isNumber":"5244759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226790","xplore-issue":"5244759","articleId":"5244860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5244870,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Shanlin","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Kang Shanlin","id":"37087540947"},{"name":"Zhuang Huanzhen","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Zhuang Huanzhen","id":"37087810799"},{"name":"Kang Yuzhe","affiliation":["Diagnosis and Self-Recovery Engineering Research Center, Beijing University of Chemical and Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Kang Yuzhe","id":"37087538436"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2692-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2693-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"5244870","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5244870","abstract":"In the conventional direct torque control system, both of the torque and stator flux errors between reference and estimated values are directly compared, and the appropriate voltage vector is produced by a switching table. On basis of quick torque response and robustness against parameter variation, the direct torque control system has been widely used in the industrial production. To improve its dynamic performance, a novel approach using wavelet network is introduced. The wavelet function is adopted as the basic function of neural network taking advantage of wavelet transform behaving good localization property in both time and frequency space and multi-scale property. The wavelet transform can accurately detect and localize signal characteristic in time-frequency domains. By means of improved training algorithm, the parameters of wavelet network are adjusted offline to minimize the approximation error. The simulation results prove that the proposed method can efficiently reduce the torque ripple and current ripple, optimizing system control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2009.5244870","startPage":"3966","endPage":"3970","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226790/5244759/05244870.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2009.5244870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5244759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel control method for dynamic performance improvement of induction motor using neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Neural networks","Torque control","Wavelet transforms","Stators","Error correction","Robust control","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control","Production systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","induction motors","minimisation","neural nets","torque control","voltage control","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic performance improvement","induction motor","neural network","direct torque control system","stator flux","voltage vector","switching table","parameter variation","wavelet transform","approximation error minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Induction motor","torque and flux","neural network","dynamic performance","signal characteristic","approximation error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5244870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel control method for dynamic performance improvement of induction motor using neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5244870/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11239068","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel control method for dynamic performance improvement of induction motor using neural network","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA09715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056922S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226790","isNumber":"5244759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226790","xplore-issue":"5244759","articleId":"5244870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5244937,"authors":[{"name":"Hongping Wang","affiliation":["School of Electromechanical Engineer, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Hongping Wang","id":"37087420877"},{"name":"Guohua Cao","affiliation":["School of Electromechanical Engineer, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Guohua Cao","id":"37087420942"},{"name":"Hongji Xu","affiliation":["School of Electromechanical Engineer, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Hongji Xu","id":"37087074203"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Changchun University of Science and Technology, No. 7089 WeiXing Road Jilin Province, China"],"lastName":"Peng Wang","id":"37087220311"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2692-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2693-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"5244937","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear distortion","Cameras","Lenses","Information geometry","Data mining","Least squares methods","Distortion measurement","Gain measurement","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feature extraction","least squares approximations","neural nets","nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion correction","standard grid","image interpretation","geometry distortion","image extraction","least square procedure","measured data","distortion data","grid plate centre","BP neural network","backpropagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","grid image","geometry distortion","correction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5244937","abstract":"Image interpretation must obtain accurate position of image, but those questions, brought by angle of imaging equipment placed and camera lens deviation, induce nonlinear geometry distortion of image.

However, the performance of adaptive beamforming techniques may degrade severely in the presence of mismatches between the assumed array response and the true array response. Similar types of degradation can occur when the signal array response is known exactly, but the training sample size is small. In this paper, we propose a novel robust adaptive beamforming algorithm, which is based on explicit modeling of uncertainties in the desired signal array response and data covariance matrix. The proposed algorithm belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches, but the diagonal loading term can be precisely calculated, which is incorporated at each step. To decrease computation complexity, the weight vector based on the variable diagonal loading is obtained by Taylor series. The proposed algorithm has nearly optimal performance under good conditions, provides the robustness against the signal steering vector mismatches and the small training sample size, and makes the mean output array SINR consistently close to the optimal one. Simulation results validate substantial performance improvements relative to other adaptive beamforming methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5246032/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11146417","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5246032/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming algorithm under nonlinear constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamforming algorithm under nonlinear constraint","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA09542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05883S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226790","isNumber":"5244759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226790","xplore-issue":"5244759","articleId":"5246032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5246047,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, College of Information Engineering, Shenyang Institute of Chemical Technology, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Ying Jiang","id":"37087192251"},{"name":"Shuoyu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Mechanical Systems Engineering, Kochi University of Technology, Kochi, Japan"],"lastName":"Shuoyu Wang","id":"37087161458"},{"name":"Baodong Bai","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Baodong Bai","id":"37087275507"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2692-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2693-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"5246047","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Rehabilitation robotics","Legged locomotion","Chemical technology","Motion control","Kinematics","Robotics and automation","Mobile robots","Testing","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geriatrics","handicapped aids","mobile robots","motion control","neurocontrollers","patient rehabilitation","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based robust control strategy","omnidirectional lower limbs rehabilitation robot","centre-of-gravity position","motion control","mobile rehabilitation robot","tracking control","centre-of-gravity shift","elderly persons"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Omnidirectional Lower Limbs Rehabilitation Robot","Centre-of-gravity Shift","Motion Control","Robust Control","NN(Neural Network)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5246047","abstract":"Motion control of mobile rehabilitation robot during centre-of-gravity shift is an intrinsic problem with mechanism.

A numerical example is given demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246284","startPage":"860","endPage":"865","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226790/5244759/05246284.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5244759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relaxed exponential stability condition for a class of uncertain time-delay neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Robust stability","Linear matrix inequalities","Uncertainty","Stability analysis","Delay effects","Neurons","Mechatronics","Automation","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertain time-delay neural networks","relaxed robust exponential stability","distributed delays","polytopic form","parameter-dependent Lypaunov-Krasovskii functionals","free weighting matrices","relaxed linear matrix inequalities","LMI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks","polytopic uncertainties","distributed delays","global robust exponential stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5246284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Relaxed exponential stability condition for a class of uncertain time-delay neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5246284/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11239406","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaxed exponential stability condition for a class of uncertain time-delay neural networks","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA09157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049382S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226790","isNumber":"5244759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226790","xplore-issue":"5244759","articleId":"5246284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5246297,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Wada","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Mechanical Systems, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Takahiro Wada","id":"37329590300"},{"name":"Toyokazu Takeuchi","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Mechanical Systems, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Toyokazu Takeuchi","id":"37531311600"},{"name":"Masahiro Sekimoto","affiliation":["Research Organization of Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Sekimoto","id":"37285857900"},{"name":"Yuuki Shiba","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Mechanical Systems, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Yuuki Shiba","id":"37543608400"},{"name":"Suguru Arimoto","affiliation":["Research Organization of Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Suguru","lastName":"Arimoto","id":"37273965900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2692-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2693-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"5246297","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Legged locomotion","Leg","Knee","Motion measurement","Robot sensing systems","Force control","Motion analysis","Mechatronics","Design automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","handicapped aids","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait evaluation","transfemoral prosthesis","Riemannian distance","walking skill","daily living activity","swing phase","prosthesis inertia","multibody system","prosthesis leg"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Prosthesis leg","Easiness of walking","Riemannian distance","Iinertia-induced Measure","Inertia-induced Motion"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method to quantify the goodness of gait with a trans-femoral prosthesis in order to evaluate walking skill with the prosthesis and its application to its design. Advancements in the mechanism and the control method of trans-femoral prostheses have drastically improved the gait of amputees. However, realization of a natural gait has not been investigated in detail even though such smooth gait is important to increase the amputee's activities of daily living (ADL). Inertia of the prosthesis plays an important role in natural and smooth gaits during the swing phase. We suppose that goodness of gait or easiness of walking is strongly related to effective use of the prosthesis inertia. Recently, inertia-induced measure has been proposed as a measure to quantify inertiainduced motion of a multi-body system based on the Riemannian distance. In this paper, we will attempt to evaluate the goodness or easiness of walking with a prosthesis leg by quantifying the effective use of the prosthesis inertia based on the Riemannian distance. Gaits with several different inertia properties will be measured. The results will then demonstrate the strong relevance between subjective evaluation of easiness of walking and effective use of inertia evaluated based on the Riemannian distance.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246297","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226790/5244759/05246297.pdf","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5244759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of gait with trans-femoral prosthesis based on Riemannian distance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5246297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5246297/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of gait with trans-femoral prosthesis based on Riemannian distance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11239419","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5246297/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of gait with trans-femoral prosthesis based on Riemannian distance","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA09186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061875S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226790","isNumber":"5244759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226790","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5244759","articleId":"5246297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5246315,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Weili","affiliation":["Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Shi Weili","id":"37601608800"},{"name":"Miao Yu","affiliation":["Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Miao Yu","id":"37594119200"},{"name":"Chen Zhanfang","affiliation":["Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Chen Zhanfang","id":"37888998700"},{"name":"Zhang Hongbiao","affiliation":["Qiming Information Technology Company Limited, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Hongbiao","id":"37897508000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2692-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2693-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"5246315","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Image segmentation","Entropy","Equations","Histograms","Mathematics","Brain modeling","Deformable models","Mathematical model","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic medical image segmentation algorithm","Tsallis entropy","pulse coupled neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","PCNN","Tsallis entropy","Medical Image Segmentation"]}],"abstract":"It needs set parameters on image segmentation based on PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) now.

As simplified models, their error-functions could be defined directly as the quadratic objective function, from which we further derive the weight-updating formula of such a BPNN and the state-transition equation of such an HNN. It is shown creatively that the two derived learning-expressions turn out to be the same (in mathematics), although the presented neural-networks are evidently different from each other a great deal, in terms of network architecture, physical meaning and training patterns. Computer-simulations further substantiate the efficacy of both BPNN and HNN models on convex quadratic minimization and, more importantly, their common nature of learning.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246519","startPage":"2500","endPage":"2505","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226790/5244759/05246519.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5244759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common nature of learning between BP and hopfield-type neural networks for convex quadratic minimization with simplified network models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Hopfield neural networks","Quadratic programming","Robotics and automation","Service robots","Manipulator dynamics","Robotic assembly","Mechatronics","Information science","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","convex programming","Hopfield neural nets","mathematics computing","neural net architecture","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield-type neural networks","convex quadratic minimization","back-propagation neural network","discrete-time Hopfield-type neural network","error-function","quadratic objective function","weight-updating formula","state-transition equation","learning-expressions","network architecture","physical meaning","training patterns","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convex quadratic minimization","BP neural networks","Hopfield networks","common nature of learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5246519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Common nature of learning between BP and hopfield-type neural networks for convex quadratic minimization with simplified network models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5246519/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11239639","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common nature of learning between BP and hopfield-type neural networks for convex quadratic minimization with simplified network models","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA09456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091093S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226790","isNumber":"5244759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226790","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5244759","articleId":"5246519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5246544,"authors":[{"name":"Gannan Yuan","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Gannan Yuan","id":"37087304805"},{"name":"Jialin Tan","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Jialin Tan","id":"37088162568"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2692-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2693-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"5246544","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5246544","abstract":"A novel under-water terrain-aided navigation algorithm is proposed in this paper.

But the complex design process is impeding the development of extensive applications. This paper proposes an RSoC design methodology based on function-level programming model on account of the characteristics of the reconfigurable architecture. In the programming model, system designers use high-level language to complete functional specification by calling the co-function-library. Then the dynamic hardware/software partitioning algorithm will decide whether an invoked function should be running on hardware or software automatically.

Our method is based on the motivation: if the available exemplar texture is used as a prior to upsample the synthesized texture, a high resolution result that better preventing image blurring can be obtained. Our joint bilateral upsampling applies a spatial filter on the synthesized texture, and jointly applies a similar range filter on exemplar texture which guides the interpolation from low to high resolution. To further enhance the detail of the upsampled texture, we propose multi-scale joint bilateral upsampling method which progressively enhances the detail of the upsampled texture. In addition, we present a detail-aware texture optimization approach which combines texture optimization and histogram matching of the image detail to improve the quality of the synthesized results. Finally, we present an accelerated joint bilateral filter, which enables our upsampling process to interactively generate a large texture. We show results for upsampling image and video texture and compare them to traditional upsampling methods, which illustrate that our methods require low computational and memory costs while receive better results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5246805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CADCG.2009.5246915","publicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 11th IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234369/5246805/05246915.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"157","doi":"10.1109/CADCG.2009.5246915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multie-scale joint bilateral image and video texture upsampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multie-scale joint bilateral image and video texture upsampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5246915/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879398","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5246915/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multie-scale joint bilateral image and video texture upsampling","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049448S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234369","isNumber":"5246805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234369","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5246805","articleId":"5246915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5246952,"authors":[{"name":"F.

While this approach provides several electrical benefits, it also offers significant challenges in thermal management. While some work has been done in the past in this field, a comprehensive treatment is still lacking. In the current work, analytical and finite-element models of heat transfer in stacked 3D ICs are developed. The models are used to investigate the limits of thermal feasibility of 3D electronics and to determine the improvements required in traditional packaging in order to accommodate 3D ICs. An analytical model for temperature distribution in a multidie stack with multiple heat sources is developed. The analytical model is used to extend the traditional concept of a single-valued junction-to-air thermal resistance in an IC to thermal resistance and thermal sensitivity matrices for a 3D IC. The impact of various geometric parameters and thermophysical properties on thermal performance of a 3D IC is investigated. It is shown that package and heat sink thermal resistances play a more important role in determining temperature rise compared to thermal resistances intrinsic to the multidie stack. The improvement required in package and heat sink thermal resistances for a 3D logic-on-memory implementation to be thermally feasible is quantified. An increase in maximum temperature in a 3D IC compared to an equivalent system-in-package (SiP) is predicted. This increase is found to be mainly due to the reduced chip footprint. The increased memory die temperature in case of memory-on-logic integration compared to a SiP implementation is identified to be a significant thermal management challenge in the future. The results presented in this paper may be useful in the development of thermal design guidelines for 3D ICs, which are expected to help maximize the electrical benefits of 3D technology without exacerbating thermal management issues when implemented in early-stage electrical design and layout tools.","doi":"10.1109/TCAPT.2009.2020916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAPT.2009.2020916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6144/5429141/05247007.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5429141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical and Numerical Modeling of the Thermal Performance of Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analytical and Numerical Modeling of the Thermal Performance of Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","volume":"33","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11171834","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5247007/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical and Numerical Modeling of the Thermal Performance of Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcapt-ajain-2020916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06166S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6144","isNumber":"5429141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6144","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5429141","articleId":"5247007","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5247013,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Sani","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5280560/5247013/5247013-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Sani (S'07) received the Telecommunication Engineering degree from the University of Florence, Florence, Italy, in 2007, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in antennas and electromagnetic at Queen Mary, University of London, London, U.K.","In April 2007, he joined the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London.

The numerical analysis demonstrated that the radiation performances are strongly dependant on the location of wireless implants, as well as the body mass index of the subject. The results highlighted the significance of subject specific modeling when designing wireless implants. A link budget calculation was proposed for the communication between a left-ventricular wireless implant and an off-body base station as an example for MICS applications. It is demonstrated that, due to the presence of human tissues, the antenna radiation from wireless implants tends to be directive, and therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio in communication links is strongly dependent on the orientation of the human subject with respect to the base station.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10917925","htmlLink":"/document/5247013/","displayDocTitle":"Numerical Characterization and Link Budget Evaluation of Wireless Implants Considering Different Digital Human Phantoms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical Characterization and Link Budget Evaluation of Wireless Implants Considering Different Digital Human Phantoms","sourcePdf":"57tmtt10-asani-part2-2029770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063869S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5280560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5280560","articleId":"5247013","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5247017,"authors":[{"name":"Wing-Cheong Wong","affiliation":["Bioinformatic Institute (BII), Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore","School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Wing-Cheong Wong received the B.Eng. degree from the School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2002.","Currently, he is a Senior Research Associate in the Protein Sequence Analysis Group, Bioinformatic Institutes (BII), ASTAR, Biopolis, Singapore."]},"firstName":"Wing-Cheong","lastName":"Wong","id":"37898219700"},{"name":"Siu-Yeung Cho","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5306478/5247017/5247017-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Siu-Yeung Cho (M'00) received the B.Eng. degree (honors) from the University of Brighton, Brighton, U.K., in 1994 and the Ph.D. degree from the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 1999, both in electronic and computer engineering.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

However, it does not necessarily interact with its environment when the training data is assumed to be an accurate description of the environment under consideration. In interactive problems, it would be more appropriate for an agent to learn from its own experience through interactions with the environment, i.e., reinforcement learning. In this paper, three clustering algorithms are developed based on the reinforcement learning paradigm. This allows a more accurate description of the clusters as the clustering process is influenced by the reinforcement signal. They are the REINFORCE clustering technique I (RCT-I), the REINFORCE clustering technique II (RCT-II), and the episodic REINFORCE clustering technique (ERCT). The integrations of the RCT-I, the RCT-II, and the ERCT within the pseudo-outer product truth value restriction (POPTVR), which is a fuzzy neural network integrated with the truth restriction value (TVR) inference scheme in its five layered feedforward neural network, form the RPOPTVR-I, the RPOPTVR-II, and the ERPOPTVR, respectively. The Iris, Phoneme, and Spiral data sets are used for benchmarking. For both Iris and Phoneme data, the RPOPTVR is able to yield better classification results which are higher than the original POPTVR and the modified POPTVR over the three test trials. For the Spiral data set, the RPOPTVR-II is able to outperform the others by at least a margin of 5.8% over multiple test trials. The three reinforcement-based clustering techniques applied to the POPTVR network are able to exhibit the trial-and-error search characteristic that yields higher qualitative performance.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2029857","startPage":"1740","endPage":"1755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2029857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306478","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5306478/05247017.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"R-POPTVR: A Novel Reinforcement-Based POPTVR Fuzzy Neural Network for Pattern Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247017/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"R-POPTVR: A Novel Reinforcement-Based POPTVR Fuzzy Neural Network for Pattern Classification","volume":"20","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5247017/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10942704","pubMedId":"19770091","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"R-POPTVR: A Novel Reinforcement-Based POPTVR Fuzzy Neural Network for Pattern Classification","sourcePdf":"tnn-scho-2029857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116173S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5306478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5306478","articleId":"5247017","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5247023,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Rasit Yuce","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5280560/5247023/5247023-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehmet Rasit Yuce (S'01\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1997, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from North Carolina State University (NCSU), Raleigh, in 2004.","He is currently a Senior Lecturer with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, N.S.W., Australia.

Moreover, shortcomings of the original relaxation time sampling implementation, with polarization formulation, were identified, and the improved polarization implementation is provided as well. These implementations are compared with the implementation utilizing the fractional derivative formulation. All compared implementations require storing the electric field and some related auxiliary quantities for only the previous time step. It is observed that, for a single-term Cole-Cole relation, relaxation time sampling implementations can provide accuracy, storage requirement, and simulation time comparable to the ones for the fractional derivative implementation. However, the latter does not exist for the more general multiterm Cole-Cole dispersion relation, for which the implementations based on the relaxation time sampling could be easily extended to.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2029767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5280560/05247024.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2029767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280560","startPage":"2588","endPage":"2596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD Modeling of Biological Tissues Cole\u2013Cole Dispersion for 0.5\u201330 GHz Using Relaxation Time Distribution Samples\u2014Novel and Improved Implementations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Modeling of Biological Tissues Cole\u2013Cole Dispersion for 0.5\u201330 GHz Using Relaxation Time Distribution Samples\u2014Novel and Improved Implementations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917920","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5247024/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Modeling of Biological Tissues Cole\u2013Cole Dispersion for 0.5\u201330 GHz Using Relaxation Time Distribution Samples\u2014Novel and Improved Implementations","sourcePdf":"57tmtt10-mtofighi-part2-2029767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080392S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5280560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5280560","articleId":"5247024","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247025,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Although the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm yields the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution, its sensitivity to the selection of the starting parameters is well-known and it may converge to the boundary of the parameter space. Furthermore, the resulting mixture depends on the number of selected components, but the optimal number of kernels may be unknown beforehand. We introduce the use of the entropy of the probability density function (pdf) associated to each kernel to measure the quality of a given mixture model with a fixed number of kernels. We propose two methods to approximate the entropy of each kernel and a modification of the classical EM algorithm in order to find the optimum number of components of the mixture. Moreover, we use two stopping criteria: a novel global mixture entropy-based criterion called Gaussianity deficiency (GD) and a minimum description length (MDL) principle-based one. Our algorithm, called entropy-based EM (EBEM), starts with a unique kernel and performs only splitting by selecting the worst kernel attending to GD. We have successfully tested it in probability density estimation, pattern classification, and color image segmentation. Experimental results improve the ones of other state-of-the-art model order selection methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10942705","pubMedId":"19770090","htmlLink":"/document/5247027/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning Gaussian Mixture Models With Entropy-Based Criteria","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Gaussian Mixture Models With Entropy-Based Criteria","sourcePdf":"tnn-apealverbenavent-2030190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093824S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5306478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5306478","articleId":"5247027","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247028,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Ito","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design and Informatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5280579/5247028/5247028-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiroshi Ito (S'92\u2013M'96\u2013SM'09) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Keio University, Japan, in 1990, 1992 and 1995, respectively.","From 1994 to 1995, he was a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

The treatment of iISS and input-to-state stable (ISS) systems is unified. Both necessary conditions and sufficient conditions are investigated using a Lyapunov formulation. In the presence of model uncertainty, this paper proves that, for the stability of the interconnected system, at least one subsystem is necessarily ISS which is a stronger stability property in the set of iISS. The necessity of a small-gain-type property is also demonstrated. This paper proposes a common form of smooth Lyapunov functions which can establish the iISS and the ISS of the interconnection comprising iISS and ISS subsystems whenever the small-gain-type condition is satisfied. The result covers situations more general than the earlier study and removes technical conditions assumed in the previous literature.

Special emphasis is put in the analysis of the NPC-based three-phase/-level PWM rectifier operating as power factor corrector.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2032365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5440038/05247034.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2032365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Phase Multilevel PWM Rectifiers Based on Conventional Bidirectional Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247034/","displayDocTitle":"Three-Phase Multilevel PWM Rectifiers Based on Conventional Bidirectional Converters","volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11205771","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5247034/","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Phase Multilevel PWM Rectifiers Based on Conventional Bidirectional Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-heldwein-2032365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066983S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5440038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5440038","articleId":"5247034","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247037,"authors":[{"name":"Gesualdo Scutari","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5379139/5247037/5247037-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gesualdo Scutari (S'05\u2013M'06) received the Electrical Engineering and Ph.D. degrees (both with honors) from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","During 2003, he held a visiting research appointment at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley; during 2007 and 2008, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong; during 2009 he was a Research Associate in the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the INFOCOM Department, University of Rome, \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy.

In this paper we propose and analyze a totally decentralized approach, based on game theory, to design cognitive MIMO transceivers, who compete with each other to maximize their information rate. The formulation incorporates constraints on the transmit power as well as null and/or soft shaping constraints on the transmit covariance matrix, so that the interference generated by secondary users be confined within the temperature-interference limit required by the primary users. We provide a unified set of conditions that guarantee the uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the Nash equilibrium of all the proposed games through totally distributed and asynchronous algorithms. Interestingly, the proposed algorithms overcome the main drawback of classical waterfilling based algorithms-the violation of the temperature-interference limit-and they have the desired features required for CR applications, such as low-complexity, distributed implementation, robustness against missing or outdated updates of the users, and fast convergence behavior.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Cognitive Radio: A Game Theoretical Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2032039","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05247037.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2032039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Cognitive Radio: A Game Theoretical Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5247037/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11084089","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Cognitive Radio: A Game Theoretical Approach","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-gscutari-2032039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162257S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5247037","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247040,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio E.

The specific features of IVC will allow the deployment of a wide set of possible applications, which span from road safety to entertainment. Even if, on the one hand, these applications share the common need for fast multihop message propagation, on the other hand, they possess distinct characteristics in terms of generated network traffic. The state of the art of current research only proposes solutions specifically designed for a single application (or class) that is not directly extendable to a general IVC context. Instead, we claim that a privileged architecture exists, which is able to support the whole spectrum of application classes. To this aim, we propose a novel IVC architecture that adapts its functionalities to efficiently serve applications by quickly propagating their messages over a vehicular network. We conducted an extensive set of experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. As representative case studies, we considered two application classes that, for their network traffic characteristics, are at the opposite boundaries of the application spectrum: safety and entertainment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2009.2029078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420295","startPage":"90","endPage":"99","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5420295/05247040.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intervehicular Communication Architecture for Safety and Entertainment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5247040/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Intervehicular Communication Architecture for Safety and Entertainment","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11151959","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intervehicular Communication Architecture for Safety and Entertainment","sourcePdf":"tits-roccetti-2029078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065587S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5420295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"5420295","articleId":"5247040","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5247043,"authors":[{"name":"Weichao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5379139/5247043/5247043-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weichao Xu (M'06) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, in 1993 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from the University of Hong Kong in 2002.","Since 2003, he has been a Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong.

To gain further insight into GC, we also compare the Gini correlation to other two closely related correlation coefficients, namely, the order statistics correlation coefficient (OSCC) and Spearman's rho (SR). Theoretical and simulation results suggest that the performance of GC lies in between those of OSCC and SR when estimating the correlation coefficient of the bivariate normal population.

The parameterization has the form of a linear system whose variables are the coefficients of two positive trigonometric polynomials. The parameterization allows the easy separation of independent variables and can be used to transform the optimization of HD-DWT into semidefinite programming (SDP) form. Using the parameterization, we are able to optimize filters whose length is greater than the minimal one imposed by regularity constraints. We also propose two optimization methods for the dual-tree HD-DWT. The first generalizes the design based on allpass approximation of the half sample delay.

The goal is to identify the portions of the spectrum that are unused by primary user systems and other CR systems, called existing user (EU) systems altogether, with the emphasis on conquering the challenge imposed by multipath fading channel. The sensing of EU systems consists of two steps. In the first step, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the frequency bands of EU systems are calculated; in the second step, detection is performed at each suspected band to decide whether an EU system is truly in operation. The idea is that an EU system appears at a segment of continuous subcarriers. This fact can be exploited by employing measurements at a continual subcarriers and executing the sensing along the frequency domain. An autoregressive (AR) model is adopted to track the variation of the received EU signal strength along frequencies. It is shown by simulations that the proposed spectrum sensing algorithm is robust in a severe frequency-selective fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2032453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05247047.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2032453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","startPage":"709","endPage":"719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sensing in Wideband OFDM Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing in Wideband OFDM Cognitive Radios","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054920","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5247047/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing in Wideband OFDM Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-chwang-2032453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087824S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5247047","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247049,"authors":[{"name":"Satyabrata Sen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Satyabrata","lastName":"Sen","id":"37411627200"},{"name":"Arye Nehorai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Arye","lastName":"Nehorai","id":"37265777100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5247049","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1798},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","OFDM","Radar scattering","Delay","Matched filters","Landmine detection","Wideband","Autocorrelation","Signal resolution","Scattering parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM radar signal adaptive design","wideband ambiguity function","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveform","auto-correlation function","mutlicarrier OFDM signal","optimization algorithm","matched filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive waveform design","multifrequency scattering","OFDM radar","wideband ambiguity function"]}],"abstract":"We propose an adaptive technique to design the spectrum of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform to improve the radar's wideband ambiguity function (WAF). The adaptive OFDM signal yields a better auto-correlation function (ACF) that results into an improved delay (range) resolution for the radar system. First, we develop a mutlicarrier OFDM signal model and the corresponding WAF at the output of the matched filter, emphasizing that the received signal depends on the scattering parameters of the target. Then, we devise an optimization procedure to select the OFDM waveform such that the volume of the corresponding WAF best approximates the volume of a desired ambiguity function. We demonstrate the improvement in the resulting ambiguity function, along with the associated ACF, through numerical examples. We find that the optimization algorithm puts more signal energy at subcarriers in which the target response is weaker.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Design of OFDM Radar Signal With Improved Wideband Ambiguity Function","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2032456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05247049.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2032456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247049/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Design of OFDM Radar Signal With Improved Wideband Ambiguity Function","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5247049/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054917","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Design of OFDM Radar Signal With Improved Wideband Ambiguity Function","sourcePdf":"58tsp02-anehorai-2032456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05834S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5247049","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247053,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Nano Science and Technology, SKKU Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea","Thin Film Materials Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5319722/5247053/5247053-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gang Zhang (S'07) received the B.Eng.

We compare three detection schemes: (1) synchronous detection with data from a photodetector and clock from an external source; (2) asynchronous detection with data and clock from the all-optically thresholded signal received by a clock and data recovery (CDR) unit; and (3) asynchronous detection with data from a photodetector and clock extracted from the all-optically thresholded signal using CDR.

Then, we exploit the vector perturbation (VP) technique to further improve the system performance of the multiuser downlink. To directly reduce the high complexity of VP by a sphere encoder, we provide an LR-based sphere encoder and LR-based approximations for perturbation symbols. Performance and complexity analyses are given to show the advantages of the proposed schemes. Particularly, the diversity-gain analysis shows some insights of the existing and proposed schemes.

The structure consists of two decoupled modules: the first is for adaptive filtering of input signals, and the second is for frequency estimation. A suitable and robust algorithm for frequency estimation is obtained. This technique provides better performance, compared with the technique based on a single-phase signal in relation to waveforms with noise. The technique is particularly important when asymmetric sags generate zero voltage in one of the three phases. In addition, it allows the measurement of the instantaneous frequency value of real signals for single- or three-phase systems. To demonstrate the performance of the developed algorithm, computer-simulated data records and calibrator-generated signals are processed. The proposed algorithm has been put to test with distorted three-phase voltage signals. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Frequency estimation","Power systems","Filtering algorithms","Adaptive filters","Voltage fluctuations","Sampling methods","Noise robustness","Distortion measurement","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","filtering theory","frequency estimation","least squares approximations","power systems","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","three-phase power system","weighted-least-square algorithm","adaptive FIR filtering","three-phase voltage signals","single-phase signal","asymmetric sags","computer-simulated data records","calibrator-generated signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filtering","finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter","frequency estimation","frequency measurement","harmonics","median filter","recursive algorithm","three-phase power system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2023816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5374018/05247085.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5374018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2023816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Estimation of Three-Phase Power System Using Weighted-Least-Square Algorithm and Adaptive FIR Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Estimation of Three-Phase Power System Using Weighted-Least-Square Algorithm and Adaptive FIR Filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247085/","volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5247085/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11054166","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Estimation of Three-Phase Power System Using Weighted-Least-Square Algorithm and Adaptive FIR Filtering","sourcePdf":"tim-kusljevic-2023816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100036S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5374018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5374018","articleId":"5247085","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5247096,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Furthermore, the new pixel structure is able to drastically minimize in-pixel random-telegraph-signal noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5290333/05247097.pdf","startPage":"2390","endPage":"2397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2030600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2030600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel Buried-Channel Source Follower and Optimized Row Selector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Noise","Logic gates","Transistors","Current measurement","Noise measurement","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","image resolution","photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","in-pixel buried-channel source follower","optimized row selector","pinned-photodiode","nMOS transistor surface-mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Buried-channel source follower (BSF)","CMOS image sensor (CIS)","optimized row selector","random-telegraph-signal (RTS) noise","4T-active-pixel sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel Buried-Channel Source Follower and Optimized Row Selector","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5247097/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929299","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel Buried-Channel Source Follower and Optimized Row Selector","sourcePdf":"ted-chen-2030600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05059S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5290333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5290333","articleId":"5247097","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247099,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Molina","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Molina","id":"38182332500"},{"name":"Nestor Becerra Yoma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Nestor Becerra","lastName":"Yoma","id":"37328752700"},{"name":"Fernando Huenup\u00e1n","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Huenup\u00e1n","id":"37888664400"},{"name":"Claudio Garret\u00f3n","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Garret\u00f3n","id":"37399051000"},{"name":"Jorge Wuth","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Wuth","id":"37888664100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"5247099","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":671},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel confidence-based reinforcement learning (RL) scheme to correct observation log-likelihoods and to address the problem of unsupervised compensation with limited estimation data is proposed. A two-step Viterbi decoding is presented which estimates a correction factor for the observation log-likelihoods that makes the recognized and neighboring HMMs more or less likely by using a confidence score. If regions in the output delivered by the recognizer exhibit low confidence scores, the second Viterbi decoding will tend to focus the search on neighboring models. In contrast, if recognized regions exhibit high confidence scores, the second Viterbi decoding will tend to retain the recognition output obtained at the first step. The proposed RL mechanism is modeled as the linear combination of two metrics or information sources: the acoustic model log-likelihood and the logarithm of a confidence metric. A criterion based on incremental conditional entropy maximization to optimize a linear combination of metrics or information sources online is also presented. The method requires only one utterance, as short as 0.7 s, and can lead to significant reductions in word error rate (WER) between 3% and 18%, depending on the task, training-testing conditions, and method used to optimize the proposed RL scheme. In contrast to ordinary feature compensation and model parameter adaptation methods, the confidence-based RL method takes place in the frame log-likelihood domain. Consequently, as shown in the results presented here, it is complementary to feature compensation and to model adaptation techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5485195/05247099.pdf","startPage":"1041","endPage":"1052","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2032618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2032618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5485195","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Entropy-Based Reinforcement Learning Using a Confidence Measure in Speech Recognition for Telephone Speech","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning","Speech recognition","Telephony","Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Adaptation model","Hidden Markov models","Entropy","Error analysis","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","optimisation","speech recognition","unsupervised learning","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum entropy-based reinforcement learning","speech recognition","telephone speech","confidence-based reinforcement learning","unsupervised compensation","limited estimation data","two-step Viterbi decoding","correction factor","neighboring HMM","metrics linear combination","information sources","acoustic model log-likelihood","confidence metric logarithm","conditional entropy maximization","word error rate","WER","training-testing conditions","feature compensation","model parameter adaptation methods","confidence-based RL method","model adaptation techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Confidence measure","incremental conditional entropy","reinforcement learning","robust automatic speech recognition","telephone speech"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Entropy-Based Reinforcement Learning Using a Confidence Measure in Speech Recognition for Telephone Speech","volume":"18","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11392227","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Entropy-Based Reinforcement Learning Using a Confidence Measure in Speech Recognition for Telephone Speech","sourcePdf":"tasl-yoma-2032618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085741S","chronDate":"July  2010","isNumber":"5485195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5247099","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247102,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Cenciarini","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5393902/5247102/5247102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Massimo Cenciarini (S\u201909) received the Laureate degree in electronic engineering with a specialization in biomedical engineering at the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2001.

A compensatory balance response often observed in older adults is increased co-contraction, which is generally assumed to enhance stability by increasing joint stiffness. We investigated the effect of aging on standing balance by fitting body sway data to a previously developed postural control model that includes active and passive stiffness and damping parameters. Ten young (24 \u00b1 3 years) and seven older (75 \u00b1 5 years) adults were exposed during eyes-closed stance to perturbations consisting of lateral pseudorandom floor tilts. A least-square fit of the measured body sway data to the postural control model found significantly larger active stiffness and damping model parameters in the older adults. These differences remained significant even after normalizing to account for different body sizes between the young and older adult groups. An age effect was also found for the normalized passive stiffness, but not for the normalized passive damping parameter. This concurrent increase in active stiffness and damping was shown to be more stabilizing than an increase in stiffness alone, as assessed by oscillations in the postural control model impulse response.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Biomedical engineering","Control systems","Motion detection","Aging","Biological system modeling","Gravity","Head","Muscles","Tendons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","bone","damping","geriatrics","mechanoception","perturbation techniques","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","upright balance","passive mechanism","active mechanism","aging","compensatory balance response","older adults","co-contraction","joint stiffness","standing balance","fitting body sway data","postural control model","eyes-closed stance","lateral pseudorandom floor tilts","least-square fit","perturbations","body sizes","oscillations","impulse response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aging","balance","modeling","postural control"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Age Factors","Aged","Feedback, Physiological","Female","Humans","Least-Squares Analysis","Male","Models, Biological","Postural Balance","Posture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2031874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5393902/05247102.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2031874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stiffness and Damping in Postural Control Increase With Age","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stiffness and Damping in Postural Control Increase With Age","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247102/","volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5247102/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11071379","pubMedId":"19770083","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stiffness and Damping in Postural Control Increase With Age","sourcePdf":"tbme-loughlin-2031874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06305S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5393902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5393902","articleId":"5247102","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":5247106,"authors":[{"name":"Piet M.

The data are approximated then by multiple equidistant missing-data sets within the same time frame, resampled with a multishift slotted nearest neighbor method. This resampling uses a fraction of the resampling time step as slot width. A special autoregressive (AR) estimator for multiple data sets with missing observations has been developed for the estimation of the power spectral density of this resampled signal. The algorithm estimates AR models for increasing model orders from the data and automatically selects the best order for the data from a number of candidates. Further, that selected AR model is used to estimate moving average (MA) and combined autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models as possible candidates for the data. Unfortunately, equidistant resampling always causes shift bias due to the shift of the observation times to an equidistant grid. This bias is sometimes the cause of spurious AR poles at higher frequencies. Therefore, the selected AR model order can have spurious high-frequency poles, incompatible with the continuous-time character of the irregularly sampled signal. The elimination of those impossible poles produces a corrected spectrum that will generally be a better approximation of the true irregular spectrum.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5350927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2022451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5350927/05247106.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"214","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2022451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Removal of Spurious Spectral Peaks From Autoregressive Models for Irregularly Sampled Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"The Removal of Spurious Spectral Peaks From Autoregressive Models for Irregularly Sampled Data","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5247106/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11019122","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247106/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Removal of Spurious Spectral Peaks From Autoregressive Models for Irregularly Sampled Data","sourcePdf":"tim-broersen-2022451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052742S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5350927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5350927","articleId":"5247106","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5247107,"authors":[{"name":"Changzhi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5406264/5247107/5247107-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changzhi Li (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2004 from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.","In August 2009, he joined the Texas Tech University, Lubbock, as an Assistant Professor.

The Doppler radar first captures and downconverts the wireless signal that is phase modulated by the physiological movements, and then identifies the human heartbeat and respiration rates by processing the baseband signal. When nonlinear Doppler phase modulation is employed to monitor vital signs without contact, one of the challenges that we encounter is the presence of undesired harmonic terms and intermodulations other than the sinusoids of interest. A spectral estimation algorithm is needed to accurately estimate the sinusoidal frequencies before identifying the heartbeat and respiration rates. The conventional periodogram cannot reliably separate the rich sinusoidal components since it suffers from smearing and leakage problems, particularly for the case of limited data samples. A parametric and cyclic optimization approach, referred to as the RELAX algorithm, is instead suggested to mitigate these difficulties. Both simulated and experimental results are provided to validate the superiority of using the RELAX algorithm for accurate noncontact vital sign detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Doppler Radar Noncontact Vital Sign Detection Using the RELAX Algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2025986","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5406264/05247107.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2025986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Doppler Radar Noncontact Vital Sign Detection Using the RELAX Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5247107/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105465","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Doppler Radar Noncontact Vital Sign Detection Using the RELAX Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tim-li-2025986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072676S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5406264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5406264","articleId":"5247107","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5247111,"authors":[{"name":"Bradley W.

The main filter task is to mitigate current dynamics in the dc distribution system in order to prolong the operational life of delicate dc supplies, i.e., fuel cells, and to reduce the electromagnetic interferences between sensitive electronic circuits connected to the distribution net. The active stage is incorporated into the passive part in order to: 1) improve its insufficient attenuation in the low-frequency range and 2) source or sink any surplus energy flow between the dc source and load in case of low-frequency current dynamics. Two active stage topologies are proposed, analyzed, and evaluated in detail: 1) an active filter based on a single-leg inverter and 2) an active filter based on an electronic smoothing inductor. A special focus is on achieving attenuation at different voltage levels of the auxiliary supply and at different coupling inductances. The impact of the current ripple generated by the switching mode of the active filter operation is discussed as well. The active filter based on the single-leg inverter offers superior attenuation, particularly in the low-frequency range where attenuation is improved nearly for 15 dB compared to the passive filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5247114/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11137554","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Study of a Hybrid Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of a Hybrid Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-ostroznik-2031666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098446S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5410131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5410131","articleId":"5247114","onlineDate":"18 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5247122,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Boem Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5247118/5247122/5247122-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sung-Boem Park received the B.

On-chip recorders collect instruction footprints (information about flows of instructions and what the instructions did as they passed through various design blocks) during the normal operation of the processor in a post-silicon system validation setup. Upon system failure, the recorded information is scanned out and analyzed offline for bug localization. Special self-consistency-based program analysis techniques, together with the test program binary of the application executed during post-silicon validation, are used for this purpose. Major benefits of using IFRA over traditional techniques for post-silicon bug localization are as follows: 1) it does not require full system-level reproduction of bugs, and 2) it does not require full system-level simulation. Simulation results on a complex superscalar processor demonstrate that IFRA is effective in accurately localizing electrical bugs with very little impact on overall chip area.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2030595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5247118/05247122.pdf","startPage":"1545","endPage":"1558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2030595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post-Silicon Bug Localization in Processors Using Instruction Footprint Recording and Analysis (IFRA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247122/","displayDocTitle":"Post-Silicon Bug Localization in Processors Using Instruction Footprint Recording and Analysis (IFRA)","volume":"28","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10870696","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5247122/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post-Silicon Bug Localization in Processors Using Instruction Footprint Recording and Analysis (IFRA)","sourcePdf":"tcad-park-2030595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161918S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5247118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5247118","articleId":"5247122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247124,"authors":[{"name":"Gerasimos Konstantatos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada","Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5247123/5247124/5247124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gerasimos Konstantatos received the Diploma from the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, in 2001 and the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2004 and 2008, respectively, all in electrical and computer engineering.","He was a Research Associate with the Electromagnetics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, from 2001 to 2002.

This approach typically either mandates the use of silicon as photon-to-electron converter or requires a hybrid-integrated solution. In contrast, solution-processed optoelectronic materials offer convenient integration of light-sensing materials atop an electronic readout circuit. Colloidal quantum dots offer particular advantages, combining solution-processing with the spectral tunability afforded by the quantum size effect. Here we review recent progress in solution-processed quantum dot photodetectors and their application in future imaging systems. We focus on progress towards high responsivity (photon-to-electron gains exceeding 1000) and sensitivity (normalized detectivity D* ~ 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">13</sup>\nJones) in the visible, the near infrared, and the short-wavelength infrared.

The tasks have probabilistic execution times and are executed on discrete operation modes providing different utilities with different energy consumptions. We first design an optimal offline scheduling scheme that stochastically maximizes the cumulative utility of the tasks under energy constraints, at the cost of heavy computational overhead. Next, the optimal offline scheme is modified to an approximate online scheduling scheme. The online scheme has little runtime overhead and yields almost the maximum utility, with an energy budget that is given at runtime. The difference between the maximum utility and the output utility of the online scheme is bounded by a controllable input value. Extensive evaluation shows that the output utility of the online scheme approaches the maximum utility in most cases, and is much higher than that of existing methods by up to 50% of the largest utility difference among available operation modes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10870700","htmlLink":"/document/5247147/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-Utility Scheduling of Operation Modes With Probabilistic Task Execution Times Under Energy Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-Utility Scheduling of Operation Modes With Probabilistic Task Execution Times Under Energy Constraints","sourcePdf":"tcad-lee-2026352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150787S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5247118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5247118","articleId":"5247147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247148,"authors":[{"name":"Rajat Subhra Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5247118/5247148/5247148-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajat Subhra Chakraborty (S'07) received the B.

Most recently, many approaches and tools that claim to realize and support a design process at the so-called electronic system level (ESL) have emerged. However, faced with the vast complexity challenges, in most cases at best, only partial solutions are available. In this paper, we develop and propose a novel classification for ESL synthesis tools, and we will present six different academic approaches in this context. Based on these observations, we can identify such common principles and needs as they are leading toward and are ultimately required for a true ESL synthesis solution, covering the whole design process from specification to implementation for complete systems across hardware and software boundaries.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic System-Level Synthesis Methodologies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2026356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5247118/05247153.pdf","startPage":"1517","endPage":"1530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2026356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247118","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5247153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5247153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Electronic System-Level Synthesis Methodologies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5247153/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10878849","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic System-Level Synthesis Methodologies","sourcePdf":"tcad-gerstlauer-2026356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140029S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5247118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5247118","articleId":"5247153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5247174,"authors":[{"name":"Lanny L.

Another result was the first solution of the dRAM alpha particle soft error problem using the combination of Hamming error-correcting codes, particle range data, and separation of bits on nonadjacent bit lines. His high-resolution ADC and DAC work relies on litho-friendly design without autocalibration. This work includes an 18-b CMOS DAC IC that was licensed to Toshiba for high-volume production in early 4\u00d7 OS audio disc players, a 14-b CMOS ADC IC that was the first converter used for DSL in the United States and Europe by industry-pioneers PairGain and Alcatel, and a 1.2 mW 16-b CMOS ADC \u00d736-array in an image-processing ASIC (SIDECAR) that replaced the main survey camera (ACS) image processor in the May 2009 Hubble space telescope servicing mission (SM-4). That ADC design will be used again in the main IR camera (NIRCAM) of the next-generation space telescope (JWST), scheduled to fly in 2014. His current circuit design work includes overcoming headroom problems resulting from device voltage limitations in nanometer analog CMOS circuits. That work includes high speed (1\u201310 GHz), high resolution (10\u201314b) CMOS pipeline ADCs, comparators, amplifiers, low-jitter clock distribution, and the next-generation low-power 10 GBS SERDES line driver for the SnowBush IP Division of Gennum in 28 nm CMOS technology. His physical design work is focused on overcoming stress, lithography, and reliability limitations in deep submicrometer processes. This work also includes the development and refinement of dimensionless schematic capture and layout techniques to port designs from micrometer technology nodes down through 28 nm. His past positions include Manager, Nuclear Space Instrument Development, NASA-JPL; Director of R&D, Pacemaker Division, American Hospital Supply; Manager, Advanced CMOS Circuit Development, Hughes Solid State Products Division; and Manager, Analog IC Design, Pargain Division, Globespan Inc.

The nature of these nonidealities has been well reported in the technical literature. They include hot carrier injection and time-dependent dielectric breakdown effects limiting supply voltage, stress and lithographic effects limiting matching accuracy, electromigration effects limiting conductor lifetime, leakage and mobility effects limiting device performance, and chip power dissipation limits driving individual circuits to be more energy-efficient. The lack of analog design and simulation tools available to address these problems has become the focus of a significant effort with the electronic design automation industry. Postlayout simulation tools are not useful during the design phase, while technology computer-aided design physical simulation tools are slow and not in common use by analog circuit designers. In the nanoscale era of analog CMOS design, an understanding of the physical factors affecting circuit reliability and performance, as well as methods of mitigating or overcoming them, is becoming increasingly important. The first part of the paper presents factors affecting device matching, including those relating to single devices as well as local and long-distance matching effects. Several reliability effects are discussed, including physical design limitations projected for future downscaling. In some cases, it may be helpful to exceed foundry-specified drain-source voltage limits by a few hundred millivolts. Models are presented for achieving this, which include the dependence on the shape of the output waveform. The condition \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Vsb</i>\n > 0 is required for cascode circuit configurations.

The second part of the paper focuses on trends in device characteristics and how they influence the design of nanoscale analog CMOS circuits. A number of circuit design techniques employed to address the major nonidealities of nanoscale CMOS technologies are discussed. Examples include techniques for establishing on-chip accurate and temperature-insensitive bias currents, digital calibration of analog circuits, and the design of regulator and high-voltage circuits.
